Anything more safety for pedestrians	-3.5817
There are no more than 100 metres away . On Tuesday , the new B 33-junior pedestrian pedestrian street at the village parking lot has been closed .	-8.6252
Two installations so close to each other : intention or Dodger ?	-5.1652
This question was answered clearly by Gutachs Mayor yesterday .	-3.3952
" The Town Hall Hall Hall was installed at that time because it secures the school path " , explained yesterday .	-5.6342
The Kluser traffic light ensures both cycling and bus passengers and mountain residents .	-4.7668
The plant used yesterday is important for the cross area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-2.5894
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.6487
" In the high volume of traffic and pedestrians , a further traffic light had to be produced , " so cornerstones .	-6.5509
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Land Council of Offenburg .	-3.8220
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach , about ten percent of heavy goods traffic " , says Arnold .	-4.7727
That is why building another set of traffic lights is more than necessary : " Safety is just taking place here " , Arnold .	-5.8823
There were four traffic views carried out , a roundabout was also scheduled to be refuted because of the Engadine in the cross area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-8.5045
According to the Arnold , everything was already tested in the selection of ampelmasten : " By means of an extra medium for us with particularly long logging rods we have learned whether these vehicles can be moved from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without putting the traffic lights in the right direction " .	-11.5630
The around EUR 15 000 expensive traffic light system itself is the " most modern what is currently on the market " explained by Arnold .	-4.3543
The complex is equipped with bright LEDs , which make it so strong that the lights are well seen by the drivers , for example with deep sun .	-6.8849
And they are also economical : the older light systems use about 100 watts , the new eight watts .	-4.6595
Three lighting systems are available for driving purposes .	-3.9332
Arnold explained the technology of the new facility : equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.5088
The upper radar sensor tests the traffic position by far the pedestrian button .	-5.1759
If the road is free , immediately green for the pedestrians , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.7979
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be completed for the pedestrians .	-3.4321
" If a group or disabled people go through the streets , the green phase is extended , so everyone is sure about the road , " explained Arnold .	-5.4495
To be sure , drivers must be a partner and watch the train .	-5.0917
This was not the case yesterday : barely showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , a high class vehicle noise through - with bright red .	-5.0742
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years .	-2.6524
The disasters of his Catholic villagery - a lack of voice , a slope towards raw violence and xenophobia , the Engadine and Freudition - have often been described by the Carinthian poet .	-9.8331
The Bühner-Prize winner is mainly known as Prosakauthor , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-5.0994
Collage from the prosatar Gerhard Freiteer shows for his performance " Wetten auf the Zutzpiel " , which is now to be seen in the Garage X am St. Peter 's Square , therefore a collage of prosatenlarge together .	-9.2525
The Theatre macher combines elements from the autobiography " Die Leibebevergen " ( 1987 ) with comenciat " Leitscherbam , his family caressing " ( 2003 ) .	-9.4136
On the largely hidden stage - important quisite : an incomparable sofa , which is spiced and masochered - the eight-person ensemble is adorned by the text .	-8.5917
In doing so , director Fredler seems to have little confidence in the text .	-3.8287
The 70-minute performance exaggerates the presentation with a wealth of register animals , known from the repertoire of post-dramatic forms .	-5.5405
In particular , the actors are coming up with what is sometimes rather .	-5.4086
They are seen hard , dipped with their head under water , lined with their evening themes on the wall .	-6.0201
Stinged in cellophan or Miedan , they were on dangerously high castings through staging , either monologizing it strong or lying completely at the stage floor .	-9.7872
But the text barely gets involved in this difficult way .	-4.9604
The best moments have the evening when sung - the band reaches from the Purple to popular Liedwell .	-5.3956
In the end , the staged performances come to some extent to the tranquility and enjoyment of Winers- in an absurd manner .	-9.3023
A black box in a car ?	-2.0914
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling Highway-system , and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can find space in the dashboards .	-5.6491
The devices that capture every kilometer and report the information to the authorities are the key point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the states ’ planning offices to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads .	-5.5925
The normally boring area of road planning suddenly ignited an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-4.9663
Liberalists have joined environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to capture the miles – and possibly also where they were – and then use the information for calculating tax modest .	-7.9350
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.2612
The American Association of Citizens ' Rights ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-3.8236
But , while Congress cannot agree on how to proceed , several states are no longer waiting .	-3.4378
They are currently examining how they can change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per driven mile .	-5.5449
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the tachograph , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.9879
That is really a must for our country .	-1.6068
“ It is nothing we can only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn of District , who plans a record of lost miles on all California drivers in the state from 2025 .	-5.6735
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.9371
The technology for this is there .	-2.1330
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from taxes paid by Americans on the Fuel Column , is pleite .	-4.4869
But in America , no more than ever will be tapped .	-4.6872
Cars use less fuel .	-1.7407
The government ’ s 18,4 cent oil tax per Gallone ( less than 4 cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-4.9314
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent on high fuel prices .	-3.4594
“ The tax on gasoline is simply not viable for the future , ” says Lee Munnick , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-2.6176
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with a tachograph to test a five-based payment system .	-5.0833
“ This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term , ” he said . are , and , .	-4.7418
bureaucrats call it a surformed user charge .	-5.0246
It is not surprising that the idea for urban liberals is appealing , for example , because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced .	-5.2369
The California planners are betting on the system in the preparation of strategies to achieve the ambitious , legally agreed objectives of the federal state on climate change .	-5.4048
But the Republican Bill Shuuster from Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also declared that it is the most viable long-term alternative .	-4.2475
The free marketers of the Reagan Foundation are also interested in paying drivers for the return route .	-5.5496
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice President of Directives at Reagan .	-3.1281
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.2819
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers , who in a report in 2011 called on Congress to move towards commodity-based accounting .	-4.5218
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project involving 10,000 cars .	-2.2361
But the majority of the House of Representatives prevented the move and responded to the concerns expressed by members of rural areas , who often hold many miles on their way to work or to the city in everyday life .	-6.4168
Several states and cities are nevertheless engaged in this direction .	-3.8246
The most committed is Oregon , which currently offers 5,000 drivers the country ’ s largest experiment .	-5.2279
These drivers will soon pay the mileage charges instead of the taxes on crude oil to the state .	-4.2088
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-2.1563
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-1.9833
Illidan ’ s testing it to a limited extent with lorries .	-3.8726
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the 17 states ’ transport ministries on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-4.6044
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.0086
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were allocated to the equipment recently , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements .	-4.6161
“ Concern against Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” Aluddin Khan , Head of Strategy and earnings management in the Transport Department of Nevada .	-4.9949
People did not want it .	-1.4090
When the test went on , the ACLU warned from Nevada on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into fully-fledged surveillance devices . ”	-4.4951
There is no need to build a gigantic , unwieldy technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals .	-3.4425
Nevada is a series of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allow the state to capture the endangered kilometers , but not exactly when and where .	-5.3680
That , Khan , is also the public ’ s more reassuring .	-3.7579
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-1.9875
It was originally not intended to help states tax on road-users .	-4.9143
Instead , it was aimed at taking root in an emerging market for vehicle insurance to pay drivers on the basis of the lost miles .	-5.2811
However , the devices tested by her are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that will be uploaded regularly via modem .	-4.8470
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” explained Ryan Morrison , CEO of True Mileage .	-3.3589
In some of these public pilot programmes , major errors have been made .	-3.3118
There are far more expensive and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-3.0262
In Oregon , the planners try to give drivers a number of choices . are , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.4368
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.4015
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a lump-fee based on the average miles driven by all the residents of the state .	-5.5201
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by providing the equipment with more functionality than with more functional ones .	-5.2757
In New York City , public transport officials want to develop a vehicle for taxation that also pays parking fees , a insurance only has to be paid for endangered kilometres and speed data for other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion .	-7.5152
“ Drivers are motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” it means in a city planning document .	-3.6293
Some traffic planners ask whether the whole talk of pay per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-4.9396
In the Metropolitan Transport Commission for San Francisco Bay , officials said that Congress could resolve the problem of a bankrupt Highway Trust simply by increasing fuel tax .	-3.9267
An additional one-off charge or an annual levy could be imposed on motorcyclists with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol , so that they too pay a fair share .	-6.0721
“ There is no reason for an operation when an Aspirin is enough , ” he explains Randy Langlaur , the head of Commission legislation and public affairs .	-6.3918
If we do that , hundreds of millions of road-users will worry about their privacy and many other things .	-3.7570
Königsfeld : Small Team beats up on the sidelines .	-9.1505
Voluntary fire brigades carried out their autumn main test , despite staff shortages with flying .	-5.6474
Only eleven men participated in the exercise .	-3.0510
Hans Kammerer graduated from the School of Applied Sciences in Burgberger Street .	-5.9147
A short circuit is to be created at the saw .	-3.9599
Two people were injured by the rise of fire and smoking , but one of them was still a wake-up call .	-3.8374
After the first examination of the facts by Hans Kamer , two military officers were prepared to enter the building .	-4.3533
After a short period of time it was possible to find the first person and go out to the .	-5.0003
The second person had to be borne .	-1.3341
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.1024
The building , a workshop with integrated stall for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.1126
It stored a lot of wood and also a lot of straw balls in it .	-4.4422
Furthermore there were still electrical machines for wood processing .	-2.7922
The first deleterious attack was carried on the tank in the vehicle .	-3.3919
A further rule was carried over a flood of Hydranth in about 100 meters distance .	-6.6086
There have now been three deletion attacks .	-3.1569
A hollow tube was also used in the building .	-2.6740
Hans Kamer also attended the exercise to show what is to be done with less available staff .	-5.8827
In the worst case , support is being provided via the royal field of day-to-day operations .	-6.3411
The commander was satisfied with the end of the exercise .	-2.3543
Internetworking of universities and companies important	-3.1655
During his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwald district president Guido Wolf could also find out about where the workers of tomorrow come from .	-4.8547
In the High Black Forest support centre , he went on to this important issue together with the leading school directors of the School of Appeals , the Grammar School and the parent committee chairs .	-7.6513
" Education is an important location " , supported by Claudia Brelle , director of the Hans-Thoma school , who presented the networked school project of the High Black Forest Educational Centre .	-5.5896
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-3.0092
Since 2011 , there has been a successful cooperation between the Centre for Applied Sciences , the district academy and the vocational school centre .	-7.7621
The hotel also praised the family-friendly atmosphere .	-4.5846
" It is important not only to look at the family stage , but also because of demographic change the stage for caring for relatives " , Wolf explained .	-4.2866
In addition , he said that more and more employees were care and care for their relatives .	-4.9862
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can cause an end to their working relationship , " Wolf said .	-4.1544
But no one can afford to lose qualified workers , he continued .	-2.6625
Another important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-3.0650
" After all , who had already met the region ’ s merits during his studies , his acquired knowledge and skills often remain the regional economy , contributing to the region ’ s empowerment , " the president of the country was convinced .	-8.3606
Only if there were enough training places available could we meet the requirements of the company .	-6.0947
In his opinion , the district 's location advantage is its favourable location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.8209
He also experienced the efforts already made to expand local public passenger transport on his railway route from Titisee Neustadt to Freiburg .	-5.5157
" Stay stubbornly and ensure that public transport is better , " he explained to the address of local politicians present .	-4.5667
Experience Music An entertaining afternoon	-3.0763
For 15 years , the Kaul family has been inviting the seniors to coffee , cake and afterwards to a vesicle .	-6.0052
Previously , the elderly were led to the settlement .	-4.4351
In the meantime , St. Josef takes place this afternoon in the carehome .	-4.9295
The locals enjoyed the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.2127
Later , we had sausage sales .	-5.2347
With popular melodies , Silvia kimi Bantle and her father Karl Kimmish maintained her .	-6.4796
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as a precursor of the old school yard to the Kirchstraße will once again be placed on the Bräningen healing cost plan .	-7.8260
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angle wall was built during the first work on the reconstruction of the front school yard , for stabilisation and static discharge of the over a century old rocky wall with Balustrade .	-7.2828
Alexander Misok , then known as Alexander Misok from the Vernlinger Stadtbauamt , was able to include the State Department of Monument in the planning and draw up a reorganization concept for the old wall .	-9.7751
A calculation of costs will then be carried out by specialists who will then be put on the table to the Council of the Council for deciding and deciding on how to proceed .	-8.5090
A decision on this is expected to come into force as early as next year .	-3.8066
Following the renovation , pavement and construction of the old school inside the two side wings of the villa in 1912 , the school must , in the foreseeable future , be regarded as a follow-up measure to the restoration wall and to new under-construction .	-9.0704
The historical , hundred years old , borderline wall of the old school to the Kirchstraße , is mainly due to water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , needs regeneration and has an arctic bias forward .	-6.9237
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently in jeopardy .	-3.6360
A fixed wall is required for one of the students to use school yard , which has been completed by the current set-up .	-7.2804
Originally the school school school auction was planned even in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high irregular expenditure caused a postponement .	-5.4989
An important word at the historical school page , which has even been used for film pictures , is also mentioned in the Land Account .	-7.4626
In case of guidelines from this site , the city of Branlingen hopes on grants from the city 's monuments protection companies .	-6.6482
The pupils of the permanent primary school , who are now being taught in a well-preserved old school building with new Aula , can soon use the old school courtyard .	-7.3886
Özemir wants to receive Jazztraining in Stuttgart	-4.0656
In the ongoing discussions on the future of music colleges in Baden-Wurttemberg , Cem Özdemor , the Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now taken on .	-5.9172
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic education in the Stuttgart University of Music , " said Özdemar at the Stuttgart News .	-4.9734
Jazz and classical are just part of the Jazzplace Stuttgart .	-3.4211
Thus , Özemir , who is in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate to the German parliamentary election on 22 September , is contradicted by the Green Red State Government .	-7.1279
On the basis of an expert study , it reinforces a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Wurttemberg .	-4.5974
From the University of Music in Stuttgart the course of study is to be shifted to the music universities of Mannheim , among other things .	-7.0722
US border : " super tunnel " to drug smuggling .	-3.1631
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and shut down a ' super tunnel ' for drug smuggling .	-2.8121
As the US customs authorities said , more than 500 metres of tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , rail tracks , and a ventilation system .	-4.1474
Three suspects were then arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized .	-1.8365
According to the information , the tunnel had not yet been used .	-3.9892
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could be digging apart under a radar , " said the Chief Prosecutor of the US District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in San Diego , where an end to the tunnel was discovered .	-8.6391
Duffy insured to drug gangs : " If your further building of such tunnels and tries to use them , we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-5.6579
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in permanent war against drugs .	-3.1517
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime .	-2.1237
Designed by Experts	-2.2863
The investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers , because of the complex equipment of the tunnel , and that the construction took place around a year .	-5.5892
The location of the hotel was very good .	-7.2880
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building 80 meters from the border .	-3.7944
A ladder of 20 meters of depth leads to the real tunnel swing .	-4.6694
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimetres width .	-2.1883
It would have been able to promote illegal immigration to the United States .	-3.4541
Two of the suspects were arrested and detained in connection with the cocaine programme .	-3.1783
Third , an Mexicans , was caught because of the confiscated Marihuanas .	-4.1273
All three are threatened with imprisonment for maximum life imprisonment , as officials have said .	-4.6580
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-3.1659
It is , however , the first time that such tunnel building cocaine was found .	-3.8344
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .	-2.5608
This is showing the " desperation " of drug gangs whose traditional routes have since been cut off , Bill Sherman said of the drug ban DEA in San Diego .	-6.0350
They would do everything to get to the US .	-1.9310
No details were given to those arrested , at least one of them was Mexican .	-4.4454
They have to face sentences of up to ten years .	-3.2130
In 2014 , Geisinger ’ s Fest-Year	-1.9003
The anniversary of the city Geising during the 1250 .	-4.0776
A reversal of the first formal reference is coming ever closer .	-3.7338
When the year ends in just eight weeks , the anniversary is over .	-4.5606
Geising and church houses were first mentioned in 794 by tradition .	-5.5879
A certificate was made in churches where both places are mentioned .	-4.4702
On the 15th of March there will be an official start for the jubilee year , and as violets do not currently have a hall , the event will take place in the place where both the first mention was made about 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-8.7894
A number of events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church houses .	-3.9238
In July , church houses were built in 1250 at a festival weekend of 18 to 20 July .	-5.7791
Let us celebrate returning .	-2.5924
On Friday with a fixed act , on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall .	-3.8657
In addition , the church house celebrations are held at this festival .	-5.5341
The city ’ s music director Rudolf Bart wrote a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is listed at three .	-5.8325
On June 21 , together with the Sunday party of the Black Forest Association , on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 , the first Concert of City Music in the new Festhalle .	-5.6431
This will be completed and inaugurated in the year of the anniversary , the official date will be on the last September weekend , 27 and 28 September .	-6.5307
A new chronicle is still being published on the occasion of the Geisinger ´ s anniversary .	-4.6516
" But it is to become a chronicle not only by Geisingen himself , but by a printed work on the violation of today , which is made of violins , halls , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmapdingen , " says Walter Hengstler .	-9.7403
And today ’ s violation of 2014 birthday , 1974 ’ s contemporary interior was completed with the opinions .	-7.1491
The new chronicle will be presented at the new festival hall in Geising on November 21 or 22 .	-3.9223
2014 , however , is another year with many anniversary .	-2.6908
The Narure of Strohglonki starts on 8 February with a custom evening during its 60-year-old existence , the harmony Gutmandingen takes 90 years and has the ceremonial stage on 29 March and then , from 1 to 4 May , celebrates the district music festival .	-8.1144
The Altenwerk Leipzig erdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger school has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10 , the Musikverein Polyhymia Leipzig erdingen is 150 years old and is celebrating this within the framework of the Brunnen festival from July 4th to July 7th .	-6.7648
The town of singing was first mentioned in 764 in a gift gift certificate , which is owned by the St. Gallen Monastery .	-5.3759
The document was made in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court place .	-3.7932
So both communities are mentioned in the same document .	-2.2739
Celebrating this 1250-year anniversary in 2014 , the municipal reform is also back 40 years .	-5.5757
The Council is targeting forest fires	-3.9517
Should the transfer to the railway station " Am Hirschen " be extensively rebuilt to improve road safety ?	-4.3657
Yes , the municipal councils have decided .	-3.0539
Schiltach has to take EUR 220 000 in hand .	-5.0127
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the heath line next year .	-10.1292
The aim of this is to increase the safety of railway inputs - regularly it is to collisions of trains with other vehicles across Germany .	-8.2633
If the communities vote to move , they must incur a third of the costs , the rest share the railways and the federation .	-7.8465
The town hall of Roland Grißmann explained to the Council the specific characteristics of the Bahoverflow " Am Hirschen " .	-7.7204
There the city plans to build out of the railway tracks in the height of the tunnel curtain there .	-6.8705
There , even larger vehicles , such as those that carry longwood transport , could stand in the opposite direction without blocking the rails .	-7.5675
Greek holders therefore proposed to construct a required supporting wall in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent street in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-5.6470
This was a controversial discussion in the Municipal Council , because some Councils questioned the need for greater road expansion : Thomas Kipp put the mood of critics on the point : ' Do we need to take so much money for so few cars ? '	-7.5096
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : the " Hirschen " rail transfer is used regularly for long timber .	-4.8602
Even wood from the " Kuckbach " area is transported partly via this route , because the up to 20 meters of vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbridge because they could not turn to the main road .	-6.4943
Moreover , the route serves as a guide for those vehicles that may not use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.7090
It is worth noting that Kirchberg and the castle tunnel have to be rebuilt and refurbished , as is currently the case in Wolfach , that the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " can also provide an important means of transport for a longer period of time .	-7.7793
The Councils agreed to investigate the costs of the one-way connection of the street .	-5.1940
In spite of this , most of the changes in the railway have been agreed with the provision that the required base wall will be built in such a way that the city could expand the following road towards " Bahnhofstraße " , possibly for connection traffic to around 5.5 m .	-10.0831
The reconstruction of the rail crossing in the rubble wine could , however , lead to a very different problem affecting the distance to the heavily increasing " Geroltzhaus Path " .	-10.2011
The administration had had to examine the reconstruction plans of the train from the engineers office Schwenlinger , because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroldhaus Weg was still possible .	-8.2799
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not to be excluded that the streetcar ’ s leanings could lead to longer cars sitting .	-6.4491
The responsibility for this is borne by the city as a vehicle builder .	-4.0037
The conversion could therefore entail liability disputes .	-4.3361
Because both logging and turning were working in the current state of construction , one should not agree to re-building of the railway , Haas argued .	-6.5658
Even at this point , the risk of a collision of turn with a shift vehicle is far lower than the other routes , because the center is located right next to where there is a good line of sight .	-8.0622
Even trains from the main railway station should have been delayed so far that there is no risk of a collision .	-5.5958
The Council of Ministers refused to agree to the reconstruction of this rail crossing , as the city of Schicontach would have to bear the problem with loading vehicles " , as the trains can withdraw from the responsibility after the construction works have been completed .	-9.6785
As unproblematic , the board considers the transition to the railway tracks " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuckbach " for which cross agreements have already been met with the railway .	-6.4513
Esa decides on large-scale space missions : missions for billions	-2.9804
Remote planets , gravitational waves or black holes - European Space Agency experts now have to agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years .	-4.5425
30 proposals were for selection , five are still in the race .	-3.1156
Remote worlds .	-2.6335
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.6146
Whether there are at least some of these lives , nobody knows .	-3.3269
The selection is hard : to search for gravitational waves ?	-3.5999
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-1.8840
Or on earth similar planets , perhaps on extra-terrestrial life ?	-4.3347
These are the issues that are precisely the responsibility of the European Space Agency Esa .	-3.8956
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are going to make research progress .	-5.6902
The budget for such ' L missions ' is about EUR 1 billion each .	-2.5964
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-2.0926
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-1.8742
30 ideas have been on the debate , five of them have now come to the polls .	-4.6131
Many bodies examine the proposals , hack into the research .	-3.7749
A final decision will be taken over the next few days by the Scientific Committee .	-3.2698
All four big questions have been selected by Esa , to which the missions of the 2007 initiated programme " Cosmic Vision " are to be found .	-5.1533
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life ?	-2.7226
The exact events in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets around them - are still in the proverbial darkness .	-5.6122
A large infrared telescope in the All could penetrate this darkness .	-3.6542
And if a star has a planet in which circumstances can life arise ?	-3.2516
To deal with this issue , the space telescope is to launch “ Cheops ” in 2017 , with the more detailed investigation of the 500 known planetary systems in our immediate surroundings .	-6.6694
The possibilities are limited , though , shops are a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.3081
With larger instruments , astronomers could shape a similar planet , analyzing the composition of their atmosphere and thus search for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered to be indigenous to biological activity .	-5.8856
How does the solar system work ?	-1.3539
This question , too , will ultimately determine the conditions for the creation of life .	-4.6922
A key role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation resulting from it with the planet system .	-5.7262
In our solar system these processes can be investigated in an exemplary way .	-3.9077
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already granted a M Class mission ( where the budget is at around EUR 1 billion ) for this issue .	-5.5217
The probe will start 2017 and watch the Sun ’ s surface and activity closely .	-4.4994
Of great interest to researchers are also Jupiterimages and their Monde .	-3.8299
You want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-3.8593
The Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme .	-3.8086
The Sonde " juice " ( Jupirer Icons Explorer ) is starting their journey in 2022 .	-4.3580
In eight years later , it reaches Jupiter and will examine the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europe , Kallisto and Ganymmed .	-7.1105
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe ?	-1.0107
The world of all offers many opportunities to study subject matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws that we know are still valid there .	-6.7867
Perhaps deviations that could lead the physics to a new theory can also be found under which all known laws of nature could be combined .	-6.5317
What happened to the universe and what does it consist of ?	-2.9887
Our cosmos was created by our brand in 13.7 billion years ago .	-4.2003
In addition to the material used to us , consisting of stars , planets and creatures like us , there are dark-matter whose gravity galaxies and galaxy clusters are combined , and Dark Energy , which accelerates the expansion of the space .	-8.1356
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the big bang , nor do they know of the dark matter and the dark energy .	-6.3200
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved a M mission for 2020 .	-4.2207
With a special telescope , the probe is intended to examine the distribution of matter in the universe for the first time in the whole sky , thus enabling conclusions on the nature of Dunkeller 's matter and Dunkeller 's energy .	-7.0902
Who could race	-3.4533
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.9414
In the opinion of many experts , " E-Lisa " , the best chances for a grant as a L-mission have been to prove gravitational waves .	-5.4956
Among them , physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-3.6249
Up to now , they have not been re-.	-3.8831
Elisa could do that , hoping scientists behind the project .	-3.8094
The mission consists of two or three of the existing detector that is placed in the space .	-5.4619
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also prove gravitational waves generated by the big bang , providing new evidence of the origins of the cosmos .	-6.4549
Four further proposals still compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is supposed to explore black holes , " Icy planets " , a further mission to the outer planet of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the spatial radiation of cosmic background radiation , and the " Explanet Finder " , which is intended to scan and study the similar planet .	-7.6199
Some proposals for a test return transport from Mars are already available , for research on Moon , Venus and Asteriids as well as solar physics .	-8.3139
Snowden agreed to “ cooperate with Germany on US surveillance . ”	-2.2909
Edward Snowden , the Whistleblover of the US secret service , has declared that he is ready to travel to Berlin and say to the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers to their activities .	-5.5593
The German MEP , Hans-Christian Strobel , met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where this asylum was granted to discuss Germany ’ s statement .	-4.7576
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , he writes : “ Although the result of my efforts has been shown positive , my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a trustee and attempts to criminalise political expression with threat of penalties , where no defence is possible . ”	-7.1840
But saying the truth is not a crime .	-1.8515
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charge .	-4.5180
The charges raised by the US Department of Justice include espionage and theft of state property .	-2.7505
The German Minister for the Interior , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said online : “ If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives , we will find ways to make that possible . ”	-4.5412
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA heard German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-4.3257
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that one should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if this is possible , “ without threatening him and destroying relations with the US completely . ”	-5.7923
Strughet , a member of the Greens , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter shop .	-5.1456
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.4364
Strugh explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA member , Snowden could not return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-3.5370
If Snowden was telling Germany , he would need a reassurance that he was “ safe ” there , the honourable Member said .	-4.3831
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that forced him from his home country .	-4.1583
It is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political opinion . ”	-2.9672
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance to the general public .	-4.2637
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation , “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation were resolved . ”	-4.1108
Frontier Airlines charges for cabin baggage	-2.0343
Frontier Airlines plans to demand US $ 100 from passengers who wish to dive on their flight .	-3.3880
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of handbaggage and $ 2 for coffee or Limonade , even if it was announced on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole dosage .	-4.7769
The new charge applies to hand luggage in a luggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free of charge .	-3.7862
Frontier explained that you calculated $ 25 when the charge is paid in advance , and USD 100 for travelers who only paid on the platform .	-5.6471
Front speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the $ 100 fee will move travelers to pay in advance .	-4.8770
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this amount , ” she explained .	-2.7970
Airlines began to demand charges for the first and second piece of baggage issued in 2008 .	-3.2934
As a result , passengers who tried to bypass them have thrown them into hand baggage as much as possible , which means that the bags are often crowded above the seat .	-7.0682
Fees are one way to move passengers to less on board .	-2.7395
O 'Malley said that at the new cost , it is not really a question of earning money .	-3.5238
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier , who have clearly said that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space on the premises above the seat .	-6.0653
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-4.4266
This means that a passenger may take a piece of baggage free of charge on the platform from frontier , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-5.5496
O 'Malley explained that the site of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed , so that passengers are informed of the charges before they come to the platform .	-5.2593
Fronter 's new hand baggage charge will only appear in the summer , an exact date is not yet available .	-6.8836
Passengers often fly through luggage allowances and other charges , but airlines are happy to pay back .	-6.2460
They argue that transporting the luggage should cost money and passenger pay this service if they wish .	-3.5173
Many on Wall Street see new luggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years .	-9.1488
Most of them have so far left the keys of handbaggage charges .	-5.1887
Spirit Airlines was first placed in charge of manual baggage three years ago , followed by Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-5.2004
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , explained by the airline advisor Jay Sorensen to pay close attention to the additional charges .	-4.6955
In a report of December 2011 , he estimated that the handbaggage charge Spirit brings USD 50 million a year .	-4.9740
Sorensen , who formerly has a leading position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown Spirit and was curious what would expect him on a platform if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage charge .	-7.1354
“ The Board process was one of the most volatile I have experienced in my course of business in aviation , ” he said .	-5.4331
I expected to see counter and hand hand hand hand hand discuss on the platform .	-6.1856
“ The aircraft was full , ” he said , “ and boarding was shrinking . ”	-3.2964
Frontier also follows the two dollars required for coffee , tea , Limonade or juice .	-2.6335
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or juice should keep all the cans and get coffee for free .	-4.4177
Water remains free of charge .	-1.3764
US Airways attempted to charge soft drinks in 2008 , but it reversed seven months later after passengers complained and no other major society had taken up .	-6.4882
Fronters move to charge handling fees if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-5.4533
Airlines pay online travel agencies , such as Orbitz , pay 10 to 25 dollars per sold ticket .	-4.3126
This gives all societies an incentive to move passengers to purchase them directly , rather than via an online travel agency .	-4.9761
Frontier , however , made the most progress in this area .	-2.7750
In September the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.7945
On Wednesday , Miles were cut back to 25 % of the airline ’ s track .	-3.3356
For this reason , passengers travelling with a third party with a front passenger more than 1000 miles will earn only 250 miles .	-5.5852
Passengers can also book online only when they purchase the site from Front Desk .	-5.4468
Frontier has a loyal customer base on its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company lost money .	-3.7397
The revenue fell by 9 percent and the flight capacity contracted nearly 13 % in the first quarter , as in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-7.3976
Republic has tried to get Frontier ’ s finances under the sale of society .	-3.9871
Talk of the Bible	-0.8104
Well 40 women attended the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the Protestant church of Bisingen .	-3.3172
The theme of the day in the Municipal House was ' talking words from the Bible ' and ' speaking applications from the Middle Ages ' .	-7.5407
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the church council , entered into a lecture on the biblical saying after the breakfast .	-4.7397
They explained , saying , saying , saying , according to heaven 's wisdom , rules , or warnings .	-6.9272
They compared several sayings with the corresponding biases and declared the importance .	-5.2348
They called sayings like : wood watching how scouts fall from the eyes is an eye on someone who gives his parents ' sleep and washing his hands in vain .	-9.7917
The memorial also visited its listeners , and the saying was one of them .	-6.4709
The songs from the Middle Ages were made by the people of the church in Christine Dehner : All good things are three , blue , smashed .	-8.1427
She explained the significance and origin of the phrase she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-3.3794
To conclude , a Tombola was established .	-3.6031
The prices were quoted on a table and were oddly wrapped just before they were handed over to the winner .	-6.1028
Under the visitor ’ s breakfast round , Roman Waizenegger also misted the Mayor ’ s mother tongue .	-7.5769
Learning instead of unemployed : A pilot project for Unlearned Tourism	-6.3429
Today , a pilot project for the tourism industry started on the Mecklein Lake District .	-3.7490
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as an unexperienced in the industry are to be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winter .	-6.3907
" The new thing is that the six-month courses with qualifications " , Carmen Wiechert said by the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency .	-4.1740
The benefits are varied : the participants would not be unemployed , the firms would get skilled professionals who were increasingly absent in hotels and restaurants , and the agency should not finance unemployment .	-6.3984
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel and Gaststätten ( Dega ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-4.8991
NSA declares that a “ internal error ” and not hackers are responsible for the crash of the website .	-3.7520
The shadowy National Security Agency announced on late Friday that a mistake failed its public website for a few hours and not hackers , as online has been claimed .	-4.9217
“ NSAZgov was not available for a few hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency reported in an e-mail sent .	-6.7841
The problem is fixed this evening .	-2.1385
The claim that failure has been caused by a spread Denial of Service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-4.0341
In the early evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours , and this is still not available for some users .	-4.9115
A speaker from the NSA before ABC News said that the sensitive internal network of the authority is “ in no way ” compromised .	-4.4266
mysterious information is not in danger , as the spokesman said .	-3.8437
At least one group of hacking used to paralyze the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.7873
In case of such attacks , the target website is invoked with side panels until the server is overloaded and the site collapses .	-4.3358
The cyber tactic is relatively simple and does not serve to penetrate into the internal network of the target system .	-3.6283
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname was No Search Agency ( no such authority ) , is now seen in the bright light of the public and is exposed to widespread criticism of its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disenchanted former NSA staff Edward Snowden .	-11.1434
The growing controversy over secret service controlled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyop operation .	-4.7297
In October , the number of people without a job fell by 22 to 1.7 .	-4.6570
Although quota of 3.1 % was better than last year and also better than in September , " we would have hoped for more , " Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen , says .	-4.7432
Many companies have responded to attitudes so far .	-3.0283
According to fielder Bauer , this is a reason : " We have few skilled workers in the craft , in the health care and in care of the elderly " .	-6.8944
Since September there are also job opportunities for hotel and catering professionals .	-6.1461
The winter season starts in mid-December .	-2.2766

Deaths by Bombardier following a decline in delivery and procurement	-8.1476
On Thursday , Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % reduction in net profit after having been put under pressure due to lower orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter , as well as contract problems in rail saving .	-6.8550
Bombardier , based in Montreal , did not publish air test data for its brand new plane of CSeries and did not give any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable of next September .	-5.8217
The maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago followed only three more starts , which makes it doubtful whether the test phase is as planned .	-6.4413
The results remained short of the projections , leading to a fall of more than 8 % on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-4.6227
Cameron Dodgersen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his rating on “ outperform ” to “ sector performance ” on Thursday , with a view to ensuring that the shares have a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-6.5009
“ Although weaker delivery figures were expected in aircraft as far as possible , we are clearly disappointed by the transport margin development , ” said Doderksen in a customer letter .	-6.2329
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSFs when the aircraft is moving forward .	-3.9891
If , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-3.2133
Bombardier hopes that the CSFs ’ aircraft series can feed the company into the lower market segment that is now dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-3.6696
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay .	-2.9593
But binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are currently moderate , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims for fuel efficiency and cost saving potential of the new jet aircraft are true .	-6.7782
Currently there are 403 orders and pledges of 15 customers and companies .	-2.5916
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-3.7904
Our company management also secured a commitment to analysts and the media on Thursday , the program was in the timetable .	-7.1450
“ The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected , ” said Beaudobin at a telephone conference and added , while the aircraft ’ s standing time had been subject to soil tests and software updates .	-6.2007
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.2347
We have decided to make a first flight and then to place a transitional period on what we have done .	-4.4789
This is happening throughout the entire programme of flights .	-2.5482
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining short after that was said by the company side .	-5.7605
However , analysts remain sceptical as to whether twelve months after the Young Flight the first customer can take up a plane of the CSdium .	-5.3520
Bombardier explained that it will review the planning for start-up ( EIS ) and will update it over the coming months .	-4.2013
“ The flight test ’ s slow progress – even if they clearly match bombings of internal planning – confirms our view that the start-up will move to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Dodgersen .	-6.4335
In the third quarter , with the end of September 30 , bombings were net profit at $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of 172 million , respectively 9 cents per share in the previous year .	-4.5482
The adjusted earnings per share is 9 cents unchanged .	-3.5409
Sales decreased slightly from 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.1638
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a sales of $ 4,56 billion , so Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.9020
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 in the last year .	-4.0656
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.4784
The order book in the air and space saving was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September , and thus remained unchanged on 31 December .	-8.5280
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were disappointing in our requirements , but the low order intake and market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudobn .	-5.3882
Sales in the aerospace industry fell by 13 % to two billion dollars .	-2.8610
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest rail manufacturer , announced that revenues in that saving have risen by nearly 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-4.4342
The order book in the transport savings was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September , and was thus easily increased from 31 December .	-5.3378
The profit range in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.6368
According to company management , new requirements will be met for the fourth quarter .	-3.6023
In the light trade on Thursday , the bombing share was 8.5 % , and it was 4,83 Canadian dollars after it was announced that the Google Financial Board will change Patrick Pichette to the Board .	-8.0276
On Thursday , the Brazilian Embassy SA , the world 's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and the Bombardier Rivale reported a 10 % decline in quarterly profit .	-5.3981

Kokaine ’ s lawyer , warning of drug traffickers against police investigation , must be imprisoned .	-4.5679
Basharat Dietta , 42 , gave information to subworld Neil Scarborough .	-3.9439
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence might come to light .	-3.1380
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-2.3699
A well-known person who has warned a drug barons against a major police investigation , because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .	-6.4621
Basharat Dietta , 42 , provided subworld space Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on its activities in drug trafficking after compromising through his own cohort .	-6.1489
Criminalists were arrested in his house in 2011 , when the police had been surveillance of Scarborough in a former drug practice .	-7.1469
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while at a meal of lawyers .	-6.0627
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly uses class A drugs after finding traces of cocaine in his hair , on his wallet and credit cards .	-4.8965
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he attempted to obtain unauthorized information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.9962
At that time , all four suspects were monitored by the police under a major investigation procedure for the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-5.6235
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after police secured heroin and cocaine worth <unk> 1.5 million and <unk> 200,000 pounds in cash on a number of home searches .	-6.4628
Dietta , 42 , gave information to the criminals , because he was afraid that his drug addiction could be known .	-4.2660
Dietta , who worked for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstruction of justice .	-5.4068
In a previous survey , he gave possession of cocaine .	-3.4917
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in her investigation against Scarborough that in February 2011 , it had been in regular telephone contact with Dietta .	-5.0663
Two investigation officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas ’ s house and then put drugs with an purview of 60 % in a black golf shoe under the rubbish feet of the lawyer .	-6.7103
Shortly after he had sent the drugs , Scarborough was regularly telephony with Ditta , who was located at the Black burn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-6.4986
The lawyer returned home , drugs took off and nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-3.3428
Before the court , Ditta was known as a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after a Class A tests were discovered in his hair , his wallet and his credit cards .	-7.3276
Dietta was arrested later , but disputed to take cocaine and said that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that his discussion was “ legal secrets . ”	-6.7577
During his arrest Ditta took his letterbag and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were assured and a hair sample was taken from him .	-5.0612
In the case of police interrogation he said he would run an office and client at home for legal matters , both in his private address and in the workplace .	-6.1132
Before the court , it was known that he had called for important drug trafficking players , some of whom he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed about what investigators knew about them .	-7.0996
Citizenship Anne Who said : “ A criminal law lawyer should know better than everyone else that law is not breaking . ”	-4.5796
Dietta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , as he has become too involved with certain clients .	-4.4727
The questionable relationship is not just a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.5870
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-4.0323
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.3078
He looked at the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-3.8617
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute .	-2.5836
He was too close to certain clients , particularly Mr Scarborough , and allowed his independence to be compromised .	-3.9465
Dietta had any misbehavior by himself and claimed that “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , what I was not , and wanted to pass information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-6.3032
But after the hearing , super-intendent Lee Halstead said by the police in Lancashire : “ Mr. Ditta did the move from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he started buying drugs from organized criminals . ”	-6.0015
His cohort was a hopeful compromise and made it receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-5.1390
Lawyers need to maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence .	-2.6599
Dietta has lost that trust and tried to forge behind the façade of his profession .	-4.7795
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Dietta , which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-6.5224
This case should be criminals a warning and shows that nobody can escape the law 's arm .	-4.6766
We will find you and bring you to court .	-2.0661
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of conspiracy Heroin , Kokaini and Potassium Trading .	-6.1842
Twenty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were condemned to a total of 153 years for drug abuse .	-4.4932
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , in which he prefers to represent his dream job as a lawyer on death row in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali , and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-6.8730
Revolutionary work of church music	-2.0996
At the end of the 160-year celebrations , the Liederkraz Dunningen will outline two religious services with the " German Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-5.7228
After the great success of the musicals " Rock my Life " , which took place in the spring of this year , the Liederkraz will enrich two religious services at the end of the jubilee year with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert .	-6.5371
On Saturday 26 October , this extraordinary fair will be heard at the St. Martin-Church of Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 October , from 10.15 p.m. at the St. John Baptiskirche in Lacendorf .	-6.1531

Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the group of the Rohsense Tennenronn music group and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-4.5400
Haslach : Skepticism By By By	-8.0984
The 2015 general election of the parish council will , for example , change the basics of Haslach ( SE ) .	-4.5588
Then there is only one common parish to all six parish departments .	-5.6631
In a joint meeting on Saturday the forums from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlbach , Fischbach , Steinbach and Welchenstein prepared for the changes .	-4.4204
After all , the fundamental decisions taken in the Diocese are nothing more to change and it is up to the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-7.8114
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear that scepticism about the New Zealand is gradually tending to become more confident .	-6.3754
From the ideas and expectations of the new proposals in 2015 to specific proposals on the future composition and the size of the general public body , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main bodies of the maritime safety team were expressed .	-7.2868
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt , according to a presentation , described the new directives for seafarers ' compensation in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .	-4.4696
Then the SE Haslach will be a parish of public law that enters into the rights and duties of the six different communities of the church so far .	-6.0751
There will only be a common parish council and a board of foundation in which the parish authority is represented .	-4.5801
The aim of each parish is to have at least two elected members . In the six parish teams are formed on the ground .	-6.2143
Their task will in future be to promote the Church ’ s life in the place .	-7.0919
When it comes to the finances of the individual parish , a great deal of discussion was then needed .	-5.1746
The new developments show that collected funds are maintained in the parish agencies .	-4.8153
The liabilities refer to the entire community .	-3.1533
In particular , with regard to the large planned investment , the commitment of which all the parish departments meet , there were major concerns .	-7.1972
" In the past , it was invested only in projects that could be dealt with by the different departments alone " , translated into relative Haswa 's general secretary , Bruno Prinzbach .	-7.5119
Practical experience with a common body for five parish halls laid bare barbar knights , the chair of the body in the body ’ s caressiness , Schutter Forest Neusqu.	-7.8302
They had been doing their job in 2006 , ' One , five will remain ' and they had to find that it is not so easy .	-7.4156
The bodies of the Haslaver crew then went to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-6.3095
Drafting will be further developed and decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.9032
At the end of the parish , Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new image of the vailing body , which was approved by a clear majority .	-5.5150
In Pfulendorf , the electricity will become more expensive .	-2.3409
The citizens of Pfulendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-3.2570
Like the director of the townworks , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , the arrival of a four-headed Pfuldorfer family is 70 to 90 euros more per year .	-6.9500
The significant reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG shift from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.1054
This adjustment is set each October by the four operators of the large electricity grid .	-4.8049
These figures indicate the additional costs that they incur from the energy transformation that they can incur by switching over the electricity price .	-6.3287
The town works Pfulendorf form the last link in this chain .	-3.5862
In its forecasts , the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even assumed a higher standard , as Jörs-Arne Bias reports .	-5.2608
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-4.1915
" We are moving from 1 cent plus x " , " said Bias , where the number will be close to 2 cents .	-5.3294
Traffic lights on permanent red : At wait wait .	-4.8284
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not become green .	-2.1067
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-2.1633
What if you want to do , go to Red ?	-4.4668
If a competitor has waited long enough at a red light and the cross is free , he can go on , explains the Stuttgart Manager Ralf Becker in the " motorcycle " magazine .	-5.3414
But the waiting time must be reasonable , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-4.2557
Becker advised that at least five minutes should be passed before starting from a function disorder of the traffic light .	-4.7653
Anyone who continues the journey despite red light must be aware , however , that it is fully responsible for an accident that is caused .	-6.5941
Those who accept less than five minutes may not wait long enough , Becker warns and points to a decision by the Supreme Court Hamm .	-3.3741
In this case , after about three minutes of continuous red , a driver ignored the traffic lights and had to be responsible for a careless red light .	-7.1346
In fact , the traffic lights were not broken , but rather jumped to green a little later .	-5.1458
A ban on driving him was spared because of the special situation - but not the fine .	-5.9413
The Council of municipalities is pleased about a solid budget	-3.9891
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laugh well .	-3.3372
The Municipal seat in Herdwanen-Schönach is well filled and debt has no longer been familiar with the administration since 2005 .	-6.2850
The 2012 financial year can also be regarded as full success in this sense .	-2.3733
This became clear when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .	-3.4190
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was over EUR 1 million more than planned .	-5.1137
The surplus of the administrative budget is also EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-3.8612
Above all , the surplus is due to higher commercial tax revenue and the community share of income tax .	-4.9901
The wealth budget , too , was clearly above the intended values .	-4.4771
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.1035
" This is essentially due to the higher administrative gain , " said Rotmund .	-5.5380
Since less investment was made in the 2012 financial year than was planned , the return rate is higher .	-4.9520
Overall , the overall reserve of around EUR 2.1 million has been increased to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-3.3444
Mayor Ralph Gerster wrote for his good work with Rothmund and her team .	-4.3264
" This is a work you don 't just throw out of your sleeves " , praised Gerster with a view to the annual accounts .	-5.6135
He and the municipal councils were obviously happy with the good figures .	-3.3172
It may sound paradoxical , but these good figures could soon cost the citizens dearly .	-3.3636
Thanks to the good financial situation , the community had been able to dispense with high interest rates in the past .	-5.4707
According to Gerster , however , aid from the country has already been reduced .	-4.8927
The conditions for these interventions from various compensation surveys are there .	-5.3806
Among other things , the cities and communities applying for grants must have certain classes .	-4.9590
" We have to look at the subject of studies , because investment is up in the coming years , for which we would like to have subsidies , " said Gerster in this context .	-6.7092
Nagold : Hugo Wermian-born in the choir for 60 years .	-3.8262

After 60 years , the singing with which now seems more like a favorite choir still makes him even more fun .	-7.7136
The association has also been a member of the committee for 28 years .	-3.8569
He has received several awards for his commitment and association : Jörg Kohler , Pastoralreferent , on behalf of the Cäcillienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , handed over to him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the Association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhardt .	-7.1474

According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu describes a psychological phenomenon that is expressed in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation .	-5.7063
In case of the visit of the café on the Ophse in the county town of Kleve in sight of the Rhine Waal University , it must not remain the pure sense of déjà Vu .	-7.2406
After all , the café , with its beautiful name , has precisely the aim : to make a real stay not only memorable , but hand-to-hand experience .	-7.0068
Because 's just fun and easy to use .	-2.6672
An eye on the Oph8 's inner life gives the viewer a good feeling at first sight .	-5.3361

From moving to Kleve to Ophse , the pleasant Café-friendly people hope to have more visitors .	-7.9024
Not least the university .	-3.1101
" What we do not have a specific target group " , says Daniel Büttner .	-3.3767
In fact , the two young students here want to talk just as much as seniors and all age groups between them .	-5.9676
Out of Café-lovers .	-3.8496

Two events were already in the bright café .	-2.6275
The better is to say one .	-3.2857
Because the port festival was rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.9944
But there were also the Ringelnatzabell .	-3.9872
" Great , successful and fun " , the two 33-year-old people found .	-3.5712
But it is not Jedermann ’ s business .	-2.5312
Daniel Büttner may not be a fan of event dinners either : " We can 't do all the right now " .	-6.3057
And with an event I talk only about those who are interested in the special event .	-3.2343
Events will therefore be the exception of our events .	-4.2337
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.4745

UN proclaims new goals for combating poverty	-2.4915
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago .	-4.6504
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro this evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in launching “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals .	-3.5906
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-2.5264
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated at the summit this evening that the time had come to “ think about national interests . ”	-3.8758
“ I am pleased that the member states agreed to embark on a process to agree with universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-4.1055
“ These goals will be built on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals , and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework .	-3.1172
I will spare no efforts in implementing this mandate granted to me by member states in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.1992
Even though the SG Achim / Baden have been without victory for four days , there is still a good atmosphere for hand wall-vaulters .	-6.9040

However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.8089
" Because I no longer know how to taste a victory , " Lemon expects a successful experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-5.1229
Although the Third Party reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet torn trees , Malimon will alert the reader in advance .	-5.6344
Many players have trained me in A-Youth .	-2.9659
That is why they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-2.4000
" It is also important to wait for the first step to be taken , " demonstrates the SG-coach .	-6.2246
In order to finally return to the successful track , the Maltese team must definitely increase as compared to the previous performance .	-5.5098
Above all , in the coverage work and in the play of the game , it finally prevailed enormous .	-7.1583
Equal opportunities must also definitely be better .	-2.8262
So I hope that my players have finally got their heads free during the short break .	-3.9239
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-3.2110
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the State founder and first president of Mozambique , to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace calls .	-4.3568
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , managing director of an investment company .	-2.1562
For fear of the future of the country , she has converted her business clothes against a T-shirt with the slogan “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and connected to the capital on Thursday .	-5.4195
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-3.9464
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the North African Government , and later South Africa ’ s apartheid government , seeking to destabilise the country ’ s independent government .	-4.3315
Following the 1992 Peace Treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.4051
Analysts believe that the country is likely to fall back into a full-scale conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and indigenous people .	-4.0626
The rapidly growing economy is at stake because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring investment of more than 50 billion US companies like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anadko from the US in the coming years .	-6.3673
The ruling Frelimo Party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo are blaming each other for tensions .	-3.5164
Renamo maintains that the government provoked the recent clash by attacking its members in the Sofala province on 17 October , a traditional stronghold of Renamos .	-4.3214
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamoo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakma , the leader of the group , declared Renamos ’ s spokesman for the Financial Times .	-4.8835
The government is blaming Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers .	-2.7581
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-2.5323
On Wednesday , AFP , the French news agency said that Dhlakma views himself as a “ losers , ” who wants to use “ all its remaining forces to prove that he can force the government to decide . ”	-5.7096
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.2250
However , concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words that Renamo is giving up the 1992 peace agreement .	-4.3125
In front of the FT he explained that he meant that Frelimo did not respect the agreement any longer .	-4.2074
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations and , indeed , seriously , ” Mazanga said .	-3.4806
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to the resolution of tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.9290
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakma ) who meet the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.7400
None of them are good in bargaining and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.9519
Renamo , pushing for electoral reforms , has already said that it will boycott the local elections in November .	-3.4404
The presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .	-2.6223
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to intimidate , concessions , and financial benefits from the government .	-3.8049
Renral elections have been shrinking since 1992 , while a recent party , the Moviento Yosemite de Moçítico ( MDM ) , founded by a former Renamoo member , will probably improve in the elections .	-7.7036
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.1199
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” Mazanga says .	-3.4266
It is unclear what Renamo is capable of , but it has engaged in worrying attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south connections .	-4.8649
Most of the fighting took place in the Sofala Province , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but where Beira is located , the port that uses mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-5.3202
In June , Rio broke out for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-3.7466
Mazanga responded with reluctance to ask whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-3.0591
Reno wanted “ the international community warn that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-3.5778
Disinstability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , the slow progress in development and a recent turnaround wave .	-5.1790
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.0778
Omar Sultan , a demonstration , said that people simply wanted stability .	-3.2579
“ Don ’ t be interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and accessible roads , ” he explained .	-4.8580
Children should teach myths and legends as “ images for life ” , says an author .	-3.1220
Thor ’ s stories show that “ brutal power has no chance of clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend shows how important it is to have a dream .	-4.2561
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too objectionable , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crosley Holland argued for “ careful selection ” ancient works .	-5.8608
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-1.6779
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.4780
He added , among authors and teachers who are “ over-didactically , ” that children would “ completely off , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would “ underlie . ”	-6.3771
Crosley Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Mys and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-6.0709
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to give hope .	-3.3811
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil .	-2.4657
This must be an understated , by which history is revealed and not explained .	-5.4852
This is the old story of the pointing , rather than telling .	-2.6304

“ They believe that there is no logic to break the laws of physics and common sense , ” as Crump .	-4.2253

US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation of the death of Johnson , because a number of important questions have yet to be resolved .	-4.0073
What was the cause of death ?	-0.7399
Is his death a crime ?	-1.1489

My goal is to find out the truth .	-1.3926
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.3528
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsies indicate that Johnson was doomed to the consequences of a “ positioned launch . ”	-5.2083

CDC publish Allergeris for schools	-4.0938
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies to children in schools .	-2.9375
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government , as the number of school-age children increases with food allergies .	-3.9355
One of 20 children in the United States now has food allergies .	-1.9292
According to CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-3.4940
The guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions .	-4.4369
It is also recommended that schools epinephrin be pre-exposed – the Auto injection of the Epstone brand is most commonly used – to cope with a potentially deadly over-sensitivity response .	-7.3708
The federal legislators have recently changed the rules so that schools can easily give epinephrin .	-5.1928
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms known by children who have an allergic reaction .	-3.0997
Children may say , “ It feels like putting something on my tongue ” , “ My tongue feels like a hair is on it , ” or “ My tongue performs it . ”	-5.1345
Intersexual children ’ s parents can choose “ gender integrity ” .	-3.1774
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with non-definite genitals .	-3.1045
newborns are no longer fixed at male or female . are .	-5.7047
Under the new law , parents no longer need to declare a gender for such children , but can provide “ unnoticed ” or “ not set ” on birth certificate .	-5.7432
The aim of the law is to put pressure on parents so that they do not have to take overhasty decisions on operations for sexual allocation in newborns , and to combat discrimination against inter-sexual people .	-5.9104
An intersexual person , according to the BBC , said : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-3.0558
I maintain the patchwork created by doctors , mutilates and full of scars .	-2.3814
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children per year are neither a boy nor a girl .	-3.9676
They belong to the intersexual , a group falling under the diagnosis of “ sex differential disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( eggs or pants ) , or unusually developed genital mutilation .	-6.1746
Wallis Simpson was perhaps Intersexual .	-1.8205
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible , not to wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if any – for an operation .	-7.0352
The New Yorker psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the problem of gender identification , said the new German law is “ sounding after a good thing . ”	-4.6137
Intersexual children pose an ethical dilemma .	-1.3981
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children don ’ t have it , ” he said .	-5.0057
You can create a sexual allocation without surgery and then see how the identity develops .	-4.4985
Scientific data about how a child develops its sex identity at all is not very accurate .	-3.4204
No one knows why it happens .	-3.1222
It is like the mystery why people are homosexual .	-1.7995
In a report to the European Commission in 2011 , inter-sexual people are to be different from transsexual or transgender-persons , because their status is not gender , but because of their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically defined either at the same time or not clearly as one .	-9.7553
These properties were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hairs , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as organs and genitals , or chromosetal structures and hormones .	-6.0490
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination that faces inter-sexual and transgender people in the workplace , as well as of the extent of harassment , violence and pre-trial criticism .	-6.1982
Not boys who match gender have a special camp now .	-4.3171
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to show male , female , or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.7126
In June , Australians Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ gender ” person , after a court had given lifetime preservation of a “ non-defined ” sexual status .	-4.9121
In addition to M and W , German cards will have a third assignment , X for Intersexual , the Interior Ministry .	-5.0413
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , as a news announcement on France 24 .	-4.5953
In 2011 , tens of French members of the harsh Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.8145
The USA ' s Catholic Online website has also spoken out against the German law : ' If the world is broken into a new state , where gender is a choice , but sexual activity is not , then we are clearing two other pillars of civilisation . '	-7.0367
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone , she would have it better if babies were assigned a sex to birth .	-4.2198
“ The parent child is already stressful enough even without further restrictions , especially if one does not know the sex of his own child , ” she said the parent 's website .	-5.6210
Children need stability and security .	-0.7334
Historically , children born with both male and female sexual intercourse have been referred to as Hermapheal returns , according to the attractive Greek God that had both sexes .	-6.0388
Even ten years ago , medicine regarded sex as something to be deleted and then rebuilt .	-3.5593
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , having become aware of the complexity of gender identity , and doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when it grows with the sex they are allocated .	-6.5361
“ In the mid-twentieth century , one called that a psychiatric emergency , ” Drescher said .	-4.0531
When such a child was born , not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-3.1104
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with non-clear genitals goes back to Dr. John Money from Johns Hopkins University , who believed that gender is a form .	-5.7905
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental impediments – such as parents ’ achievement of a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , and coined the idea of a person as male or female .	-6.0949
But in a case called “ John / Joan ” in 1966 , his theories were controversial .	-3.5564
He counsels the parents of a boy whose penis was cut off when feeding , to castrating the child and also to remove his pants and then to extend it as a girl .	-7.3578
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of transforming what he was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.2138
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to the male sex and married a woman .	-2.3303
With 38 but he commit suicide .	-1.8503
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practise this model .	-2.3714
But in the 1990 ’ s , when the Internet came to power , the overlapping of these sexual operations to the public , who are “ not happy with the result . ”	-5.2708
For example , with Jim Bruce , a 36 year-old author from Montana , who was born with XY-male chromosomes , but marginal genitals .	-4.4641
Physicians were not aware of whether he had a big Klitori or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-5.9984
So his external organ and the pants were removed shortly after the birth of 1976 Surgery and he was extended as a girl .	-4.7040
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.5704
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he said about ABCNews.com .	-2.0581
I was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.2534
At the age of 18 he should be given a vaginal test .	-3.7595
But , because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical acts .	-3.3989
What he thought was shocking .	-1.7559
I was sterilised at my birth – and nobody ever told me that .	-2.4846
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough test eggs to develop genitals .	-4.4867
When he learned the truth , he moved to male identity , received a testosterone injection and removed his breasts .	-5.2975
It has become infertile through the operation .	-2.0593
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to perceive intersexual people as normal .	-4.2038
But Anne Tamar Mattis , managing director of the California Law Group Advocates for Informed Choice , ensures that the German law can “ roll out and stigmatize ” .	-4.5271
“ Many activists are concerned that Germany ’ s decision may encourage parents to take swift decisions and to “ not set ” the child , she the .	-7.3814
We fear that this will benefit interventions .	-2.4786
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female sex and to wait .	-2.3218
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.4490
Tamar Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize the third sex . ”	-3.8487
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions on their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.8689
The German law is about the allocation of birth .	-1.8921
This is not a battle to force small children at this time .	-2.6993
When they grow up , they can decide their own bodies .	-3.1093
But Dr. Arlene Barrate , a breast radiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual inequality disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ Authorized ” states both parents and children .	-5.5052
Katie , the daughter of Barkit , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD named complete Androgen-resistant .	-3.6208
Because of the reception of the target cells for test osterons , Katrie developed female characteristics .	-4.7068
She has a vagina , but not an nerus and not ovaries .	-5.7100
Today , Kathie 29 and married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a employee of childhood psychiatric .	-5.2487
Although it is infertile , it is hoped to be able to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-5.0190
“ The law gives parents space , which does not have to take decisions that rush , ” said Barkit .	-4.9355
It gives them the time to do various tests and to clear things and gives them time before writing them ‘ male ’ or ‘ female ’ .	-4.4153
In this way everything is fine – one pulls the child big and loves it .	-3.1587
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the happiness of your parents .	-3.2513
And you do not need to undertake an operation that cannot be undone .	-4.7797
“ That concludes children ’ s decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they believe they are not doing the right thing . ”	-7.6289
Finally , the child decides on gender , which is better suited to him – and that is wonderful .	-4.0554
This will enable children to decide for themselves .	-2.6643
Unknown girls hurt by shot from car .	-3.6076
The unknown was that when shots from a car , a twelve year old person was injured in Saxony-Anhalt .	-5.8008

That was the case with the police in the castle .	-8.0199
The girl was easily injured on the left bank .	-1.5646
Rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .	-3.7547
The shot came from a small car that had passed away and stopped at a group of six children .	-3.7261
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.3200
The perpetrators also opened onto a bus stop .	-2.9635
A disc broke down .	-1.5681
Then they went about it .	-3.0468
The crime show was identified on Friday .	-3.2357
Until now , the police inspection unit Kempten has a quiet Halloween night .	-5.3640
The officials were only recalled twice for the children who were waiting for them against house façades .	-7.5361
Because the owners realized this in time and dropped the egg reserves immediately , no material damage would have arisen .	-6.5332
The room was too small for a 4 star hotel .	-8.6429
A guest at the " Bishoper-Friendly " trail reported that his car with Klodocument has been caressed and his bike net turned out .	-9.9955
Until the police arrived , however , the man found his wheel-hide in the immediate vicinity , so the police had not to continue working .	-6.7725

" I hope you don 't have any fear of spider ? " , asks Walgrapes Riu and shows a fat spider on the door .	-7.4666
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.1530
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.7762
However , the reason is not a spinning phobia , but the concern that at age the many staircase can no longer be able to handle the house and the apartment is explained .	-8.6843
In addition , since a Menisus-operation , the interrogator has had to know the basics of what it means to move with a handicap on the floor .	-8.6379
More recently , a book of her published about ' happy life at age - Which form of living is the best for me ? '	-5.9569
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going at all at age ' , they start to tell .	-4.9943
When she moved to Maionette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.2995
Today , with the middle of fifty , Walgrapes Riu thinks differently .	-3.6246
She also knows that she is one of the few people who are dealing with the subject of ' living at age ' .	-4.7470
Most of the time we get rid of it .	-4.5084

" But for me this would be a living community , " she says with a touch of urgency .	-6.7924
Not at all like a student star with a common bathroom and kitchen .	-5.5402
'At age you simply need its retraction rooms ' , so Riu .	-6.3169
Nevertheless , the bookauthors do not want to rule out the fact that a Home Community can work .	-4.5772
But that would have to be different from that of the classic student WG .	-5.0313
And sometimes you just want his quiet , believes it .	-4.0658
At least in the country 's capital , she is not alone .	-5.9455
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for so long , " is also the experience of Teresa Rütten , the leader of civil service life at the age of the state .	-5.9228
Your department advises people around the subject of ' older ' .	-4.2382
Therefore , especially elderly people would often take into account uncertainties and restrictions , only to remain in their familiar environment , which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest .	-6.7613
There are many possibilities today for making the house or apartment accessible .	-4.7941
Riu recommends to all those who deal with the house ’ s transition to old age or apartment , to obtain thorough information and not to consult the first manufacturer .	-10.0876
Today there is also the case for the qualitative reconstruction of specialists .	-4.5450
Even in the rental apartment , it is possible to realize one or another , and if it is only the toilet rise , the interior architects clarify .	-6.8295
But it is not always possible to change the existing apartment in an old way , even if it is still so beautiful .	-6.5513
This experience had to make Walgrapes Ries .	-2.7272
It is possible to install a staircase inside the apartment , which is also paved with stairs to the apartment door , but that would be far more difficult .	-7.4053
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.8189
Before moving away , it greys more than before the spider on its front door .	-4.7978
America wants Snowden to continue to prosecute	-7.4763
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officials Edward Snowden .	-2.1398
He is still accused of having passed away secret information .	-3.2550
That is why he must face criminal proceedings in the US , said the spokesperson of the US Department of Foreign Affairs , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-5.2766
The recent comments made by Snowden would not change this either .	-4.4665
Before that , Germany ’ s Green Minister , Hans-Christian Strobel , had called for a meeting with Snowden in Moscow to join the US not to continue criminalize it .	-6.4139
Psaki stressed that the statements made by one parliament are those of a German government member .	-6.4675
Secret service Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities .	-4.0423
But first he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.2589
The former NSA staff , called for by the US , made it clear in a non-addressed letter , which the Green politician Hans-Christian Strobel , published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden Federal Government , and led the Federal Foreign Office .	-8.8292
The letter has the following wording following a translation :	-3.8404
the person responsible	-4.4548
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .	-2.4888
I named Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted and / or directly employed by a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency .	-4.2946
As I became involved in these institutions , I witnessed systematic lawsuits from my government , which led me to take moral responsibility for action .	-4.8262
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was faced with a serious and persistent buzz that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-3.7705
I live in exile now and enjoy a temporary asylum that gives me the Russian Federation under international law .	-3.9809
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.2855
Citizens around the world , and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-embracing surveillance that is accountable to no one , as a service to the public .	-5.2705
These spy revelations have attracted many proposals about new laws and policies aimed at the former hidden misuse of public confidence .	-4.1597
The benefits for society from these gains are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks incurred in buying have been visibly reduced .	-5.3379
Although the result of my efforts has been shown to be positive , my government is still treating dissent as a travesty , seeking to criminalise and indicate political speech .	-4.9325
Nevertheless , the truth is not a crime .	-1.8930
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will adopt this negative stance .	-3.2476
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to take due and legal action to provide good information on the issues that have been made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-6.7576
I look forward to a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that we all protect .	-4.8917

" The building is in good hands " , says Winterthur Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.7542
The parish has sold it to an individual .	-5.0837
The Council agreed to the sale at its recent meeting in the non-public sphere .	-5.3933
The building moved its owners into a " reasonable " price .	-2.5553
" The municipality is satisfied " , says Maier .	-1.7087
The budget was EUR 100 000 .	-1.7901

Report : Obama ’ s campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton .	-2.3712
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have thought to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign by Hillary Clinton , the New York Times .	-3.5561
The revelation is the most valuable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperimn and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-4.0081
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and they reported on Thursday evening that the President ’ s top adviser , “ extensive group meetings and polls ” , would have done to find out whether Obama ’ s waning hope for re-election would be better off if he leaves the .	-8.1222
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ nationalist correspondent , the book thoroughly describes the history of the campaign ’ s leading staff and the White House , namely the former White House Chief of Bill Daley , what effect it has on poll figures to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-Presidents .	-7.4523
The potential change was a staunced secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-3.4373
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest aides – including Daley , the former Campaign leader Obama , Jim Messina , and the former chief adviser to the White House , David Axelrod and David Plufe – knew about the proposed change .	-4.1156
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley was at the top of the effort to exchange Biden despite its “ close , personal relationship , ” before ultimately choosing such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would “ not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.5306
In an interview with Martin Daley , the government has actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-3.1924
“ I mentioned a whole series of things to be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.6425
It must be remembered that the President had some terrible poll values at the time , so we thought : “ To God ’ s sake what we do ? ”	-5.8400
While Daley called the “ cure for care , ” he said to Anderson ’ s CNN Cooper that considerable work had been done during the re-election campaign to find out if such a train pays for the ballot box .	-7.2751
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think about something seriously , ” Martin pointed to AC360 .	-4.2185
But it ’ s not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about an exchange .	-3.3776
Martin told CNN , he asked Daley whether his boss had known about the potential change .	-3.2156
While Daley explained that he did not believe that the President of the possible change was “ conscious , ” the former chief of staff said that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew .	-7.4683
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political probes had reached his desk .	-4.6843
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thinks Obama did not know about whether to let Biden fall in the elections .	-5.0466
Martin replied : “ The possible ” .	-4.4310
What happens to my e-mail on the way ?	-2.2942
E-mail actually means electronic letters .	-3.6351
Did the letter secrecy be implemented in the design of the Internet service , similar to in conventional mail ? are ? , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.3360
In the concept of early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-3.9965
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have failed to establish a stable foundation for a secure exchange of letters .	-5.4778
Therefore , a traditional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.8030
If a user sends a mail to " Anna " , the hosts of the two are connected directly ?	-4.5736
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step .	-3.4137
For example , if you have a GMNL account , Google would be .	-3.5644
This mail server sends the contents to the provider who uses Benni .	-2.7553
You can run the mail over a number of other servers on the Internet .	-5.7874
You can then call the contents on your provider .	-3.7955
Will traditional emails be read on their way through the network ?	-3.6174
Most emails are often read by software robots on the move .	-3.4565
By way of provider of the sender , you normally check whether the mail will lead a malicious program as an attachment .	-6.7628
A Virus check is also performed on receiver systems .	-3.1251
In addition , the provider will check whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or otherwise sorted out into a spam folder .	-7.0444
Do the robots have another task ?	-2.1753
For systems like GMVE , the robots also determine the information Google needs to place Context Advertising .	-4.6381
When Anna and Benni communicate on their next holiday trip , Google can show appropriate links to travel offers .	-5.5410
Do unknown people also read the e-mails with ?	-3.9578
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail is extremely low .	-4.8030
In theory , this is possible .	-1.9492
In firms , administrators often have the option of reading electronic mail .	-2.8292
The law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of emails .	-4.2016
This includes possible illegal interventions .	-3.1726
Is it possible to protect emails against the users ?	-3.2912
With encryption based on the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against mitread .	-4.5768
With a high technical effort , it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an email communication so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom .	-5.4187

Mother in the forest disappeared and pension funds collected .	-2.6476
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg invented a plan .	-2.5895
He committed the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care money .	-3.6133
In order to be able to collect further pension and caremoney , a 67-year-old Wolfenburger has buried his dead mother after police investigations .	-4.8255
First of all , he had covered the death of the 89 year old , and he had received the money for more than a year and a half .	-5.7612
The 67-year-olds now have to be responsible for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-4.0421
So the hidden man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-3.5178
It was suggested in May that the man had no need for medicines for the mother in need .	-5.8664
Pensioners told that his mother traveled to Spain .	-3.0444
Because the official showed this strange way , they continued to study .	-5.1575
It came out that the two had lived in a common flat for more than 15 years and had recently maintained it .	-5.0024
The 677-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.7298
According to the police , output showed no sign of a capital offense .	-3.4442
Fancy of ice cream lit in the dark ?	-2.5895
A British entrepreneur has developed the first in the dark ice – with the help of quality .	-3.4840
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent characteristics of the marine animals and created a brilliant sation .	-4.5721
The idea came to him after having read a research into quality and convinced Chinese scientists to establish the shining protein .	-6.2095
The ice cream responds with the tongue , increasing the pH value in protein and triggering the lights .	-3.8995
Chris explains that the cooking ice responds to the heat in the mouth and luminaire – the more you read , the brighter it becomes .	-5.5466
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.8685
The protein used in the ice cream responds to a neutral pH value .	-1.3646
When the mouth heated the protein , the pH value increases and the ice is lit .	-2.9360
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed to us ideally to put it on the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-4.7204
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I 've ever produced , because the quality lamp is four times more expensive than gold .	-2.7477
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.0601
But it is delicious .	-2.9146
Charlies experimental company , based in Bristol , is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-3.3896
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .	-2.2845
He says : “ I like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.0780
This is impossible in itself because of the heat dissipation caused by the ice crystals from which the ice cream consists ; but I suspect we find a way to create it .	-5.6582
The ice cream uses the fluorescence properties of a quality artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-2.4058
The TSV Morsum is still in the handball league for six matches .	-3.9092
Now it is the team of Ingo Ehler tomorrow to the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-5.3923
With this game the season starts new for us .	-3.4079
" I hope that we finally have our head free , " Ehler 's behaviour is optimistic .	-4.4382
At last he has available his complete cader , except for the durability of his dirty Hendrik Blohme .	-6.5984
Even Daverd uses as we do at Tempospil .	-4.9322
Therefore , we must keep our error rate low .	-2.8486
But above all , we need to increase our coverage , which , most recently , has left everything but a .	-5.3649
The former coach , Thomas Panitz , is more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-5.7908
The game was of course a house number .	-1.3271
But that is why we are not the favourite , because everything can still happen in Derby .	-4.1017
However , Panitz now wants to put in Morsum to start a series .	-4.3034
There is no shortage of Jan-Malte Jodat .	-3.1008
In order to achieve this , the Joost Winds Team , who is active with double game rights at the A-Youth Coach in Bremen , is celebrating its seasonality .	-9.3958
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-3.0388
Halloween 2013 : In numbers	-0.7871
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.6346
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and suffer for our neighbourhood .	-3.8027
Today I became Halloween-Mudoon .	-3.6845
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute my apartment from sweets , and I will not do so this year .	-4.6788
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween .	-2.7868
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year , giving a total of $ 6.9 billion for candy , costumes , and decorations , as the US Federation of retailers ( NRF ) .	-4.5798
One thing I am looking forward to every Halloween again is the trend values .	-3.9000
The costumes will account for roughly 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , the NRF .	-3.5682
This year are exciting items of the last cry .	-3.7574
Women no longer have to hide in sexy clothes , they can now also host tempting food such as pizza , hamburger or carrots .	-6.0015
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of Zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft Punk Cosmen will make it into the instant food this year .	-5.0233
According to Google , the most common costumes Zombies , Batman , pirate and witches are .	-2.8461
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.5389
Last year , we broke our dogs and seemed to me rather than alone .	-4.7639
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for their pets , that is the NRF .	-3.2894
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-3.1944
As regards candy , we are not zipped .	-4.4780
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , as The Nielsen Company .	-1.9269
These are about 270 million kilograms of placorreals , floats , bonbons and rubber-bears .	-5.5700
So good news for the US Department of Trade , 41 million people , who move through the quarter with the phrase “ sweetes or sour ” .	-6.1742
In fact , we are going to buy over 40 million kilos of chocolate for Halloween and - do not let us know - eat .	-4.4399
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , the National Association of Couples Manufacturers .	-3.9926
These are about nine billion masons .	-2.8838
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to resolve .	-2.2899
There is nothing more to Halloween than houses in which it spades .	-3.6722
They have great names such as " terror disabled the Wall " ( which is actually in a real prison ) , " Howl-O Scream " and " The House of Shock " .	-5.4103
There are actually 1,200 official Spukhäuser in the United States , who make 500 million dollars of revenue , America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photos on which you are pinched into the pants and then putting friends on Facebook , where you will not get back , and one of the type on which you stands is a commentary like “ aesthetic pressure . ”	-10.4704
But we finally come to the kisses .	-3.8723
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Kürbis when we were children , and the carvings of a pumpkin sister is like the Christmas tree – something we made from small .	-6.3705
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest , so that most of us grew up with the idea of carving the kitten and not sitting in it .	-5.2446
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , the US Census Bureau .	-2.0183
The Kürbisendne , which was slowly rotated in the front garden , is presumably due to Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year .	-5.9999
If you want to go right , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California , and then carve some of the ports from their 921 pound heavy Kürbis .	-7.8008
Fireplace in Helmhold : Relief workers collect stolen corpses .	-6.1508
The fire brigade had to leave in helmet on the late Thursday night .	-3.6124
A three-family house in the county court starts to fire at night .	-3.8040
The rescue forces have a stolen corpse from the house .	-3.0072
In the event of a fire in helmet law , rescue forces have found a stolen body in a three-family house .	-3.8924
Whether it is still unclear to a resident , as a speaker from the police in Bayreuth said .	-4.4608
It was on the ground floor of the house on the late Thursday evening .	-3.5633
When the fire brigade struck , the flames were beat from a window .	-3.4611
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.3062
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.7056
The entire ground floor has been damaged .	-1.4744
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spokesperson continued to explain .	-3.7020
For the time being , the building is no longer habitable .	-4.8182
At first , the precise cause of the fire was not clear .	-2.1781
Germany ’ s largest church has started a more obvious campaign to promote the profession of pastors .	-4.8796
The background is a possible parish : The Evangelical Church of Hannover expects to halve around 1,800 pastors and pastors in the current situation until 2030 .	-5.5564
For young people today the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , Pastor Mathis Burfin ( 43 ) said when talking to the evangelical press service .	-4.8029
It is attractive to be able to determine the workflow and the timing of the day .	-3.8270
With Burfin , the Regional Church has for the first time commissioned a Pastor to inspire young people for the study of terminology .	-7.4557
At present , less and less young people choose to study theology .	-4.0522
Burfien put this back to the process of evangelizing : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-4.6326
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.5659
I am Mr terminal and can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.4297
pastors could be very close to people as a sailor .	-3.9128
They deserve as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.4356
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but Theologues would have a secure employer .	-4.9322
This goes against the young people of today who do not just want to go for a career but for a happy job .	-6.0439
According to the Regional Church , which covers three quarters of interests , around 60 pastors are currently in retirement .	-4.9670
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theses study begin their Viking profession .	-4.3388
In sparsely populated areas such as Harz , Emsland or Wendland it is hard to fill jobs in the future .	-4.8341
Burfien wants to organise school days for young people and invite prominent people who have studied theology .	-5.3214
The study of terminology offers a broad education .	-4.6611
You can even become Federal President .	-2.6173
Land Rover Rally Series announced .	-1.6774
In the interior you will find horse seats and six-point belts as well as a club club .	-5.6740
The options range from enhanced brakes , a service package with the care of Bowler Workers ’ Mechanics and logistical support to inviting vehicles between events .	-5.0798
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally-customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.8032
They are not all experienced drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as a way to world-class events .	-4.9006
We are pleased to be able to open this way into partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare newcomers to the streets and the reality of Rally Raid .	-6.2923
We really enjoyed developing the Defense of Challenge cars – that will be an entertaining gathering .	-5.0473
There is also a training and test day at the Defend Challenge in February , as well as the option of participating in West Africa and the Middle East .	-3.8909
Fire extinguishers , designed to rescue a hip that was laid down at 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock edge in a quarry .	-6.7321
Cockerpanie-hip Ruby was overcome after a smaller traffic accident .	-4.1803
Three days later , it was discovered by a walkers in the quarry in their unfortunate situation .	-3.8606
Fire fighters pick up on the rock wall and saved the dog from the safe death .	-5.0674
The fire brigade was able to secure a hip that sat in a rock wall on 15 meters high .	-5.9805
The nine months old Cockerpanie-hip Ruby was away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days only before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.0069
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his friend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-4.8240
They had desperately wanted to see their missing hip and published cries for help in social networks when they were aborted after the small traffic accident in the quarry .	-7.5535
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walkers who pointed out his dog saw the randomized Ruby in the 15 meter high section of the quarry .	-8.1283
The Cleckheatons Fire Station ’ s technical rescue team turned out to be a spot to rescue Rubens , who was then transported up in a dog box .	-8.7588
Andy Clayton , a specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.6143
It was in the middle of the rocky wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-3.8039
She did not move muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff frozen .	-4.1910
But now it is a good thing .	-2.1579
She then has a few dog cake .	-4.2126
That was quite unusual .	-1.8752
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.6563
Peter Lau , a specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge fortune . ”	-2.9844
They were able to be very badly injured or worse .	-3.4484
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian , but it did not know anything except for exhaustion and dehydration .	-5.6783
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ At the rescue was scary . ”	-3.2574
I could not believe that it was really there .	-4.6962
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor .	-1.1643
The veterinarian explained that if the exhaustion had become too large and had collapsed , it would probably have sunk .	-3.7823
The firefighters have done a great deal .	-2.0781
It was absolutely brave what they had done .	-3.2033
We are simply as grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.4564
Scott Alderson added from Keighaley : “ We were afraid that she would fall down , but she remained above . ”	-3.6687
The firefighters were great .	-1.0820
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.4040
Mick Jaguar explained that he never did Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.5667
With an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she was a backgroan singer on Jaggers song “ Old Habes Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-5.7458
Perry explained that she had eaten with the Altrocker in the evening and that “ he had an interest in me when I was 18 . ”	-6.0794
She added : “ This was a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.9481
In a statement , a representative Jaguar , 70 , on Thursday , said that he “ categorically denied that he had ever made approaches to Katy Perry . ”	-3.9203
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused it with someone else . ”	-2.7844
Perry was one of the Sängerys who had a guest appearance at this year 's rolling-Stones-tour .	-4.6108
Her new album “ Prism ” landed on the first floor at Square 1 this week .	-4.5990
George Kerevan : European emigration gives Scotland the choice .	-3.3632
A new day , a new saga about independence .	-2.6526
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-1.7498
This provides the keyword for stories about Pass controls in Berwick and a fixed border along the HadriansStation .	-4.6564
Indeed , in the Strathcl proposal , attention was drawn to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but it played – preferably – no role in the headlines .	-6.1046
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often manage their strict rules when making them more convenient .	-3.5681
As Scotland is not a member of the Schengen area at the moment , the continued non-respect for Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what is really wanted by the Scots .	-6.6243
So that is not a story .	-3.7536
And one that has already come in the years that it is already like a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport control ” drain at least 40 years ago .	-6.2103
An interesting point in the constant repetition of this ancient story is lost .	-3.8099
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe ?	-3.3119
Why to exchange the London yoke against Brussels , especially now ?	-3.0512
These are the real European news : the big plan for the unification of Europe that came into being after the war has stalled .	-4.7148
With the euro crisis , the project has officially died Europe .	-2.9185
Throughout the EU , parties are gaining ground that is hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro over board as a common currency .	-4.4686
Even in Germany , the eurosceptic alternative for Germany – first created this year – was able to win almost five million votes in the federal election in September , effectively driving Free Democrats ( the equivalent of British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-6.1639
There have always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-2.3105
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.5599
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , combined with the straitjacket in which the national economy is forced by maintaining the common currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.7017
The crisis in the euro has little to do with national governments generating excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-3.3547
Instead , the euro system has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to do .	-4.3141
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe is again experiencing a built-in productivity decline with Germany .	-4.3953
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred on by Berlin .	-2.3416
Behind the current budget and monetary problems is a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.9508
As a result of Brussels ’ “ green ” energy shores – a code of subsidies for French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity compared to the United States , and that is four times for gas .	-4.7517
This is a section of costs , as we have already seen in Granterouth .	-5.0129
All world wage festivals do not protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap US shale gas .	-3.9809
As a result , revolution , especially in France , is leading the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.8615
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris at the height of Washington .	-3.2850
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and it has pushed Europe into its own economic policy , which has led to the struggling French economy .	-5.6755
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , EU-enemy Front National has just won a decisive final vote , thereby leaving the ruling socialists in place three .	-8.1068
The National Front is now France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-5.1524
What is Le Pen 's new popularity among the white French of the working class ?	-2.7961
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-EU monetary bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.8695
If the anti-EU parties perform well during these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time , such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.4619
This is the point I would like to make : in the not-too-distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-4.9522
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” which favored General de Gaulle .	-3.2191
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold up in the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-3.4523
I expect Britain to distinguish itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the US .	-3.7804
But Washington ’ s growing Pacific interest suggests that Britain will be alone in Atlantic rain .	-2.8139
Where is Scotland left with all this ?	-2.9239
We can decide to be a region of small England ( in the final consequence ) .	-3.3401
Or we can defend our own economic interests – which includes saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can be .	-4.5700
I suspect Scotland might well travel around Europe if we retain our own currency .	-4.1395
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations .	-3.6115
Otherwise , we should consider keeping Norway doing the same and keeping our economic independence .	-3.2785
The SNP government in Scotland – remarkably – is the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that the Finance Minister , Mr Alistair Darling , and the subsequent Tory-Lib Demo-Coalition , had to be responsible .	-6.6181
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only to be forced on austerity by Berlin and Brussels .	-2.9886
Early puberty : Faster Grows Up	-3.4620
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age counterparts , as studies show .	-2.8758
Changes in the body do not necessarily mean the puberty immediately .	-4.5965
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.2515
Experts believe that epidemiological obesity is a trigger of early puberty .	-2.6459
The early puberty trend is less pronounced for boys .	-2.2794

Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows up breasts and shamanism at the age of seven or eight years ?	-4.2300
At the annual conference of the Children ’ s Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endiokologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and introduced a new standard .	-5.2849
“ I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents – typically this is not a sign that the puberty is now fast entering , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-6.4333
In the past , girls show obvious signs of development , such as growing breasts , shampoos and Achilles ' hair , as well as body bites .	-7.8661
However , there was only a slight shift at the age of the Menagee ( the appearance of the first rule blood ) in the last 40 years .	-5.5366
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , somewhat less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.2049
“ When the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the Menagee , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early puberty in girls : The essential counselor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-5.3603
Time is the most precise test of how puberty steps up .	-2.6028
It is controversial , which is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” when the chest enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-4.8823
In most cases , the process is slowing or stagnant – something that a paediatrician can monitor closely .	-2.6614
When things go faster , tests may be shown by an endometriologist , so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be .	-6.5098
There are methods of delaying an early menstruation and defense of another consequence : the early aging of bones , which can lead to permanent growth inhibition and thus lead to a small increase in body life in adults .	-6.7484
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and emotional maturity .	-4.1772
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.2795
Kaplowitz is timid about medicines , but he admits : “ The downtrodden of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and feelings of girls , unlike their peers . ”	-5.5530
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.4933
“ They are concerned about the risk of pregnancy or about how to handle the hygiene page , ” said Kaplowitz .	-4.7482
“ It was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter was ten with her days .	-3.0841
Even though there were initial signs and we spoke of menstruation , it was emotionally not prepared .	-3.2477
She came terrified and excited from the school to home because she was the first in her friend marriage .	-4.3835
There are many publicly published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.8138
But there is no conclusive proof that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages would have originated in the media .	-4.4429
Babies are similar to girls used to become puberty .	-4.9743
Kaplowitz considers that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-4.6498
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 , through girls aged between six and nine years , who create a connection between body fat and the entry into puberty .	-6.2350
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.7087
In this country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white counterparts .	-2.7478
There are various explanations for this .	-1.5774
Global seems to be an early puberty of all sorts of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-3.7173
Another mystery : although boys are growing the face and shame already before , the trend toward full previous puberty is not as strong as girls .	-6.9332
Other doctors at the AAA conference highlighted the complexity of the issue .	-2.6116
The appearance of acne and shamanism is spread even among babies and young children .	-2.8453
“ We need to be careful about identifying the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endokringologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-4.0640
Parents should not hesitate to consult their paediatrician how they should talk to their child .	-3.1032
“ This can mean that you must talk earlier than expected , ” says Kaplowitz .	-4.9586
If you remain calm , the child normally responds well .	-3.3176
Girls who sleep early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier .	-4.2762
Jumbo-manufacturer negotiating large orders over seat width	-2.9595
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a clash over the width of seats in the tourist class for long-haul flights , showing the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-3.8823
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who seek airlines the most , but this particular area is the key to efficiency in the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-9.5814
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that airlines should decide .	-4.9662
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range carriers , and record contracts are awaiting the event from November 17th to 21st .	-5.8764
As the rear part of the aircraft is roofed – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results to provide the new “ mini-Jumbo ” design .	-8.6372
Boeing claims that his modernised “ 777X ” captures 406 people in the tourist class , which are broad over 17 inches , allowing ten per row .	-7.0022
Airbus explains that the competing A350 version is targeting 350 people in 18 seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-5.6376
Aircraft giants often inform hiebe about technical details by advertising in the specialized press .	-4.8022
Airbus is now calling ahead of the Dubai Airshow , where 777X , with more than 100 orders , will likely make the race directly to the public .	-5.1496
Recently , the company issued an ad that could mark the beginning of a new ad war , and donors showed a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant , entitled “ Would you accept that ? ”	-6.3606
“ Boeing proposes long-range flights in seats that are more close than regional turbo-props , ” says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy .	-4.5922
Due to changes in dietary habits , people are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.1812
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul flights , and by the end of the century , the weight of the male average US has increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to US Health Department data .	-4.6075
According to US health statistics , the gender average in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm .	-3.1705
Airbus says that its rival is in the 1950s , when the average body size of the newly programmed “ jet set ” was narrower .	-5.8314
As Airbus has done studies , an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat has increased the sleeping quality by 53 % .	-3.7698
Boeing denies Airbus ’ s figures on the size of the seat and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines are balanced between tariffs and equipment .	-6.6790
The company also explains , according to studies , that the aircraft ’ s experience is more than the seating width .	-5.5627
“ There is really a need to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains the flying expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-5.4666
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-2.0224
You know their business better than any other .	-1.7698
As far as passengers are concerned , there is more freedom of nemesis , but for manufacturers it will become increasingly an issue that can have an impact on sales .	-7.2598
Behind the discussion is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated $ 700 billion worth of coverage in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-6.2501
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle for the new jet .	-2.8547
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 % more efficiency per seat as the market leader in this segment , the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.6921
The statements made by Boeins on the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared to its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-5.4511
Increased costs per unit are still lower than in currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-5.1722
For this reason , “ Boeing will occupy more seats on its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , head for passenger comfort in Europe ’ s Airbus .	-5.8781
On the other hand , analysts said that full cabins with ten seats per row , when available 777s , indicated that many passengers opted for a closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-7.2602
“ Eight ” cabin width would be great for passengers , but the reality is that from an economic point of view the Airbus offer is driven by the threat of 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , an expert for cabin installation , founding and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-5.5667
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a list of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-3.1598
The world ’ s passenger jet sales even wear a belt to compete .	-4.6471
Even if they are priced with comfort , all the manufacturers also offer high priced jet design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-7.0317
Airbus offers a ten-year A350 , but has not yet sold it according to .	-4.3188
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of adapting its cabins and offering a wide range of seats in the corridors .	-4.7960
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard may well be lost , but could divert attention from the wave of 777X sales .	-5.0663
New anti-nicotene vaccine could make the smoking fun .	-6.7009
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking .	-2.1051
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime from nicotine addiction .	-2.9626
Before human testing , further tests will be needed , which may take some years , but Professor Ronald Crystal from Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-5.2848
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market , but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is more powerful than these approaches , ” Cornell . the of are and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8623
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been changed in such a way that it contains genetic information about the manufacture of nicotine antismokers .	-4.4342
The virus is selectively infected the liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-5.2591
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain , so that they do not experience nicotine high .	-4.3339
Their normal levels of activity have been retained in attempts to use piot. are , , , or . are . , , , , , , , ,	-7.5044
If not vaccination had taken off , researchers declared that the nicotine had reached their brain .	-4.9060
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-3.2400
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-4.1315
The immunizations had to be given so often to maintain the anticortals that they were expensive and impractical .	-4.5955
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably far lower , because it turns liver cells into anticrotational factories .	-4.3959
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be used for people , if he is quite sure , before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-5.6551
More likely , however , is that smokers would use it to stop .	-2.1492
“ You know , when they start to smoke again , they no longer feel fun because of nicotine , and that helps them to break the habit , ” he explains .	-5.5235
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but warned at the same time that further research was needed .	-2.0838
Tribbi contended to be influenced by Obeid . and are .	-3.9151
The former Minister of the Labor Party , Joe Triodi from New South Wales , is starting to investigate the issue of government corruption .	-7.0310
Former Nazi ministers dispute having amended the Maritime Charter Guidelines on the request of his political mentor , Edden Obeid , who had hidden holdings in three lands on state-controlled land .	-6.4543
The Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission ) , on Friday , expanded its investigations into the question of whether Obeid had influenced various ministers of state to extend lease contracts at the Ciry Quay , where the Obeids run two restaurants and a café without having to extend the call for tenders in August 2005 .	-7.8326
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Triodi knew about the interest of the land covered by Obeids , after Triodis 's previous deputy chief , Lynne Ashpolline , announced on Thursday .	-10.7963
In many years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had pressed for public tender for lease contracts .	-3.4918
The hoppers were opposed to this and also wanted longer periods .	-4.7725
In 2009 , the lease contracts for companies at the Cirko-Am , which brought the Obeids $ 2.5 million a year , were extended without public tender .	-5.9903
Triodi , who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , was originally in favour of public tenders .	-3.5563
But he dispute having made changes to Obeid ’ Bitte , who , as triple proved , had pushed the government to restructure the rents .	-6.0309
One of the ICAC ’ s submitted phone label showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid , Tripoi , and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had changed to the Port Ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-5.3226
“ Was the subject discussed in these telephone talks to draw up commercial regulation ? ” , the Deputy Commissioner , Anthony Whealy Triodi , asked .	-6.6120
“ No ” , Triodi replied .	-2.6937
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-1.9807
Definitely not between me and Mr Obieid .	-1.9153
Israeli combat aircraft use target in Syria , as official sources .	-2.9746
Israeli gunners attacked Thursday Square eight target in the Syrian port of Latonia , confirmed a senior government official to Fox News .	-5.2196
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .	-2.4352
According to the Associated Press , the objective was Russian SA-125-rocket .	-3.1305
At least twice this year Israel has already had airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria .	-2.7947
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be “ real test . ”	-3.1595
The government is considering extending measures to promote a “ real ” scheme for foreign workers with 457 visa .	-5.4814
If the test is introduced , it would be used by a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used for occupation of non-skilled jobs or as a back door for family and friends to Australia .	-5.0224
Today , a proposal for discussion was published by the government , following the previous MPs of the laboratory party , Maxime McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments regarding foreign workers , because Australia could be perceived as an insult to neighbors .	-6.9644
“ Prominent statements such as ‘ foreignness ’ should be backsliding , and Australia ’ s first ‘ are a very unpleasant retreat in times when trade unions demand a protected labour market ’ , ” she said to Australia India Institute today .	-8.7906
Historically , white workers should be protected – and if some in the region accept this historical artefact , I would not be surprised .	-4.1084
The proposal for a discussion revolves around twelve measures that were once devised by the former Secretary of State , Chris Bowen .	-6.6324
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who visited talks about smuggling in Sri Lanka yesterday , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and the others are still under consideration .	-3.8096
If the “ principle of authenticity ” is adopted , someone who requests a visa could be examined in such a way as to whether “ the request is genuine in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-10.9027
Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders , after all , hundreds of companies in the past who initially wanted to support only a small number of workers .	-4.7688
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old sri-lankian asylum apparently died in a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island .	-5.4130
The disturbing nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult Cousin since his father 's death on Wednesday , who was also on the boat .	-4.7180
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christima Island Hospital , where he died .	-2.7688
A study was announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HSV railway project for Scotland .	-4.3086
The work of HS2 Ltd is being proposed to implement early stages 1 in 2026 high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England .	-4.4903
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.8594
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said that he is very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-3.6746
Phase 1 is a new high-speed route between London and the West Midlands .	-2.2881
Following the completion of Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.8000
In June , the government fixed the estimated cost of building high-speed trains between London and Northern England at <unk> 42.6 billion .	-3.6551
The British Government , engaged in talks with Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further track capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland .	-4.7610
This includes the possibility of a journey time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.9121
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for H2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-3.6143
We are making progress with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-3.1056
Without it we are faced with a crisis of capacity in our rail network .	-2.6287
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.9980
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.5521
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for a “ unequivocal ” commitment to Scottish integration into the HSM network .	-4.8233
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link has enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but Scotland ’ s economic strength also provides an argument for rapid rail connections across Britain . ”	-5.3491
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to look at the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which will bring benefits to all and supplement the Glasgow Edinburgh link , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-6.8351
I look forward to looking at the study report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .	-4.4622
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for now .	-3.1980
Consumers must continue to bail out Tablets and smart phones at launch and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax the rules on such devices .	-5.9321
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their targets so that passengers can read , watch , or play videos during critical flight stages , if they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.0617
During the majority of the flight , passengers are already allowed , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-4.4513
Australian societies observe the decision to implement which US airlines have to do less work , but do not pursue immediate plans to amend their regulations .	-5.4305
The CASA Air Safety Authority also stated that the announcement was made , but it was stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight phases in Australia still apply .	-5.4486
“ CASA has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft ” , has been posted .	-4.8718
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at any time and to comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew .	-5.4153
Virgin has already held talks on flights with the CASA on making use of its Wi entertainment system and has declared that changes should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.9955
“ We would like to see a review of the licensing of electronic devices through CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” a speaker said .	-4.6931
Qantas explained that the rules will remain in place until now .	-4.8699
“ Our current guidelines indicate that electronic equipment cannot be used at launch and landing , and we do not currently have any plans to change that , ” the company explained .	-4.6883
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines .	-1.6062
However , we are always interested in developments in rules that can benefit passengers , and we will certainly be looking at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.9403
The decision has different implications for US companies depending on the age of the fleet .	-3.4577
They must show that their aircraft can tolerate the radio malfunctions of mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer support .	-6.3664
“ Once a carrier has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-bookers and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA was known .	-6.5455
In rare cases , during a poor sight , the crew will show passengers while landing off .	-8.1863
The group also recommended that heavier devices start and landing safely under the seat or in the threads over the seats .	-4.1680
Before the return to the Schalke , the BVB trailers equipped with lants for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-11.9165
After this , Borussia Dortmund announced the consequences .	-4.9734
Before the Friday game of the football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras responded with a silence - first of all .	-4.8155
It was an uncultive , almost already spoken acoustics , that offered the viewer to the tune of the German Vice-Chancellor Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal of an park .	-8.4672
People were mostly interested in listening to their voices .	-5.9945
The southern galleries , on the other hand , where the most loyal - and fair - BVB fans stand , presented themselves exceptionally quiet : no singing , no slaughter .	-7.8786
The podium of the Capo , who otherwise coordinates the joint fire , remained vacant .	-3.5600
And in the front of the gallery a big banner broke out with the sign " Stadionban " .	-6.6176
Only when Torhwing 's novel Weidenfeller came to the place as the first BVB player , did he cancel the release .	-8.4269
When his team colleagues followed , there were vocal vocals and blows - but not everywhere .	-4.6998
There is nothing in the central galleries of 12 and 13 in the south .	-4.1255
Also that Stadionacher Norbert Dick once again listed the positive experiences of recent days - Derbyvictory , victory over Arsenal , contract extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause festivities .	-5.3855
Only five minutes before the call of the Capo will be his podium - and , until then , the actual tension was expressed in a noisy cry , as a gem as usual asked the mood on the slopes in the stadium .	-8.7181
Finally , as always , the southern galleries were in the front - and finally , this was the most open place in the stadium .	-9.1954
And the heavy demand " Derbysieger is standing in " at the latest when the whistle from the southern gallery was back , everything was .	-9.0803
Silence before was a response to what happened in recent days .	-3.2582
A few of the most successful German car drivers were introduced to the public in the Bundesliga .	-9.4359
The game was delayed due to chaotic scenes .	-1.7154
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the leaders of the regional member Ultras after his office - and believes you can hear Watzkes , this was a rather sad day for the fan representatives .	-7.6441
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement " , the BVB Boss announced on a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening .	-3.2981
As an emergency measure , Watzke gave the Ultras a choreography for home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-3.0366
" I banned this , " he explained .	-2.5476
We cannot abandon the zero-tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.4054
Moreover , the Ultras have shown various ways of punishing them - until Tuesday , they now have time to decide for .	-5.1281
Otherwise , Watzke will set a sanction until the end of next week .	-3.1414
" This is drastic " , insured Watzke .	-2.4031
It is important to be curious how the reactions in the southern galleries will be .	-6.4704
deposit houses in Singapore as the middle class crisis has arrived .	-2.8986
In a deposit house at Bendemeeer Shopping Centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga trades a golden armature , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters .	-4.7104
“ My husband and I just bought a house because there is my whole money there , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.0615
Although she earned 3 000 Singapore dollars every month ( about 1.730 euros ) as an administrative worker and her husband also work , she does not earn the monthly family income , she explains .	-8.0765
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is so great that ValuMax , where she conducted her exchange , was the third deposit house that was listed in the single currency this week .	-8.2450
The quainment of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as a non-secure bank loan .	-4.6184
Typically , deposit houses in Singapore require an effective 17% annual rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overtas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same mall .	-7.9463
However , deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of credit rating or income proof , which is why loans are made faster than banks can .	-5.8108
For this reason , millions of people in the region are paying deposit houses after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing budgetary and consumer debt .	-5.1735
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit on the basis of more loose financial policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income households are looking to compensate for the difference between stowing economies .	-6.8415
This week , the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s pronounced increasing household debt , mainly through rising mortgages , as a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asia ’ s banks .	-4.3973
According to the Agency , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia compared to gross domestic product .	-3.6883
Malaysia , with 80 % of GDP at the top , is a 60 % rise in 2008 .	-3.4552
Economists also worry about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week has just come from a technical recession .	-4.8604
On Thursday , the data showed an ongoing export weakness and a lowering of consumer demand .	-4.1266
“ Ultimately , this means that , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their incomes wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wu , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.0619
Historically , gold prices in the last two years have reinforced the trends in the raising of personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-5.9776
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 deposit houses of the urban state of gold .	-3.4600

Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.5521
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to easing the federal state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” Wilkie said .	-4.7850
According to the federal government , these election benefits will largely offset the recent cuts .	-2.6596
But the opposition ’ s public health spokeswoman at the federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ rightwing solution . ”	-4.3712
“ We are in a position today because the laboratory government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said about ABC TV .	-4.4335

Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition manufacturing facilities , while in the north of the country there have been serious clashes close to one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are being stored .	-6.7352
Also on Thursday , a Syrian active group announced that more than 120,000 people were killed soon after the civil war began three years ago .	-3.4951
The announcement of the ban on chemical weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline .	-2.5119
November 1 , which the organization of Damascus , based in The Hague , had set up to destroy all the equipment for producing chemical weapons or to “ inoperating ” , including all the machines for mixing chemicals to toxic gas and fill in ammunition .	-6.7816
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014 .	-4.8229
Destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-1.9326
But Damascus must begin to destroy the existing weapons and supplies .	-2.6277
According to assumptions , around 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons exist in the country , including Senfgas and the nerve gas of Sarin .	-3.4824
The announcement came at a time when , on Thursday , battles took place in the city of Safira , experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the Syrian Human Rights Centre , based in the United Kingdom , told .	-5.0602
The activist group , who is monitoring the number of dead through a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-5.0060

The fighting points to the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors face , for their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic weapons arsenal is a race against time in the midst of an unleashing civil war .	-5.5597
According to OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is now convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixing / recovery facilities mentioned by Syria and has seen its destruction . ”	-4.6424
That is why “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ”	-3.6834
Earlier this week , the inspectors had said they had completed the first round of inspections and visited 21 of 23 of the sites specified in Damascus .	-4.5047
Because of security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .	-2.7320
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites had been “ abandoned , ” according to what had been said , and that the existing objects in the chemical weapons programme had been transferred to other so-called facilities that were inspected . ”	-7.9777
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit OPCW inspectors .	-2.7521

Zorn ’ s verdict on the Bali	-4.0156
Trained and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 during the Bali bombing , have been angry about the ruling for the last of the penitentiary who was brought to justice since , in their view , Umar Patek should be shot shot legally .	-7.9388
Patek , who was in flight almost ten years as one of the most sought persons in Southeast Asia , was sentenced yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack to a imprisonment of 20 years .	-6.8640
He could be released after 15 years of prison .	-3.5000
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.2330
The condemnation also took place in a number of terrorist charges , involving a wave of explosive attack on churches in Indonesia on Christmas night in 2000 .	-5.5283
The Public Prosecutor had requested a life imprisonment even if it could have applied the death penalty for the man , who is also called the ' Demratisation man ' because of his reputation as a .	-6.7445
The decision attracted painful memories at June Corts , a mother of Perth , who lost her 39 years old twin daughters , Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Pat and his fellow servants nearly ten years ago .	-5.7917
She has been fighting hard to say that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-3.9088
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-2.8371
“ You should put him in front of a shooting command , ” said Coreen opposite AAP .	-8.0724
I have to live every day with no more grandsons and I will never see my daughters any more .	-3.9308

He died three months after the attack in Koma and “ died ” , while performing a life preservation system .	-4.8693
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the three other members of the Yemeni Islamiciah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samurra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and who were executed four years ago .	-5.4723
This type should really be given the death penalty before everyone else .	-3.3594
To let him live – no , there is no reason to let him live .	-4.3602
It is not much to get 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds .	-3.5746
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber to be tried .	-4.4046
He disintegrated nearly a decade of arrest , but eventually came up in January 2011 in Pakistan ’ s city of Abbottad , where US armed forces killed the former al-Qaida boss Osama bin Laden just four months later .	-5.1653
During the negotiation , an FMT agent said that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reconestablishing the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda .	-5.4435
“ He did not make himself ” , said Coreen .	-4.6492
Until recently , he showed no remorse of how much suffering he caused other people .	-3.4856
The verdict came before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year , which is celebrated with commemorative ceremony in Bali and Australia .	-3.8802
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Coreen .	-3.1608
Patek may appeal against his ruling .	-1.0789
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not have a mobile phone call )	-3.6319
Air passengers can now hear their electronic equipment for reading , work , games , music , and use the reputation of films , but not phone calls , the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-6.6311
However , passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.9793
As soon as they were implemented , off the airline , FAA staff Michael Huerta explained at a press conference .	-4.6720
The airlines must show that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline passenger and the rules governing the operation of the equipment according to the new rules .	-6.7544
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines that wish to expand the use of viable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.7895
They also included Delta and JetBlue .	-2.1659
“ Depending on the condition of the plan , we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic devices , ” the FAA announced in a briefing .	-4.3833
Currently , passengers with smartphones , tablets and other equipment have to be eliminated when the aircraft doors are closed .	-4.4185
You may not start them until the plane reaches three kilometers and the captain gives the green light .	-4.4707
When entering the landing flight , passengers must stop it again and not start it again before the plane has landed .	-4.9424
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic disruption may allow their passengers to use the equipment even at launch , landing , and on the roll field , the FAA explained .	-6.6297
Most new commercial aircraft and other pilots that have been retrofitted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.9662
Laura Gltrading , President of professional cabin crews , welcomed the changes .	-3.7899
“ If the new regulation is to be implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented Glucking .	-5.3490
Frankly , we are tired of having to feel tired about this issue .	-4.5573
Nevertheless , Internet connections to surfing , exchange emails , text messages , or download data under three kilometres remained forbidden , as explained by the authority .	-5.1269
Passengers are called on to put smart phones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .	-3.6492
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble similar online game played by the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines because he refused to shift the device while the plane was on the platform .	-5.2265
And heavier devices such as laptops must still be broken , as there is a risk of injury when flying through the cabin .	-4.6691
Mobile talks during the flight will continue to be prohibited .	-3.6122
Regulatory literacy for telephone conversations lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not at the FAA .	-2.7085
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic equipment when starting and landing .	-2.4774
Last month , Mark Rosenker , the National Transport Safety Board , said security experts for national transport issues on CBS News , Mobile phones would still be viewed as a risk .	-4.8959
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could cause potentially disturbances in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can also disrupt the transmitters , ” says Rosenker .	-6.0149
A Industry Advisory Committee , launched by the FAA to study this issue , recommended last month that the government take broader use of personal electronic devices .	-4.3088
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-2.6258
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire McCorll of Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for prohibition .	-4.3787
Restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of devices has become ubiquitous .	-4.6718
Some studies refer to the speech which , up to one third of passengers , forgets or ignored the departure of the device .	-5.3621
FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers after reports of disruptions in navigation and communications devices by passengers ’ UKW radios , which at that time showed the latest technology trend .	-6.7047
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed and approved by the FAA that they do not represent any kind of electronic interference .	-4.0862
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years when the flight height is reached .	-4.3798
The aircraft adapted to Wi systems are also more vulnerable to interference .	-4.2258
The overwhelming majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new guidelines , said Huerda .	-4.5337
Today ’ s electronic devices generally give much less wireless radiation than previous generations .	-2.9746
E-readers , for example , only give minimal radiation when shooting .	-2.6808
However , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.3838
Among the wary of loosening restrictions on device use by passengers is Amazon .	-4.4581
In 2011 , a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect .	-4.1460
Members of the FAA advisory committee shared mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.8819
Douglas Kidd , the National Association of Airline Passport , said that it believes that the equipment is genuine , even if the risk is minimal .	-6.1045
Other panel members said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who are in charge of aircraft systems being disrupted by the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-5.2217
The Committee recommended , however , that the IAA allow pilots to arrange the transfer of the equipment by passengers in poor conditions of vision .	-8.8185
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called it a sensible adjustment for travellers who would now be equipped with technology .	-7.6240
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-3.5225
As the air rescue service from the North Sea shipwreck , a fenced bird is released .	-7.4619
A bird , caught by air rescue service on the coast , which had been found in a North Sea pit , has been restored to nature again .	-7.2952
Water rallle was flown by a helicopter to Aberdeen last month , where it was rumored by the Scottish Animal Welfare Organization SPCA to rescue center in Alloa .	-5.5778
Colin Seddon , Head of the Centre , said : “ This water rallle was probably a winter rail shield from Northern Europe , held back by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-5.4979
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-3.6245
He added : “ He could not fly further , which is why we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-4.0574
When she was released , the water rallle was again fit and healthy .	-4.8103
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.3038
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those in Britain who care for prosperity and work want to change in our relations with the EU .	-4.5822
To this end , we commissioned the biggest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.4398
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders who form companies , sectors , and regions in the UK .	-5.2729
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.4882
We discovered that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe , focusing on countries that modernise and grow while the EU states stagnate .	-4.4416
They want new trade links from government side to countries such as China , India , and Brazil to be favored , instead of halting the long and exhausting process of reforming EU institutions .	-4.5173
In their view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster , from antitrust to product legislation .	-4.5584
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , as the companies ’ claims that the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies voted to be traditionally most pro-Europeans .	-6.5421
Finally , and most probably said , our survey by business leaders showed that a strong majority of Britain would like to see a course in the direction of the change of the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade .	-7.3597
This insight , which finds itself in companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change , ” which brings the trade journal back to Britain .	-5.3022
It is a matter of much – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would , at 16 % , lead to a change of opinion in favour of the retention of the EU in a referendum .	-5.0474
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership .	-2.9356
It also shows that companies expect a clear shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation .	-3.4993
A better deal for the UK economy is possible , and increasingly necessary , after the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union .	-5.7179
Priority must be employment and growth in the UK , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.4695
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to the pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new gas fura .	-3.4090
The construction start of the Southstream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects , the Gazprom Board explained .	-5.7618
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction of the Bulgarian section of the Southstream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.8974
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire continent of Europe .	-1.6591
South Stream is intended to provide Europe with more variety of export routes .	-3.9446
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where the majority of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , ensures that there is an increased risk in conventional routes , as the official one is told .	-6.5159
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks linked to transit countries are “ forever ” eliminated .	-3.0067
Bulgarian consumers get gas from South Stream at special rates when the whole project is in operation in 2015 .	-2.4608
According to Gazprom , work is to begin in other after ordered countries on the planned route at the end of the year .	-4.4265
The pipeline is supplied with natural gas at an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres .	-3.4574

In the UK , the plus was only 6 % , and in France at 19 % .	-3.0895
" Properties offer an attractive discount " , said Ulbrich .	-3.5234
The yield distance between real estate and federal bonds is at historically high levels .	-3.8560

Consultation of the Royal Commission : Two YiMCA employees accused of allegations against Jonathan Lord for sex offenses .	-4.6591
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSG ) were accused of sex offenses relating to children , before in 2011 allegations were made against the children ’ s infamous Lord of Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for the sexual abuse of children .	-6.8651
But in the opening statement to the Commission , the YMCA stated that “ the organization never had an incident of sexual abuse of children . ”	-5.4674
Managing director Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YAMCA employee was charged with child pornography offences , and another in which a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 was sentenced for abuse of confidential children .	-5.9088
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission 's assistants , that he knew of the first case but did not recognise the second .	-3.9788
He acknowledged that the opening declaration by the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “ there have been external reviews of the YMCA , in which YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety . ”	-5.7899
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-4.8558
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the Executive Board refused to leave Lord from me , and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety directives .	-6.0553
Lord was condemned to twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA .	-4.7906
He has been sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.7900
Hare disputed , however , that YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting violations of children 's safety .	-4.5770
The staff said they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , caring for them privately as baby sitters , sitting on his lap , said that he was comfortable , and that children were playing with his mobile phone .	-7.1207
Daniele Ockwell , whose superior Lord was and who asked for a training to protect children because it was concerned about his behavior , said that the children ’ s service leader Jacqui Barnat , who was the superiors in the YMCA Caringbah , was “ very lously and most of the time very unpalatable . ”	-9.2905
The director explained that he would not accept statements from employees who would not have dared to report back to their superiors .	-5.4084
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord affected their judgment , which was why they did not report it .	-4.6296
Hare explained that he told the Executive Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “ Jonathan-Lord incident ” was “ not the filing ” by employees , and the Board agreed to it .	-6.5706
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secret obligations was made shortly after the allegations were made , whether by the director of the children ’ s services of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-5.4605
He said that it was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence , but this was done “ over-anxious ” and badly .	-5.0766
YMCA NSW , when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , was not a safe organisation for children , Professor Stephen Smallbone explained by Griffith University , an expert on sexual abuse , the Commission .	-8.6824

Since its resignation in June 2007 , after a decade of head of government , Blair has largely avoided making a statement on British politics , and his comments tend to be limited to foreign policy and his role as the Quartet ’ s anchor for peace in the Middle East .	-6.5030

When the hordes were influenced in charen in Cardiff to empower the year ’ s horse , they knew that a tough competitive battle was in place .	-7.2051
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-4.1264
The Knirp , which is not even in the nursery and only a few months ago has taken its first steps , and his Shetland Pony Toffee was quietly trashed by the three rounds and took the first prize – with 30 adult opponents behind it .	-8.2268

And Toffee received top praise for his appearance and personality .	-5.1758
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and since ever had been treating with the Shetland Pony .	-4.3693
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great listener . ”	-1.6009
They had to compete against the entire seating field and went out of place at Goldpokal and Rosette .	-6.0066

He ran on sand the entire length of the Arena and although he was so tiny he did fantastic work .	-4.4581
Fenton is mad for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farm farms , and has two chickens to take care of .	-3.9935
As it is started , it will not take long until it is on the " horse of the year " – and I am sure it will be performing well .	-4.6241

Together they are a great team .	-3.1883
The jury rated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten and presented in the lead ring .	-4.1971

A Chinese newspaper called “ Reform ”	-3.8682
A Chinese newspaper , which on the front page called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation to be reformed , declared a press regulatory . the of , , and .	-7.5024
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-3.0625
But Chen later released on television that he had adopted bribes to falsify reports of a partial state-owned company .	-4.1415
Now the New Express is going to undergo a “ comprehensive recapitulation , ” the regulator explained .	-3.5979
The “ Rebinders Order ” was issued by the authority of press and publications , radio , film and television in Guangdong .	-5.1366
Recent inquiries have shown that the New Express , which is part of the Yaneng Evolving News Group , published several inaccurate reports about the listed company zoom up between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-7.3869
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disordered , ” the regulator announced in a statement .	-4.1948
She said he decided to “ impose a administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and remove his reporting license . ”	-4.1486

After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and turned behind his journalistic work .	-3.6261
But then Che spread out in state television and said he had published false reports against payment .	-4.7083
“ In this case , I damaged zoom lion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he explained to the CCTV public news channel .	-5.0856
I did it primarily because I was out of money and glory .	-1.9990
I realise that I have done wrong .	-3.4056
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express released an apology on the front page and declared that it failed to properly check the reports .	-3.9035
Several well-known suspects have recently taken place on television networks .	-2.3813

discovered drug tunnel with its own railway between the US and Mexico .	-3.0166
One of the most sophisticated tunnel for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was entirely equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway operations , has now been discovered .	-4.4855
The US authorities described the 120x90 centimetres tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .	-4.2985
The tunnel , which runs in Zickzag patterns over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouse halls close to Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-4.2980
In the area there are countless unvisible bearing halls , making it easier to hide with drug-bearing trucks .	-4.9185
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be stolen in it , the authorities said .	-7.4846
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , as were the records of the court .	-4.0889
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged with the property and the intended sale of Marijuana and cocaine .	-4.0912
They threaten prison sentences between ten years and for life if they are guilty .	-4.2090
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers set up an extensive subterranean network of drains tunnels .	-3.7133
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered since 2006 in San Diego .	-1.9427
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which presents drug cartels with the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers .	-5.3480
In 2010 , the authorities found a short 640 meter long passage with rails , which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-6.6593

Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their pastoral Flynn was born .	-3.1407
Veganism is a vegetarian company , according to Lexica , but differs in a very significant way .	-5.6627
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of Sahel , ice or a strong Edmer , these “ scissors ” are not on the menu of a Vegan .	-6.9158
Milk , cheese , egg , besides the absence of meat and fish , the vegans can drop off from all consumption of animal products - honey is no .	-5.8371
What remains , however , may be asked , but a closer look reveals the vegan nutrition world with a remarkable resourcefulness .	-5.7337
" Brotaufstriche are very popular " , says Utte Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , who owns a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.2979
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the Domgasse .	-3.8615
For 13 years he lives a native New Zealand vegan , he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I put my nutrition around and became vegetarian .	-5.2984
Around the turn of the century then took the next step and I became a vegan .	-2.5891
" But the conviction was not only because of the diet but also because of the shoe selection " , says Proctor , the leather in the normal leather .	-7.7739
He recognized that it also goes in other everyday aspects without animal products .	-4.1427
More importantly , vegan is an ethical issue .	-4.2274
" I do not want animals to die for me " , " Proctor talks about the maxim of the vegans that stretches across the entire consumer behaviour .	-4.7167
Instead of brothers , bakers or rubber-bears leaving behind , the vegans quickly discovered new products that became enthusiastic .	-6.4499
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " actually represents no withdrawal , no Askese is , but it is an enrichment " .	-5.9678
And precisely these conditionality also caused some well-intentioned attempt to fail .	-4.6189
" The search factor is a very important factor that allows many people to give up quickly , just like smoking , " Proctor does a comparison .	-7.0849
And turn to " certain tastes are not fixed at the animal " .	-4.7996
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-2.6160
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " clarifies the vegans .	-4.1946
Proctor can be used for instance Auberginen , Champignons and a couple of Vegans .	-7.4748
It pays attention to a balanced and diversified diet , which is to be tasty once and for all .	-5.9870
Of course , we want to have something between the teeth ; that is legitimate .	-4.5132
" It should be delicious , but this is not just to reduce animal food , " said actor .	-5.7068
However , there was no such thing as that of course .	-9.2584
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.2270
I do not accept foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin ratio .	-3.6762
There are high-performance athletic activities which only feed vegan .	-3.9264
" My blood values are excellent , I am often in check " , informs Promtor .	-7.5184
In particular , against the lack of vitamin B12 , many vegansimus critics warn . are , , , , , and , ,	-4.3530
" Since animals are fed with animal feed rather than graying on the bark , it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the refrigerator is the vitamin B12 proportion " is present Proctor .	-7.3782
For vegans it is also possible to take the encoding in the form of tablets .	-3.7902
" My B12 values are fine " , he explains .	-2.2966
Large paths should not be allowed to become a Proctor for food procurement .	-5.1531
Basic foodstuffs are finally found everywhere and every supermarket has soya milk and other products .	-4.0091
I find everything I need on the ground .	-2.5220
I only purchase and buy something special .	-3.7822
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but this is what we know about " ordinary " finished products .	-4.5013
Ohnev is a much cheaper and less time-consuming preparation of vegan dishes than is commonly believed .	-6.2215
" There is a lot to discover with the house kitchen , with a few small tups you can get good , if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-7.6976
Proctor was able to bring its female pimples to a location .	-8.7324
The Vegan family has a new flavour .	-5.2932
It is dynamic , if we combine , that is a new priority .	-5.4351
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves " says Proctor .	-3.7288
He was , of course , already sceptical .	-3.1390
Don 't miss my meal any more ?	-3.2023
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if you have questions like this , you must act as a vegan with a sense of fingers .	-6.2538
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be an Enklendida term .	-6.2227
And , more accurately , everyday life does not seem as distant as imagined , and the Vegan does not seem to be so restricted in everyday life as in general .	-8.4780
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.1884
Pommes are everywhere !	-2.2455
" Many Döner shops offer folding tables or just a vegetarian Yufka " , says Proctor .	-5.4028
In a pizzeria it differs from pastagebead , or just ordered a pizza without cheese , all a question of habits .	-5.4376
The restaurant is so slow on the ground .	-3.4420
" When I started to eat myself myself a little more difficult than 13 years ago , the New Zealand countries can find a development : " We have to talk to the people to point them out " .	-7.7084
" If there is enough demand , they may be inclined to add the menu " , he hopes .	-4.0409
Vegane restaurants develop , for example , the combarse in Mannheim or the café Birthfree .	-6.4209
Proctor wishes other restaurants to have a vegan menu at least .	-4.3677
In fact , vegan dishes are available for all .	-3.0065
Everybody can eat it , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.5926
" Meat courts are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others " , is determined by actor .	-5.4779
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the most of the allergic part impossible from the outset " says Proctor .	-4.5832
At the beginning , however , the buyout products can be somewhat difficult .	-6.0457
In particular , if you learn to understand which animal additives in earth can include as a colour donor , then it seems that following the ethics of so many hurdles and traps , you will quickly have the courage to leave .	-8.9866
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients involved in food and also cleaning products .	-5.0245
" After and after we develop a scanner and know which signs and logos you have to respect , " It is sometimes better to do small steps than to fail or fail to listen to , " says Proctor .	-8.0421
Veganism , it is an important moral pointer that beats awareness .	-2.1853
Perhaps he does not entirely create that one should read his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critically .	-4.7303
The trading agent Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in the process .	-5.3170
The trading at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time .	-2.8828

The other eleven US option markets , including two of Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.1820
The recent incident continues a series of smaller and larger breakdown among the operators .	-4.1188
Only on Tuesday were the indices of Nasdaq had not been calculated for hours because of errors in the data .	-4.8612

British police is to extradite Assange .	-6.7942
The British police today handed over a extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian message in London and asked for asylum .	-3.6799
Scotland Yard explained that a 40-year-old Australians sent a “ invitation to face ” that asked him to appear in a police guard , and added , if he did not , he threatened him to arrest .	-7.4831
Assange has threatened to extradite Sweden for the charge of a sexual offence following the use of its British law applications since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-6.3746
Given his fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the United States , he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.3112
Scotland Yard has “ sent a 40-year-old man a call to face a police guard at a time chosen by us . ”	-8.7922
He continues to violate the conditions of his release .	-3.0415
The message was not a comment on the delivery of the police call .	-3.1777

A Tax on Foreign Property Owners against London ’ s Illumination bubble	-4.5587
The Treasury has calculated the CGI measure on a provisional basis , but is still awaiting the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who , in the 2012 budget , had imposed a 7 % Stamping Tax on apartments costing more than GBP 2 million , and annual charges for buyers holding apartments as a company and not as individuals .	-7.5693
Already , revenues from the Stamping Tax for residential property are up in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which were at <unk> 708 million in the 2012 / 13 tax year , revenue for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the Northeast , Yorkshire and the Humber region combined .	-10.9979
Cook said : “ According to the increases in the stamping tax on highly priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against a change , it is difficult to claim that high quality homes are too low , regardless of the impact of the obsolete municipal tax system . ”	-8.0096
“ But this step could induce some foreign investors to persist in buying real estate in London , or prevent owners from selling it , ” he added .	-4.3165

Scientists could shed more light on the context in which a dog ’ s winch is associated with his mood .	-5.4023
Earlier research showed that happy dogs with the tail tended to lay more on the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nervous dogs were the left side . and are . are , , , and , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.1292
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtleties .	-2.1696
Professor Georgio Vallorcausa , a neuroscientist of the University of Trento , said : “ At human level , it is well known that the left and right brain split react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-5.9330
Here we tried to look at this with other species .	-2.7036
He also noticed that , as with humans , the right brain split is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two slaves played different roles in feelings .	-5.6395
To learn more about how dogs respond to the side rabbits of their art , researchers watched the animals while those other dogs saw themselves .	-6.0242
It dimensions the heart rate of the four-legged patients and analysed the behavior .	-3.3723
We probably will soon understand why the tail moves in one direction or the other .	-3.8002
Professor Vallorcausa said : “ We have shown to the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate other aspects , and we have been able to control the movement of tails more towards the left or right . ”	-8.0564
When the animals looked like an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the stray dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-5.4140
But since the fluctuation was mainly on the left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the wedelt ) , their heart rate rose and they looked dry .	-6.3100
In the opinion of Professor Vallorto and husband , the dogs do not communicate with each other by means of these movements .	-7.3201
It is rather convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should be concerned and when not .	-4.4259
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and the winding relationship with the tail is rather associated with friendly behavior , and the right side produces less friendly behavior , you are reacting on the basis of this experience . ”	-7.7455
Researchers say that the insights of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to improve understanding of the emotions of their animals .	-4.8241
John Bradshaw , an expert for dog behaviour and guest stipendiads at the Faculty of Animal Welfare of the University of Bristol stated that this was not the first study investigating whether the left and right is important for dogs .	-5.0390
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they view an aggressive dog and turn right when they are a satisfied dog .	-4.4456
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was that “ dogs tend to go to a robotic dog if their tail “ leaves left and is not left , rather than becoming calm – exactly the opposite than in the Italian study . ”	-8.4063
According to his statement , the differences could therefore stir , that in the various studies dogs do not interpret animals in films or robot dogs as dogs .	-5.4619
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help explained .	-2.6298
“ Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain chambers are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” so Bradshaw .	-5.2088
But as their behavior simply draws attention , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-5.0094

Pope Francis IV received the first Cardinal in February .	-3.8198
Pope Francis was appointed the Catholic Church on 22 February for the first time , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-4.2979
Cardinal Leamines are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor .	-6.6151
There are currently 201 Cardinal channels .	-3.4564
However , a Cardinal , who reaches an age of 80 , can no longer take part in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible fundamental ” .	-5.6025
In a statement where the news was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman for the Vatican , said that there would be a meeting of all the Cardinal channels before the ceremony was held for the appointment of the new Cardinal channels , also known as a Constituent Board .	-7.3495
“ Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the Constitutional Board in February in advance , so that other meetings that require World War Crimes could be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-5.9083
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that until February , the number of eligible cardinal channels would probably have declined .	-4.4184
He explained that a Pope would normally call as many cardinal lines as necessary , so that the number of electoral channels entered 120 again , and so many cardinal channels over 80 , as he would like .	-8.7335
The Board of Directors next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Valero .	-3.8280
At present there is a certain overhang on the side of Europe , and in particular Italy .	-3.5394
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint Cardinal channels from the rest of the world to restore equilibrium , ” he said .	-3.3956
Fifty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of Cardinal citizens .	-3.3063
The Charlemagne will also be the first to call the Cardinal Council , formed since the formation of Francis , a group of eight cardinal schools around the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the church .	-7.8569
In the past , the Pope chose everything alone .	-1.9707
“ Now Francis has selected these eight elementary channels to help him , ” said Valero .	-3.5826
He said that it was “ good possible ” that Francis called the Cardinal counsel .	-5.4071
But we have not been able to do so – that is all new .	-3.3435
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called to cardinal from large places , but Francis has “ full of surprises – so we do not know whom to appoint . ”	-6.0816

Desperate a Obama-Votes	-3.9303
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible .	-1.9661
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts that have been thwarted by the Republican blocking tactics .	-2.9863
The blocking policy does not excite the site ’ s problems of Obamacare , the drone attacks .	-3.8064
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what could have been possible .	-2.1901
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second-year student at Harvard Medical School .	-1.7675
I read a sad book at the moment .	-2.2483
It is a book of which I believed it would give me hope during the troubled second year of my medical profession .	-7.9470
It is called “ The Auda City to Win ” and portrays the memoir Barack Obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .	-3.8167
In the evening , when I am ready to deal with my patients ' practices and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics allowed millions of inspiration and speeches to get rid of their breath .	-7.4848
The election was cast into a landslide victory and the news spokesmen held to face the historic importance of this hour .	-6.4886
My classmates weaned with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .	-2.5767
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.0306
When Obama changed office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval values .	-2.3607
And then I close the book .	-1.3744
Switch back on the present is a malicious awakening , as if one is taken from a dream .	-4.3042
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.2661
In the years since I first made my vote , something has actually changed .	-3.0881
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.2701
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , ranging from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act on Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-4.1222
I , too , believe that the party political blocking tactics have bolstered too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health care and the Guantanamo Bay closure , to name just a few .	-5.8253
But , having defended the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances countless times , I ended my attempt to explain .	-5.1710
I have achieved a point of political despair .	-1.5718
The Republican blocking policy cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to listen to or kill innocent children by drones overseas .	-3.9705
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ private lives and why whistleblowers are being punished , disclose government failures .	-4.7670
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awoki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , and why public funding and spending ceilings are evaded during the presidential election .	-4.7137
It does not justify the results of a report that says that the White House ’ s efforts to ensure a good balance of media are the most “ aggressive since the Nixon government . ”	-5.8194
And rejuvenate cannot excuse the inability to design a simple site in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was adopted .	-4.2397
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected .	-1.7825
Whether I should have understood with 18 would mean that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns .	-5.6449
Obviously , the Office of Representatives is not a predictable course , because an opposition party and random events like the Newoven massacre shape public debate .	-5.2127
But if I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.1555
And that disturbs me most .	-2.0373
I was re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-3.7162
Mitt Romney was a confused and unbalanced alternative , he didn ’ t seem to be able to set his direction and positions .	-3.8348
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would meet the hope that we had heard for so long .	-3.0795
But , with Obama ’ s approval values at less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become so tougher by this book .	-4.5048
It gives me the longing for the many promises that have dissipated into air .	-3.8052
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama needed to cover a serious loss against Clinton in the pre-election in Pennsylvania .	-3.7314

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abobott had conflict of interest with parental leave .	-2.6707
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abobott would be in a conflict of interests with his plans for parental leave , because his mothers could become pregnant and therefore benefit .	-5.6326
The tycoon , who is in a jurisdiction over the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , claimed that when he wanted to wipe out questions , he would be in conflict .	-6.2952
The Palmer United Party could control up to four Senate votes that are important to decide whether carbon and mining taxes will be cut or reduced .	-6.6795
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott 's daughters would personally benefit from the laws .	-3.4226
“ He is in a great conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his pregnant daughters becomes a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , ” he said Palmer .	-5.5392

Why do we not have a system where you march in , enter the data into a computer , select immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-5.7551
Palmer also criticised the use of lead lead pins on the map .	-5.6097
Do you use it because you can execute the results if you don 't like them ?	-3.9507
It is unbelievable to vote with lead breeds today .	-5.4117

RBS suspended two Forex traders	-2.9071
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two merchants from its foreign exchange department , so two people familiar with the situation ; this is another sign that the world ’ s regulatory approach to the alleged manipulation of the currency market is fast approaching .	-7.0604
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and RBS , confirmed that they are working with the authorities to carry out investigations in the world ’ s largest financial market , where US $ 5.3 trillion in annual financial transactions are .	-6.1234
The two retailers would be the first RBS-employees to be suspended in the expanding investigation that is taking up the scandal about the Libor Inter-Bank .	-6.3133
The Bank , which did not comment on the conciliations , confirmed this month that it received requests for information from authorities .	-4.2084
“ Our inquiries on this matter go further and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-3.1033
Last month , the situation announced that RBS sent the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a former merchant to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Statement Authority .	-4.1939

UBS announced this week that she took steps against some of its workers , following the Swiss regulatory authority Finma explained that it looked at a alleged manipulation of the currency market in a number of Swiss banks .	-5.9375
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently considering allegations that bankers are to have agreed on transactions in the currency market .	-5.2364
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan , and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said with the situation of trusted persons .	-3.8084
Banks emulated messages and emails from several years of misbehavior .	-5.1498
The news about these investigations has sent traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies limits speculators ’ opportunities .	-5.4239
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.7567
A leading trader noted that , despite the massive daily volume in foreign exchange , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks means of “ being able to influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-6.2679
The news came out on the same day , when Credit Suisse announced that she fired a London Exchange Traded Funds Office trader this week after he had caused a loss of nearly $ 6 million by the end of last year .	-5.4079

However , that did not detract from the action of some 20 members of the citizens ' initiative .	-3.6990
Their motto on the big poster was " We are against construction ruins " .	-3.2386
She wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .	-5.9440
In conversation with many passers-by to the construction site , it became clear that some citizens believe that the achievement of the city 's project will go many better , although few have the same questions in the dimension of the project presented as the BI .	-7.4730
But they are beginning to resist , because the city continues to hesitate , the BI says .	-4.5989
As was said , public statements by the mayor also seem to be working .	-5.5016
In May , the Municipal Council meeting said that it was feared of the thermal baths , if the public were to vote against the plans for a spa and wellness complex on Swiss meadow .	-6.5234

After the skirmish , Schmidt himself would not have had contact with his colleague .	-6.0671
I do not know why .	-1.7903

This basic idea had already existed in 1913 .	-3.2853
After several years of debate , the Town Council finally adopted the EUR 5 million kroner ( around EUR 615 000 ) expensive project .	-3.9228

Post leaned scarcely Sundays	-3.4369
" Many citizens will not have noticed that the red points for Sunday leaf are still in different letterboxes of the core city and the districts , but read the small paper to the yellow purse of post AG , you will quickly find that there is no more space on Sundays and public holidays , " the German Federal DP shares with it .	-20.4528
A FDP question has confirmed this .	-3.0947
On Sundays and public holidays only in front of the post building in the gravity of the road 36 and in the Jakobscher Strasse 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-6.0693
Whether it is still used in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP question .	-4.1318
The FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , the Socialist and Youth political spokesman , wants to argue here .	-6.1008
Sunday printing is an important postoffice .	-3.7294
" This undertaking , despite the increase in prices for letters in January 2013 , would radically and unreasonable " .	-4.9957
Thomas Bittner , Liberal Group Chairman , supports his group colleagues : " What annoys me is the fact that here , surreptitiously , we will change or even delete the space .	-7.9720
The post office is a far cry from the citizens .	-3.3661
" At least the stamp boxes in the New Castle and Rosengarten districts will have to be closed again on Sundays , " said Bittner and Röhrenbeck .	-7.1214
Also for the core city , especially non-mobile fellow citizens , a desk with Sunday orientation should also be within walking distance .	-5.9153
In the town hall , Röhrenbeck asked whether the city council is planning talks with the post office on this matter .	-6.4199
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with lamp .	-2.9160

Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more expensive .	-3.1050
This morning , the Municipality of the city advises on a presentation of Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-5.6397
Thus , parking fees should be increased by 50 percent .	-3.3219
This is not to increase prices , but to reduce the time interval from car parks and parking slots from 30 to 20 minutes .	-6.0808
In December , the Town Council will have to decide .	-3.3463
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt maintains this ' for no good idea ' .	-3.5232
Parking is a little too expensive for smaller dealers .	-6.3659
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is " quite reasonable and , in fact , long overdue " .	-4.8774

With a small cader , the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudident had to compete in the Schirler SchulTournament in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb .	-6.9676
The elders were with an experienced team on the other side of the net .	-3.0562

They provided a hard-fought hour two-match .	-3.3536
Nerosity on both sides caused errors and punctuality , especially in the case of the ball taking ; even on the passports , the precision was sometimes poor and in some critical game scenes prevented the overwhelming attention to potential point gains .	-9.4457
In this high-performance , well-balanced meeting , Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team consistently agreed the great physical effort and a warm commitment of both teams .	-7.0902

According to Triukait , the tourist destination of the wide viewing area is marked by the goal of receiving the already growing old Allmenweidfeld with its special protected living room types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures .	-11.4321
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grasshopper , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.9664
You need these free connections to inward design .	-4.0181
Triukait said that she would not miss the opportunity to break a lance for the planned spherical fission .	-6.2650
In this planning , the current measure will not only be seamlessly integrated .	-3.6343
A biospherical area also offers the opportunity to achieve sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and therefore a continuous addition to the Life Project as well as the existing nursing days for the future .	-7.7440
Following these different statements , Remembrance Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bishop admitted the help in groups .	-6.4999

Egypt ’ s Last freely elected President	-1.9281
Mohammed Morsi places his mark , but his day of triumphs should not mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes .	-4.2067
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the first freely elected president of the country , thus leading the succession of Hosni Mubarak , who had previously been ousted from office for 16 months .	-4.9789
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth leader since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-6.6940

Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi met in a small autoconvoi shortly after 11 p.m.	-5.6958
Just a few hundred supporters had assembled before the court to celebrate the new president , and , unlike the presidential pardon from Mubarak ’ s era , the traffic was only temporary to allow autoconvoi to cross the typically animated road linking the city centre with southern suburbs .	-8.0542
As a dishonorable “ substitute wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and Friday speech , which he presented not only as the candidate of the Islamists , but all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak presidency .	-6.4003
“ Egypt today is a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the Mursi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , told the judges in the wood-stricken chamber where he was sworn in .	-5.7423

The next Ecumenical Forum on Monday , 21 October , the New Museum of the Castle , is about the subject of " The hell with hell - Theological considerations about the way we deal with the last things " .	-6.6760
Reference is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.9511
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of Catholic and Protestant church communities Salem , the Salem Castle and the Culinary Bodensee Region .	-4.2304
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate the question in the forum , as today the people are recording the " last things " after death .	-5.0693
If people had known too much of it over the past centuries , putting on the pictures of heaven and hell , ' which until now defines our ideas ' , the contemporary prophetic teaching of hopes for perfection was more of a certain embarrassment or even linguistic impotence .	-7.7105
" The greater hope has been dashed by Christian and Christian critique " , the referent says .	-5.1393
You gave us ' with so many question marks that the exclamation sign seems to have been lost . '	-4.9617
Johanna Rahner goes on saying : " But the critical challenge remains the anger of death . "	-3.9500
Hence the question of the longing for " who dream of being good at the end of the day " .	-4.2872

At the Ladies it was Theresa Duelli from the team nightmare that made it top on the podium .	-4.7540
On the square two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen .	-2.8746
A good development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community .	-3.2253
Not only in terms of power , the whole range of athletes was represented .	-3.7465
The ages were also ten years old with the youngest and more than 70 years of age .	-6.1857
In the main races this year were even more absolute TopBs on the start .	-4.9573
Four drivers were able to take advantage of the local drivers .	-4.1876

The winner gets $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.1545
For 21 years , Georges Bwave saw how his sick father repeatedly lost his consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-5.6792
Jamef Bwave was injured in a car accident in 1981 near Yaounde , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.6915
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematoom there that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-5.3845
“ There were no neurons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwave .	-4.3660
We would have sent him out of Cameroon if we had the money .	-2.7190
Instead , Bwave spent years helping his father through filled hospitals and hospitals to receive the treatment they had to offer .	-4.2353
“ It ’ s not easy ” to comment Bwave .	-3.1644
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not first .	-3.7791
There are many patients .	-1.2258
Some people are dying even because they have to wait .	-2.1046
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles died in 2002 .	-2.1140
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , the World Health Organization .	-3.9837
In contrast , the ratio in the United States is a doctor for 413 people .	-3.3213
But even if there was a doctor , most Cameroon ’ s visit could not be .	-3.2353
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three quarters of health spending in the country are private .	-2.7754
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-1.5310
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.9227
His father , and so many of his compatriots suffer , made the decision to do something about it in Bwave .	-5.0033
Dr. Georges Bwave and his volunteer team have carried out 700 free operations last year .	-3.6084
He was a doctor himself and works as a surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaounde .	-3.2530
In addition , he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-7.4240
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped nearly 32,000 people .	-1.7098
Almost every Friday , children are forced into small buses and drive with snow-covered medical equipment on the roof over an elevated terrain to the villages that need help .	-7.9176
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-2.0758
More than once , they had to delay the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-3.3740
But when they arrive , they will be received like heroes : a feast meal , singing and dancing and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.9243
In these villages , free medical care really is a reason to celebrate and Bwave – with its broad smile and limitless energy – is happy to meet the joyful celebration .	-5.6682
The next morning , the team will begin to investigate hundreds of patients .	-3.4776
“ We handle 500 people per trip , ” said Bwave .	-4.3249
They come from a radius of 60 kilometers to the village – on foot .	-4.5048
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-3.3881
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-2.0435
Others get cruisers , lost eyeglasses or free birth customers – a document that is necessary for the school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-5.5101
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with a local anesthesia .	-3.0496
The operations usually take place in a school , town hall or flat ; after the surgery patients are on and go into the recreation area to make space for their neighbors .	-5.8085
Lighting for the OP and the disinfectant is fed by the generator of the group , working Bwave and its volunteers until the early hours of the morning .	-5.8547
It is an exhausting Pensum , but the village musician usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.3784
" You drums all night , so that we can stay awake and continue our work " says Bwave .	-4.5769
On Sunday the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.6034
The group – a mixture of camera doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with its work it makes a huge difference to the people who help it .	-6.1340
A man explained that the free operation of a bar brush he has received is now enabling him to work again .	-3.9708
“ That changes the future of my family , ” the man thought .	-2.6071
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwave also works in private clinics in Yaounde .	-4.8389
This second job grants 60 % of non-profit-making activity , says BWave ; the rest of them come from private donations .	-5.8501
“ I really don ’ t know when he is sleeping , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who is studying the Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine in the second year and is working voluntarily in Bwelles Group .	-5.1582
He is always in hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-3.0327
For medical and health care students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe , and who support Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-5.1058
“ We can be involved in operations where we help out blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwave , ” says O 'Malley .	-4.4147
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.6460
Students usually pay for their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring about often donated sanitary material .	-6.8552
Once in Yaounde , Bwave takes care of accommodation , transport and guidance .	-4.1549
“ He is definitely a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.3655
He is devoting his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no boundaries .	-3.5868
For Bwave , almost constant work is not a burden .	-3.4482
To help others to live a happy life and to fulfil a promise that he gave to his father , gives him great pleasure .	-5.0139
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwave .	-2.8177
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.0071
I hope he will see what I am doing .	-1.3020
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-3.2492

The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , Horst Janson is cut to the body .	-3.6322
Janson himself is an old shoe in his wit , acting .	-3.9851
The old man , Santiago , cannot imagine fishing .	-3.9213
So the two are just great supplements .	-5.1380
It is almost meant to be able to see the wrinkles in the Nacks of the old man , of which the fisherman ’ s young mango speaks .	-6.1499
When Santiago tired of life is sitting on the chair , that 's true with Janson .	-3.4086
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is notable for his character role .	-4.6746
Hemingway explained the story of a warrior , a courageous man who does not stand up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his will .	-4.9308
Janson is a single star on stage in long distance .	-4.9639
He manages to focus the public ’ s attention on himself , so that his monologues are not boring at a .	-5.0899
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue lit water bottles .	-4.9707
Director Jens Hasselmann wishes to take the old man to the fishing village .	-3.4889
In the course of the performance , he puts the active scene into light : the Hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who hails with her songs and her wonderful voice the sensation of life of Cuba .	-6.6703

Tourism : Deserence to the Romans	-6.2303
About 120 meters in length a Roman sewage channel is received below Cologne .	-5.2694
If you are visiting Cologne the cathedral is not over .	-4.1703
Around 157 meters , the two towers stood in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-4.0528
But only a few visitors who visit the two filigrees of church houses have a sense that there is also a lot to discover under the Cathedral .	-6.9444
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the subject of Cologne Unterwelt .	-2.9161
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Köln-Tourism directly on the cathedral .	-3.4737
The tour starts quite spectacular : " We are going to an underground car park " , says Schulze .	-4.7770
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted to be an auto-righteous city , and that is why the remainder of the old city wall was only what was not too big .	-7.1032
The majority of the car park ’ s users therefore now also ride past the Roman ruins and only move their cars away .	-7.8533
But if you look closer , you will find an archaeological site separated by metal debris in the parkdeck D2 .	-6.7888
About five meters high ruins of hand-hung stone are worth seeing .	-6.4469
" It is the remnants of the Roman wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " narrates schoolchildren .	-4.7652
Before going back to the daylight , the participants at the top park level can still take a look at the dark , 15 metres deep .	-6.6921
This is the well of the old dome , which is unfortunately hardly noticed .	-3.5613
Next stop of the Round is the precursor , and here the participants descend to the deep .	-5.3839

And the preeminent is the former Sabbath palace , the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine .	-4.6256
From the front of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which has been preserved here at around 120 metres .	-5.5712

After coming to the cashier , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , walk-in chess .	-5.1897
" We are now in Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.9114
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to come to the ground which was essential for ritual washing .	-4.5206
Until today , at the lower end of Mikwe , the origin of which dates back to the eighth century , different water stands can be traced by alternating peak of the Rhine .	-5.4362
Mikus will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square for which the construction works will begin shortly .	-5.7644
