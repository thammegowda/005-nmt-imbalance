While China becomes more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI-practitioner who worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-3.5256
These demands arose after members of the US administration made pronouncements about AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-4.0394
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-3.0414

On Sunday , the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change their name in the Republic of northern Macedonian , a step that would resolve a decade-long conflict with Greece , which had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-4.8857
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a territorial claim to the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.4727
The two governments closed an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the amendment would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slavic majority population of Macedonia .	-3.0170
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and , in the face of a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the result will create the 50-percentage barrier , which is a prerequisite for the referendum ’ s validity .	-5.9789
The question of voting on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-3.0273
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing to include in institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.1622

Before the House in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and chairs before the tents laid down by those who are going to boycott the referendum .	-4.7977
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads up , not through the door , " said Kavadarkov .	-4.4806
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.8564
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.0523
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.1166
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” said Zaev after handing over his voice .	-4.3341
According to him , the result of ‘ yes ’ would be a “ guarantee of our future . ”	-3.6932

Then he left a pass and passed to death .	-2.6662
The English striker used his first contact to play the ball back in Agüero , who then shot with right – past Brighton-Torsige Mathew Ryan on the right side of the door .	-6.4199

Since the national hero had been excluded from the PlayOffer license , there was not much reason to force another start .	-4.8105
But the hard battle Scherzer hoped to stand up on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still play offs for the Rockies that have a lead from a game ahead of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the West .	-6.0662
The Rockies secured at least one place in the first league with a 5 : 2 victory over the national on Friday evening , but the title won is still not secure .	-5.3913

In the communication for the East Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday , it says : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-6.5768
Most of my time in the eight years as a Labour MEP , the GCC meeting on Friday evening was exactly the same .	-4.6693
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , more relaxed ' policy is long forgotten if it ever started .	-4.9772
It has become increasingly clear that different views on the Labour Party are not tolerated , and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-4.6577
This started shortly after Mr Jeremys ’ departure , because colleagues with whom I had previously thought I would have a similar political attitude , expected me to turn back and take positions that I would never have agreed with , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-8.0892
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a drift of abuse in the social media , which calls for rejection , denounces the centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-6.6060
This experience has not just been made .	-3.3412
I do know , in fact , that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues , as the comments that are directed towards me tend to be political .	-4.9360
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are exposed every day to a flood of sexual or racial abuse , but never shy away .	-3.2045

I have received plenty of advice over the last two years to take my neck , not to be so vocal , and then I would be “ order . ”	-5.2924
But for this reason I have not come to politics .	-2.4437

Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s Captain Rory Hughes who was given to the game of Warren , allowed Melrose to give figures , and Jason Baggot to take an unrelated attempt .	-13.0789
Climo stretched out Ayr ’ s lead with a crash in order to reach a match straight into the middle of the day , and then to take a solo tour that succeeded him in the 17 : 5 Paul ’ s lead for Ayr .	-9.6812
Melrose , however , started the second half well , and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to turn from Baghat reduced the backlog to five points .	-5.1150

Ryder Cup in 2018 : The United States team is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday ’ s ingles .	-4.7605
After three unilateral meetings , the Fourth Games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-4.6223
The swing is a free sporting concept that players have missed , especially in competitions like this .	-4.8586
So where would they say is the momentum now ?	-1.7252
“ You had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so there is some momentum , ” said Jordan , when he went back for the day . ”	-5.0841
Of course , Europe is in the advantage of 4 points of lead , 12 more are still to be played .	-4.0385
The Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails and there was a lot of encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played the whole day together and have three of four points each .	-6.3903
From the beginning , the Spith was superior and set an example .	-5.4944
This jolly julie was louder than his hand goes on , he inherited a decisive coup to reach a nade in game 4 after he and Thomas fell 2 points after playing .	-10.4146
His joy at the putt at the 15th hole with which she won the game was that he thought he still believed the victory of the Americans .	-4.9177
" You really need to focus on you and just worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-4.9716
That is all that remains for each player .	-4.1417
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.3207
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were undeniably the only player with more points than Spith and Thomas .	-4.5908
Europe 's strange but amazing pair plays without error and makes everything right .	-4.7277
The only couple who did not get a Bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided them on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-5.7429
This course , and the way in which its energy appears to flow from this fast-paced spectator , makes it the favourite on Sunday and when the sun goes over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who defeated the European victory as Fleetwood or Molinari .	-6.7476
They are probably at the same time at different holes .	-3.5587
Speaking of a European victory now would be too premature .	-2.3688
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious in the morning with his partner Alex Noren .	-3.2421
With a Bogey and two Doubles at the first nine grubs of the Spanish and the Swede set themselves into a hole from which they never came out again .	-5.0148
On Sunday there is no one helping you out of your hole .	-3.1632
Because of the interactions between the matics , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in a straight direction , it is very fascinating to see Fourball and FourX from close quarters .	-7.2073
Europe has been better than team and has taken on a clear lead in the last day , but this Fourteen site has also shown that the American team has the desire to fight what some have doubts about , particularly Stateside .	-7.5988
Europe leads 10-6 on the World Cup Finale Day	-3.4909
Europe will have a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , after it came out of four and four-player games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States .	-5.1450
The Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari inspired the group with two victories on a fighting Tiger Woods to raise their previous balance in the Le Golf National to four points .	-4.6383
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who had lost it in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated the orbiting Fourball team with radiating American team , and won the series with 3-1 .	-6.7843
The US offered more resistance in the fours and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-2.2983
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games of the Sunday to keep the trophy .	-3.5488
Fleetwood is the first European Rookie to win four points in a row , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called Molwood , are only the second pair , which wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-8.6116
After they had destroyed Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourball , it was considered safe that they would strike a sobering Woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechamau through an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-6.4833
Woods , who played two games on Saturday , has occasionally shown brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four players and seven in consequence . and are . are , , and , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.3003
Justin Rose , abandoned for the morning Fourball , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the fourteenth century , proposing in a 2 & 1 defeat by Dusst Johnson and Brooks Koepka – Square and three in the world .	-7.0882
In a pleasant , airy day , however , south-west of Paris , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-3.2824
The three main performers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans on Saturday with two points .	-5.0440
They won a brave 2 : 1-victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourth pack and later returned to play Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the fourth pack after losing the first two holes .	-4.7713
Just twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team will return from a four-point deficit to the singles , although holders of Furyk 's site only need a draw to keep the trophy .	-5.8045
After two days of second season , a Sunday konter looks like though he would go beyond it .	-4.9146
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” unilateral disarmament without confidence .	-3.1900
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions would deepen mistrust of the United States , and that the country would in no case unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons .	-4.1512
Ri Yong Hood , the annual General Assembly of the World body , said that North Korea had taken significant Goodwill measures last year , such as halting nuclear and missile tests , dismantling the nuclear testing kernel , and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-7.2059
" But there is no such answer from the US , " he said .	-2.8483
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no possibility that we should first disarm unilaterally . ”	-3.2562
While Ri retreated the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to dematerialization , which would reward North Korea with gradual steps , his explanation seemed significant in the absence of a unilateral denuclearization , as advocated by Pyongyang in the past .	-7.5674
Ri pointed to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a acting US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore , when Kim committed to working towards " nuclear demilitarisation of the Korean peninsula " , while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-6.1665
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean War 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons .	-4.2602
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of harsh international sanctions against North Korea .	-4.2401
The US insists on " denuclearizing first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , and even reject " Declaration of War " , said Ri .	-4.9822
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to their knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-2.5589
But the problem is that ongoing sanctions intensify our distrust . ”	-2.6241
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President underlined at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.4958
The minister , instead , raised three meetings between Kim and South Korea ’ s leader , Moon Jae , in the last five months , and added : ' If the Party were to be on this issue of demoralizing South Korea rather than the United States , the demilitarisation of the Korean Peninsula would not come into such a deadlock ' .	-7.3657
Nonetheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year , when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evo ’ s President , ” Kim was called the “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.8537
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who last year threatened to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take disarmament steps , but he also said that much work has yet to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed nuclear non-proliferation .	-5.4117
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.3742
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.0861
However , in the United States Secretary of State Mike Pomeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that ' enforcement of the Security Council 's sanctions must be continued vigorously and without deficiency until we implement full , definitive and verified denuclearization ' .	-5.8998
The Security Council unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the funding of Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-3.2635
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he will return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.5560
Pompeo visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.9622
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made , but only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him for “ similar demands . ”	-3.3838
In a meeting with Moon , North Korea promised this month to dismantle a missile base and also a nuclear complex when the United States is taking action .	-5.7792
He said that Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington .	-3.9911
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-2.9414
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of study forced " through nights " .	-4.6639
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often overlooked when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.4637
Charles Clenr , professor of sleep at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , raised the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the United States .	-7.1538
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effect of a lack of sleep on learning .	-3.3222
At the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this the only thing I have said in my final year ?	-5.7938
She said that she never told anyone about the meaning of the sleep – which surprised me " , he said the Telegraph .	-4.0076
The course offered for the first time this year tells students how good sleeping habits encourage academic and sporting performance and improve their overall wellbeing .	-3.9253
Paul Barreira , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after she found that students had fallen extremely little during the week .	-5.1617
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.5134
In a section there is an image of a sleepcloth where students click on coffee , presences , trainers , and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is influenced by a lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeping routine .	-6.5587
In a further section , the participants will explain how long-term sleeping-crime can increase the risk of heart attacks , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-6.4468
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives .	-1.8267
We know that student behaviour will not change immediately .	-1.9714
" But we believe that she has a right - just as you have a right to know the health consequences of the decision to smoke , " Prof. Czeisler added .	-3.7517
The culture of proud to " go through " night " still exists , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students makes sleeping a growing problem .	-5.2499
To have enough sleep of good quality , the " secret weapon " of a student should be to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - not to accept , because sleeping disorders leave the brain in a hunger mode and make it constantly hungry .	-7.3238
Raymond Thus , a 19-year-old California who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he visited one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-5.6177
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to push him toward a campuswide course .	-4.8146
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all Dokotornames to complete a similar study programme before entering the College of Competition .	-5.2689
Prof. Czeir recommended students to give an alert when they go into bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light that is broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can cause their circular dips of the rhythm , causing problems when they sleep .	-8.3401
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal eret Gerrads men .	-2.9099
Continue on track problems of Rangers : After a hit of Dolly Menga , Livingston lost 1-0 defeat for the unsome team of Steven Gerrard .	-6.3038
The Iox team wanted to record its first victory since the 4 : 1-Triumph in February in St. Johnstone .	-6.1319
Menga landed seven minutes before the half-time a hit and an inspiring ranking list did not see it as if it could bring about compensation .	-6.8409
Now that the Rangers fall back to the sixth place , Livinging climb to the rank three and only because of the tordifferential behind Hibernian .	-7.2484
New difficulties for the Rangers are emerging because a head had to be delivered to regular judge Calum Spece after he was hit by a item of writing – apparently thrown away from the industry of the upbeat fans .	-9.3520
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed an Ayr and raised directly to the semi-finals of the Betamax Cup .	-5.1398
On the other hand , bearing in mind the same Livi-Elf , which last week ’ s Hearts made a point , and he would have liked to see how his well-trained team did not give room for action to the opponents at any time . and , and , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.9541
However , the quayers dominated by ballownership , and Livingington had a better chance .	-8.1701
You should have met for only two minutes as Mengas 's first officer Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregor , but the middle field player deceives his big change at the gate .	-8.2099
A deep blow of Keaghan Jacobs then went to captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner , Alan Lithgow , was able to shoot only a long way towards the lower points .	-6.8173
The leaders took control , but there seemed to be more hope than a hold-up in their own game , in the last third .	-5.1503
Alfredo Morelos , after the first quarter of an hour , clearly believed that he had earned an Elf meter after he and Steven Lawless clashed , but Judge Steven Thomson did not make the appeal of the Columbian .	-8.1644
The Rangers only take two shots in the first half , but the former Iox-Torehter Liam Kelly was hardly a lead from Lassana Coulibalys and the results of a bislang Ovie Ejaria .	-9.3022
Even if Livi ’ s openings might have been in the 34th minute ’ s run , no one can deny that they have earned it for their efforts alone .	-5.5778
Yet again , the Rangers failed to face an Jacobean standard situation .	-3.9736
Scott Ardfield reacted not when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball , which kept calm and threw Menga out for a simple finish .	-5.2495
Gerrard was during the break when he exchanged libaly against Ryan Kent , and the change immediately had an impact on the game when the whisper player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly escaped from his line to block .	-6.8524
But Livingston always drew guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett having long slew balls .	-5.8548
Holts team could have further strengthened their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well placed to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner .	-5.8514
The Rangers Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to a penalty because he was covered with Jacobs , but once again he looked away with Thomson .	-6.4091
Almanusch : The inventor of the Geiger Counterer	-5.0092
And now a page from our “ Sunday morning ” : September 30th , 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist John Wilhelm , Hans , Geiger , was born in Germany .	-4.2173
Geiger developed a method of detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that , after all , produced the device known as Geiger .	-5.4408
The Geiger Sticker has since become a Main of Science , as in the 1950 's of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which appears to be the unlikely cowboy scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-6.2038
Man : " What about everything in the world is that ? '	-3.5842
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger who is used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-3.3832
When you put these headphones on , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals . ”	-3.9558
Evans : ‘ Say yes , but now it big ! ’	-3.6605
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63th birthday .	-1.8361
But the invention that bears its name will continue to be used .	-2.1051
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-2.4829
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-1.9701
Vaccines teach the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of the treatment .	-2.3168
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of the cells in the laboratory .	-3.8436
They can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer , and then re-injected .	-3.3392
A study vaccine shows promising results for patients with a number of cancers .	-3.4434
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that releases the immune system to identify rogue cells saw their egg cancer disappearing for more than 18 months .	-4.2025
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , modify them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many types of cancer , and then re-infect the cells .	-5.7543
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : " Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-2.4394
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different types of cancer ” , including breast cancer , eggs , lung and intestinal cancer , Prof. Berzofsky explained .	-3.8162
A similar approach to understanding patients ’ immune cells and teach them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-4.0538

Kanye West was buried in the studio during an Saturday night live broadcast after a run-off speech in which he praised the US , President Donald Trump , and said he will live in 2020 .	-6.7027
After he named his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great hat , he stood up against the Democrats , and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-5.5056
" So often I speak with a white person and she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-3.4476
Now , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America a long time ago , he said .	-5.4265
The Saturn Night-Live-Museum began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon made a statement about board Kavanaughts prior to the Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford 's charges of using Kazvanaugh to sexually force her .	-8.1918
Although it was not aired , the film material was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in the Social Media .	-4.5186
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to throw West with the contribution to it .	-3.9116
West also complained to the audience that he had trouble behind the scene because of his headdress .	-4.2628
" You gave me a parade behind the stage .	-4.6403
You said : ' Do not go with the hat there ' .	-2.8726
You have been angry !	-2.3969
And then they say that I am in an occupied place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-3.0257
West continued : " Want to see the mantle place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman quangle because that means you can 't tell me what I should do , you want the world to move forward ?	-7.3270
Try it with love . ”	-1.4423
His comments were received at least twice by the public with a bonanza and the comedy of Saturday Night appeared to be moved , Variety reported and quoted a person in the words : “ The whole studio was dead . ”	-6.5915
West was used as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-2.8287

“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were impaired as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for the fact that this information was read .	-4.4860
This unconditional claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.7556
Waters explanation quickly led to criticism online , including the former Secretary of the White House , Ari Flester .	-4.6266
“ That the thing is getting worse is very annoying , ” he wrote meat .	-5.1625
“ This suggests that it is inappropriate as a member of Congress .	-4.2236
When someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-3.2628
They must not be rampant .	-2.9428
They must not challenge the plaintiff ’ s motives .	-2.5195
They have to be calm and quiet . ”	-2.5485
Farer seemed to compare Waters ’ response with the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , who was accused of critics being angry during the hearing on Thursday .	-5.8123
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ran next to the baseless water during the midterm elections , expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.5610
“ Big , if true , ” he loved .	-1.7728
In her statement , Waters said that her office ' informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities about the fraudulent claims .	-3.8820
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are captured and brought to account for their actions , which are destructive and dangerous to my employees , ” they continued .	-4.0741
Review by " Johnny English – One lives only three times " – badly occupied Parodie with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.3076
It is tradition to search for explanations in every new film , with British trend , and this seems to be the revival of the Johnny English Acedy-Spoudo-Jury applicable to the franchise .	-8.9558
Is the ironic self-mercy of the humanity under the abyss the nation 's new export option ?	-4.4961
In any case , the author of the script has received the license for the second time to reshuffle matters .	-9.2150
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims on Smoote-Glamour , has got a little clouseau , a syringer Mr. Bean and a sock from this guy , who has contributed a single note to the guiding melody of the firefighters at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-7.2172
He is also based on travellers and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the long-forgotten Barclaque-TV TV , always grabbed chaos .	-4.8310
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny Englisch street .	-2.9222
I loved Johnny English , who comes closer to a helicopter in a medieval armor , and the main rotor , right against his helmet .	-5.7831
Atkinson 's talent for body combinations is to be seen , but the humor feels quite weak and strange , especially as the " serious " film headers like 007 and mission Impossible confidently offer comedy as an ingredient .	-5.3120
The humor feels as though he is more directed to children than to adults , and for me the crazy misadventures of Johnny English are not so inventive and focuses like Atkinson ’ s Mr. uses .	-6.5392
The every premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-3.5312
A cyber hacker infused the highly secret British network of spies and reveals the identity of all British agents on the spot , to feed the service agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-5.0059
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a poignant and insurgent personality and already suffers a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .	-6.1600
Your secret service consultants inform you that as each individual has compromised , each person has to bring someone out of retirement .	-6.6316
And this means that the great pathpathogen Johnny English itself , who is now employed as a school master in a noble body , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock-Academy through espionage .	-7.9912
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency belt and reconstituted with his former long-suffering Cumpel Bough , who is played again by Ben Miller .	-5.0135
Boungh is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overtired , Burschious role in which Vicki Pecelline does not have full effect .	-7.4011
So , the Batman and Robin of the chaos of their Majesty 's Secret Service are back in action and meet beautiful Counties in Olga Kurylenikos .	-4.3133
In the meantime , the Prime Minister has become a dangerous feature of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the sinister Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-5.6929
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the colorful high jinks : As a waiter , they create a French Flash Restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board of Voltas luxury yeight ; and English pure anarchy occurs when he tries to become familiar with a Virtual Reality Headset with the inside of Voltas house .	-6.8067
For these last sequence , all registers have certainly been drawn , but so amiable and forgetting it , it reminds us of child television .	-8.2014
That is reasonable .	-2.1793
And , as with the other Johny Englisch ilms , I could not fail to think : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not have a role that really does meet his talent ?	-6.6272
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-3.0979
Jeremy Corbyns Labour is reviewing a radical plan in which Britain works only four days a week , but is paid for five .	-3.8041
According to reports , the Party wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution to workers by giving them an extra day .	-3.2488
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.7014
Sources said that the idea would fit with the Party 's economic agenda and plans to kidnap the country for workers .	-4.2987
The Congress on Trade has approved the changeover to a four-day week period as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-5.7575
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-4.3969
A four-day week target is one that matches the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of workers and the party ’ s overall industrial strategy , but this goal will not be realised overnight .	-5.3220
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign in 2017 .	-2.6285
However , the entire Labour Party is currently not supporting this initiative .	-4.0210
A speaker from the Labour Party said : ' A four-day week is not party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-3.0163
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.5234
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit makers ' in utilities .	-4.1142
The shadow-Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not recover their entire share , as a Labour government may “ pick up ” could do so because of alleged misconduct .	-7.4854
It also confirmed the plans to appoint and inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private sector capital to employees receiving the annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.5989
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether the FBI investigation against Kavanaugh could change their opinion .	-3.1636
The Supreme Court ’ s final vote on the appeal of the Supreme Court was postponed for at least a week , owing to an ongoing FBI investigation on allegations against Justice O. Kavanaugh , and raises the question of whether the FBI ’ s findings might lead to abandoning its support for Kavanaugh .	-8.2856
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 Minutes , ” Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI ’ s findings could spur them to change their opinion .	-5.8066
Kennedy appeared as his fellow Member from South Carolina .	-3.0884
Kennedy said .	-1.2648
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-2.4257
I called him after it happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.4841
He was determined , targeted , unequivocal . '	-2.1919
However , Graham 's voice seemed to be in stone .	-3.6739
" I took a view of board Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb catch , " he said .	-4.8016
" Dr. Ford , I don 't know what happened , but I know that board won the charge hard , " Graham added a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.7568
" No one they called could confirm it .	-2.9458
It is 36 years old .	-1.5728
I see nothing new about this . '	-2.4683
" What is the Global Cities Festival and has ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-2.7593
This Saturday , the Global Cities Festival will take place in New York , an annual musical event with an impressive selection of stars and an impressive mission to end world poverty .	-4.5319
This year ’ s seventh Global Cities Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together in the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience stars like Janet Jackson , Cardinal B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the real objective of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.7938
The Global Cities Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of Global Poverty Projects , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting it .	-4.1922
To get a free ticket for the event , the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or actions , such as volunteering , an email to a world leader , a telephone call or other useful ways of increasing the objective of combating poverty and increasing awareness of it .	-5.9728
But how successful has Global Cities been to achieve its goal with 12 remaining years ?	-4.4890
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way to convince people , to call for action , or simply another case of the so-called ' clicktivismus ' - people who feel to be so different by signing an online petition or an online application or by making a tweet , as if they make a real difference ?	-7.1734
Global cities say that since 2011 , more than 19 million “ actions ” have been recorded by its supporters , pushing for a variety of targets .	-5.0585
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of over $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.5896
At the beginning of 2018 , the Group took 390 actions and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion was already paid or financed .	-5.1887
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.1525
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutring , a partnership of investors and executive organizations , based in Britain , committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization has the promise to help Rwanda , with $ 35 million , to end in in the country , after reaching global citizens more than 4.700 Tw.	-8.2295
“ With support from the British government , donor , other state governments , and global citizens like you , we can bring about the social injustice of malnutrition one day ’ s history , ” said The Power of Numotive ambassador Tracey Ullman the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-6.1542
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the UK , which aimed to improve maternal and child nutrition , the government will achieve the funding of the project " Power of Nubery " 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-5.5839
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.5546
Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-3.8910
Like the great civil law and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed because we are more powerful .	-3.4933
The stars Janet Jackson , Weknard , Shawn Mendes , Cardinal B and Janelle Monáe will be present at this year ’ s event in New York , hosted by Deauville Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-6.1032
US Navy forces a “ blockade ” to hinder Russian energy exports – Interior Secretary .	-4.0679
Washington can , if necessary , use its navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Home Secretary Ryan is quoted by Washington Examiner .	-4.2787
Zinke argued that Russia ’ s involvement in Syria – particularly in the invitation of the lawful government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-4.1408
“ I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is this : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.5786
And , according to the officials , there are ways to deal with it .	-3.1053
" The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that the sea routes are open , and if necessary to block , to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.7520
Zinke spoke to participants of an event of Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that itself describes as a “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.0990
He forgot Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are actually the same .	-3.8869
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said while calling Russia a " pon-pon-pony " economy that is dependent on fossil fuels .	-4.4778
The opinions come as the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquid gas to Europe , and to replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-4.5374
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to stop Germany from “ unmessing ” the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would turn Berlin into “ captured ” .	-6.2201
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion North Stream 2 pipeline , intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters , is a purely economic project .	-4.3511
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply economic , and an example of unfair competition .	-2.1509
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers , ” said Russian energy minister Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.7180
The US position has caused a backlash from Germany , which has confirmed its commitment to the project .	-2.8000
Germany ’ s leading industrial organisation , the Federal Association of German industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to stand out from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-4.0997
" I have a big problem when a third state enters our energy supply , " said the German Industry Federation ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-3.6115

" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-2.0394
In criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court , Warren did not take a hand over board Kavanaugh .	-4.5845
Warren said in a Tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-3.2396
But a poll published on Thursday revealed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters did not believe that it should run 2020 .	-3.2905

Palin referred to his arrest as “ the elephant in the room , ” and said about her son and other veterans : “ You are coming back a little bit differently , coming back harder and asking whether the work of their co-soldiers and the air force and all the other members of the military is respected for the country . ”	-6.5856

18 states and Washington , D.C. provide legal support for a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-3.2069

The US ’ s new asylum policy has reversed a decision by the 2014 complaints chamber that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum .	-4.5769
In an opinion on Friday , the Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Racine said that the new law ignored decades of the state , federal , and international law .	-4.7235
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all asylum applications must be assessed according to the circumstances of the relevant complaint and that such action is contrary to this principle .	-6.6402
lawyers continued to argue in the sentence that policies refusing entry to immigrants harm the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and do “ necessary work . ”	-5.5186
General Jeff Sesters has ordered immigration judges in June not to grant asylum to people fleeing home or gang life .	-5.6665
“ Asylum belongs to those who have to leave their country because of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion , ” said sessions in his statement on the law on 11 June .	-4.6069
Asylum has never been intended to alleviate all problems , even those serious people face every day around the world .	-4.8335

US Ambassador raises China ’ s “ bullying ” with “ propaganda ”	-3.5337
One week after an official Chinese newspaper published a four-page display in a US newspaper on the mutual benefits of the Chinese trade , the US ambassador in Beijing suggested using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.9274
U.S. President Donald Trump , on Wednesday , referred to China 's Daily Service in the The Moines tab - the state with the most sold newspaper in Iowa - following charges that he had accused China of interfering in the US Congress elections of 6 November , which China is denying .	-8.1479
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of meddling in the US elections is a new phase in a escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-3.6288
While it is normal for foreign states to turn ads to encourage trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.5412
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliation tariffs on Chinese and US experts should meet exporters in US states such as Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.8818
Terry Branstad , the American ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa , a significant exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing has hurt American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-4.4540
China , Branstad wrote in an article in the Moines Register on Sunday , “ is now firmly engaged in this bullying using propaganda in our own free press .	-4.1352
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid display in the hinder register , China ’ s government is exploiting the estimated American tradition of freedom of opinion and the press , ” Branstad wrote .	-4.6980
" By contrast , you will find limited dissenters at the Moscow newspaper stand on the streets of Beijing , not a true dissenting of differences of opinion that could have made the Chinese people worried about China ’ s economic development , given that the media are firmly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-7.7859
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers resisted the offering to publish , " although he did not say what newspaper he said .	-4.6652
The Republicans overran the Kavanaugh debacle against the Midterm-election , analysts warn .	-5.7155
Many of the top Republicans defended the Kavanaugh board , a nominal ee elected by the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assault , warning analysts that they will see a backlash in the upcoming elections , especially women .	-6.2250
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already stated that they want to vote for it .	-2.8690
These things cannot be attributed , said Grant Reeher , professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-3.2191
Reeher said , he doubts that last minute 's assistance from Jeff Flake ( United Kingdom ’ s Republican Representative for the Arizona State ) was enough to help FBI investigation .	-6.7034
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , Senior-pastor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-4.6486
On Friday morning , the protesters sang : “ The November is coming ! ” while they were demonstrating in the Senate ’ s hall when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to nominate Kavanghas in spite of the statement by Dr continuing Christine Blasey Ford , Mic reported .	-7.3311
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalists .	-2.0760
" People say that it is already quite far advanced , that is true .	-4.7655
But the number could be higher , especially in the pre-cities and younger , 18-29 , who may not suffer the president but often do not vote . ”	-4.7973
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she made her accusations of sexual violence against the candidate for the Supreme Court , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans drive the candidacy .	-5.5703
“ For the GOOP this has become a shattering mess , ” said Michael Steele , former president of the Republican National Committee , beginning last week , according to NBC News .	-4.6226
“ It is not just about the committee elections or the final elections , or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the substitutes bank , it is about how the Republicans have handled it and how they have been treated , ” says Guy Cecil , director of the US priorities , a group that helps in the election of the Democrats to the news station .	-8.0632
But Americans are divided by what Ford and Kavanaugh have said .	-2.4753
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of survey Fords ’ testimonies were definitive or likely to believe , while 35 % claim that they were definitely or probably believed in Kazvanaugh .	-6.4245
Moreover , 38 % said they thought that Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said the same thing about Ford .	-3.4077
On the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently examining the allegations of Ford and at least one other Ankachah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-4.9980
Ford said last week to the Senate Justice Committee that Kavanaugh attacked them at the age of 17 .	-3.0314
Ramirez accuses the supreme prosecutor of nominating , while in the 1980s , her academic life in Yale was exposed to his genitals in front of her .	-8.2430

Later , he stretched up to the firing line , leading the line forward with the “ biggest Galat ” before he pulled a field gun and pushed three times the withdrawal .	-7.4884
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German explorer on October 4 , 1918 – just a month from the end of the war .	-3.8060
Michael Vann , 72 , said the actions of his grandfather were " something that I know could never do justice to , something that throws a humility . "	-4.4594
He and his brother James Vann also settled a wreath after the parade run by the Brentwood Youth Imperial Band .	-3.5462
Michael Vann said he felt “ very honoured to participate in the parade ” and added : “ The dance of a real hero is reflected in the support he receives from many people . ”	-4.0089
MMA fans stayed throughout the night to see Bellator 206 , instead they got Peppa Pig .	-3.4947
Imagine you have stayed awake all night to view the complete Bellator 206-event just to see the main event .	-5.4037
There were 13 battles on the plan in San Jose , including six main battles and was shown live on Channel 5 in the night in the UK .	-5.1471
At 6 a.m. , just as Gegard Moussasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet , viewers in the UK were able to see how the media were switched to Pespa Pig .	-7.5597
Some were unbroken after they had been awake until the early hours of the morning , extra for the fight .	-6.1495
A fan on Twitter described the change to child carton as " some bad joke " .	-3.9392
" It is a state rule that at 6 a.m. this content was not suitable , so that it had to change to children 's programs , " said Dave Bretz , Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication , when asked for the transfer .	-5.9497
" Peppa the join , " yes " .	-3.4386
In the future , Bellier CEO Scott Coker said that they will work on their plans to involve British viewers .	-5.8573
“ If I think of the repetition , we will somehow get it out , ” said Cocker .	-3.9228
" But it is 6 a.m. in a Sunday there and we will only be able to fix it on Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-4.7215
But we are working on it .	-1.5421
Believe me when it was turned , a lot was written and the content were all not friendly .	-3.2512
We tried to repair it , we thought it would be a technical error .	-1.1802
But it was not , it was a government problem .	-1.7928
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-1.8253
We will reduce it to five rather than six battles - as we usually do - and we have tried to surpass those fans and have simply gone over .	-4.6733
It is a bad situation . '	-1.5810
Desert Island Discos : Tom Daley felt less about his sexuality .	-3.3021
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he has grown up with the feeling to be everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-4.5854
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware of the continuing school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-4.3362
In the first edition of Desert Island discs at Radio 4 , Lauren Laverne said that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals in order to give other " hope " .	-3.5651
He also said that a victory at the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important for him .	-2.4335
The usual author of the show , Kristy Young , has released several months due to an illness .	-5.2380
Daley appeared in Lavernes ’ first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand up to men and women . ”	-4.6860
He said : “ To this day , these sentiments of the little value one and the balance of the other gave me the power and strength , I needed you to be successful . ”	-6.2643
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said he would not disappoint anyone if he were guided by his sexual orientation .	-3.7414
The double-painted bronze medal winner has become a high quality LGBT activists and used his appearance at this year 's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to criminalise homosexuality .	-4.4735
He said he wanted to speak out because he was fortunate enough to live open and without consequences , and because he wanted to give other ' hope ' .	-5.0138
The three-fold world champion said that he was in a man he fell in love with US film maker Bruce Black , whom he met in 2013 , what he was very surprised about .	-6.1474
Daley married the Oscar winner , who is 20 years older than he last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-5.1878
“ If one performs so much in so young years ” – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time , three years later his father died in cancer – be it difficult , according to him , to find someone at the same age who has experienced similar high and low levels .	-6.4438
The couple was parents of a son , Robert Ray Black-Daley , and Daley said his " whole perspective " has changed .	-3.4877
“ Last year , everything for me was about winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-2.6064
" But you know what is more important than gold .	-2.3013
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-1.2619
His son is Robert , the name of his father , who died in 2011 after cancer diagnosis with only 40 years .	-4.1204
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.4681
“ I could not say to him : ‘ You will not experience sitting in the first row , ‘ Dad ’ ’ , he said .	-4.2267
“ I kept his hand when his breathing was rallying ; only when he was really no longer breathable and dead , I realized that he wasn ’ t invincible , ” he said .	-6.3632
Next year , Daley joined and won bronze at the Olympic Games in 2012 .	-2.4466

The Phantom Mickelson was sitting on the bank at the Ryder Cup Saturday .	-4.8084
American Phil Mickelson will perform a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup games , but he must dramatically improve his form so that no sadder milestone becomes .	-5.4637
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was taken by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourball and FourX on Saturday .	-6.2039
Instead of being at the center of the event , as is often the case for the United States , the five-time majority winner informed his day between fire and bad rounds on the golf course , hoping to overcome his depth .	-7.8827
Even at the peak of his career , the 48-year-old driver is not the perfect place for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly penalizes errors .	-6.8981
And as if the place were not just challenging enough , Mickelson will hit the ninth match on Sunday at the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with newcomer Tommy Fleetwood .	-6.7768
If the Americans are lagging behind and having a hot start at the start of the 12 individual games , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely vital .	-6.9866
Furyk expressed his trust in his man ; something else left him .	-4.9768
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on my back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-4.5090
“ He has much confidence .	-1.6793
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-2.8551
Probably I would not have thought he was playing two games .	-2.4873
I wanted to see more , but this is the way in which we had to deal with it .	-6.4294
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.6033
So far Nick Faldo has the record of most of the poker matches at the Ryder Cup , Mickelson will break on Sunday .	-3.9127
This could mark the end of a cup career that never kept up to the heights of its individual record .	-5.1288
Mickelson had a population of 18 , 20 times lost and seven times lost lost .	-9.3100
" He is a witty , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to speak people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.8082
I think younger players had also fun this week to measure with him , that was pretty good . ”	-4.9623
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.6114
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major lead can soon disappear .	-3.1052
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a major advance in individual games last day can quickly become an inconvenient riot at the Ryder Cup .	-4.5093
In 1997 , the Danish debuted in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seal Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only barely passed over the target line and won with a ultra-thin lead of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-5.7129
" You remember that you were in Valderrama ; we had a big lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only just a short , " said Bjorn , after heading for the class of 2018 , now with 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-7.3543
History will tell me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-3.8478
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-0.9502
Get out and do the right things .	-2.4227
It is only over when the items are displayed on the panel .	-3.5165
Our goal is to win this Cup , and we concentrate on that .	-3.1617
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-3.9975
Björn added the excitement his players played on a hard golf course : " I would never be too fast .	-5.1087
Tomorrow is also another day .	-1.2765
Tomorrow , personal performances are coming , and that is another matter .	-4.7558
It ’ s great there to be with a partner when things go well , but if you ’ re out there , your own skills as a golf player will be tested on the whole .	-6.0922
This is the message you have to send to the players : get the best out of them tomorrow .	-2.9955
Now you get over to your partner and you have to make full use of it . ”	-4.2746
Unlike Björn , Jim Furyk will strive for his players to perform more than they do as partners separately , with the exception of Jordan and Justin Thomas , who took three out of four points .	-9.0877
Furyk himself has already experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , when he was part of the podium team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers , after the European team has made the “ miracle of Medirelatives ” .	-6.5897
" I remember every word of condemnation , " he said about how Ben Crenshaw , the 1999 captain , had assembled his players on the way to the last day .	-4.9599
We have 12 major games tomorrow , but you want to get started as soon as possible , as you saw in Brookline , in Mediclose .	-5.0967
In fact , if a dynamic of its own is developed , the pressure is exerted on the middle matches .	-6.9090
We have built our chart accordingly , and got the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to make something special tomorrow . ”	-7.5500
Thomas , together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood , and Ian Poulter , should lead the other European woman on the top places in the ranking , the counter against Rory McIlroy .	-5.8610
I placed this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole road , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-4.5564
Once again postponing the timetable for Germany ’ s new ship of	-10.1054
The German Marine ’ s latest Fregate should have been served in 2014 to replace Cold War vessels that were cooked for years , but now , according to the flawed systems and escalating costs , local media reports will take at least up to next year .	-9.2074
The start-up of the “ Rheinland-Pfalz ” , the governing vessel of the brand new anti-Stuttgart class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ The Time ” , on the basis of a military .	-7.4341
The Marine should have taken ships in 2014 , but serious problems following the first delivery were burdened by the ambitious project .	-4.7597
The four ships of the Bremen-Class fleet were replaced by the Bavarian Marine team that were ordered in 2007 .	-7.2901
It has been assumed that they have a powerful cannons , a number of flight sensors and ship sensors , as well as some traditional technologies such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-6.3367
Other important advantages are longer maintenance intervals : the latest Frescates are to be used for up to two years without running the home port .	-5.9099
But the state-of-the-art warships to allow Germany to develop power overseas will already become obsolete by the constant delays when they are finally put on service , as the weekly newspaper “ Time ” notes .	-6.4748
Last year , the unhappy F125-Fregate made headlines when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship in operation , and returned it to the shipyard of Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-5.3762
This was the first time that the Marine returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery .	-3.8019
The reasons for the return of ships were little known ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware programs , ” which would make the war ship useless for purposes of fighting .	-5.6452
Software defects were particularly important as the ships of Baden-Württemberg 's annual class are operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half the crew on older ferries in the Bremen-class .	-6.4787
It was also evident that the ship had a heavy weight , which would limit performance and make future upgrades more difficult for the Navy .	-6.6603
It is assumed that the 7.000 Tonnes- “ Rheinland-Pfalz ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II .	-3.6231
In addition to error hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including the training of the crew - will be discussed .	-4.4721
Instead of the initial EUR 2.2 billion , the costs have now apparently reached the staggering level of EUR 3.1 billion ( about $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.6552
The problems with the latest poppies are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s seafaring sector is sinking .	-6.8682
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , chairman of the German Parliament ’ s defense committee , said that the fleet actually had ‘ ships capable of being deployed ’ .	-4.4816
The official said that the problem had grown over time as old ships were left out of service without any replacement .	-5.0222
He complained that no of the Baden-Württemberg trade fair called the Marine Corps .	-5.2544
The National Trust authority the secret life of Fledermärn .	-4.3032
New research on a property in the Highlands of Scotland will find out how bats use the countryside to search for food .	-4.6345
It is hoped that this will give new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals , which can provide guidance for future measures to protect animals .	-6.1340
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by meandering and Sopran-Pbas as well as brownish langoher and Dauventon Flechers in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-8.7164
Special reception equipment is placed at main points of the accommodation to follow Fledermaktion during the whole season .	-5.7803
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors .	-2.2509
A professional recording analysis of all pictures determines the frequency of the bat bars and classifies the Ruff of species .	-6.1775
The habitats map to be created and the corresponding report should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-4.6470
Rob Dewar , National Trust Adviser for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of life are most important for the bats and how they are used by the different species .	-4.2336
This information will help to identify the benefits of the management of life , how best to obtain the forest for bats and other species related to them .	-6.1158
In Scotland and the whole of the UK , the Fledermapulfe had a sharp decline in the last hundred years .	-7.3392
They are threatened by works that affect their sleeping places and the loss of a habitat .	-3.4184
Wind turbines and lighting can also present a risk , as well as some of the chemical treatments of building materials .	-5.3831

You are using a sophisticated Echelon repository technology to localize errors and obstacles in your flight path .	-6.9854
The NTS , responsible for managing more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-3.3927
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys , deposit places , and sometimes save lives .	-4.5286
The organization has even established Scotland 's first and only dedicated Fledermaurevat in the Threade estate in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish Fledermahogatypes are based .	-6.1587
According to Administrator David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.6560
“ Here in Triave we have a fantastic area for bats . ”	-3.2759
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good habitat .	-2.1557
But there is still a lot of unknown about bats and the work we do here and elsewhere helps us better understand what they need to live . ”	-3.9798
He stresses that it is important to check before maintenance work in buildings if the bats are there ; according to him , it is possible that when a single child 's playground is destroyed , a whole local population may be wiped out .	-8.8643
Fleterbad are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-5.0093
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish staff at the Bat Conservation Trust , encouraged the public to help .	-2.5894
She said : “ We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-3.1263
Ronaldo has rapist rights when lawyers lawyers have questioned the German magazine .	-5.6172
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-3.4900
His lawyers become familiar with the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-4.1091
The storm from Portugal and Juventus was accused of having raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-3.7849
He was asked to pay her $ 375,000 to remain silent about the incident , reported Der Spiegel on Friday .	-3.4428
For hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an instant live video , returned the reports as “ fake news . ”	-5.6383
No , no , no , no , no .	-0.9097
What they say today , Fake News , ” said the five-time balloon winner in the camera .	-2.8721
" You want to apply yourself by using my name .	-1.9400
“ That is normal .	-1.5092
They want to draw attention when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.9472
I ’ m a happy man , and everything is good , ” the player added smiling .	-3.4499
For the claims , Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are preparing a complaint against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ an illegal reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy . ”	-6.2168
Christian jurist Schetz said that the player will claim damages for “ immaterial damage to the severity of the violation , which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . ”	-6.7600
The alleged incident was to have occurred in June 2009 in a suite of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-4.5779
According to the documents submitted by Clark County in the state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga went back to the player ’ s room in a night club where he raped it .	-5.4027
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was brought to his knees after the alleged event , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” left behind by the “ one per cent . ”	-5.7825
These documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-2.8565
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and made photographs of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extra-judicial agreement , because she had " fears of retaliation " and was concerned about " being publicly humiliated " .	-5.9700
The 34-year-olds say that they are now trying to render the agreement invalid because it is still traumatized by the alleged incident .	-4.9613
Ronaldo was on his move to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of his alleged attack and moved this summer with a € 100 million deal to the Italian giants juve .	-6.0325
Brexit : Britain would always regret losing car producers .	-2.4406
“ The United Kingdom would regret it in times when Brexit would lose its position as world leading automobile manufacturers , ” said Minister Greg Clark .	-5.3234
He added that it was " worrying " that Toyota UK announced to the BBC that it would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston , near Derby , if major Europeans left the EU without a deal .	-5.6208
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-2.5186
Japanese car manufacturers said that the impact of delays on borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.5907
The factory in Burnaston , which manufactures the brands Auris and Aventis for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-4.1073
" If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think it is our production stop , " said Marvin Cook , CEO of Toyota Burnanton .	-5.2395
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.7459
BMW , for example , has already announced that it will close its work in Oxford after Brexit a month .	-6.3773
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.0481
The production facilities of Toyota are based on heavy-duty manufacturing , i.e. the parts are delivered every 37 minutes from UK suppliers and the EU for special products .	-5.0418
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there can be delays on the border , which , according to industry evidence , may lead to shortages and subshortages .	-4.8178
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of the stock in its factory in Derbyshire , the company said , and that would stop production .	-3.9643
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU is “ very calibrated to avoid these border controls . ”	-3.9088
We have to have a deal : we want the best deal , which not only enables us to make the current success , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said the BBC Radio 4 programme Today .	-6.4436
“ The reference not only from Toyota , but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.1208
Toyota did not specify how long the production stops could take , but warned that in the long run , the cost increase would suffer the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lost jobs .	-7.7339
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives , and since 24 years in Burnaston , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ I have experience of job losses once they have been cut . ”	-5.8278
A government spokesperson said : ' We have put forward a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU . '	-7.5905
Trump ’ s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again , says the White House .	-3.6705
Donald Trump ’ s high-profile meeting with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could " be postponed another week , " because the battle for the Supreme Court candidate will go on board Kavanaugh , leaving the White House on Sunday .	-4.9036
Rosenstein supervised the work of the Special Advisor , Robert Mueller , who explores Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstruction of justice by the president .	-4.8861
Whether Trump will or will not fire the Deputy Attorney General , and thus threaten the independence of Müller , Washington has brought many lessons for months .	-5.0165
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed taking a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible for the president to remove the 25th constitutional amendment .	-4.5327
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.1638
But last Monday he came to the White House , while reports objected that he was about to resign .	-3.3330
Instead , a meeting with Trump at the time at the United Nations in New York was announced for Thursday .	-6.1144
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee , in the Kavanaugh and one of women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual behaviour .	-5.2745
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh and delayed a full Senate bill .	-4.1577
Donald Trump ’ s press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-1.6943
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A date has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I went back another week , given all the other things that the Supreme Court is going on .	-6.6641
But we will see and I keep the press informed . '	-2.5811
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-1.8418
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.6415
Sanders said that the lack of post is not an insult to television supporters who behave as self-actors , but she also said : ' I will not be against being in the gallery ' .	-5.7799
It then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.9179
" The President raises more questions and answers than any President said before him , " she said and added , without giving evidence : " We have seen these figures . "	-5.9295
Stamping will still take place , said Sanders , but if the press has the opportunity to ask the President of the United States the questions directly , that is infinitely better than speaking with her .	-5.2872
We are trying to do much of that and you have seen how we have done that in recent weeks , and it will replace a press debate if you can speak to the President of the United States themselves . ”	-4.1839
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attending public meetings or press conferences with interested dignitaries .	-3.1759
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.1961
In New York , President this week perhaps showed why by making a freestanding and sometimes bizarre appearance with assembled reporters .	-5.0258
Brexit Fear : Secretary of State of State of EU Workers in the NHS Scotland	-7.1233
Health Minister has written EU staff in Scotland ’ s NHS to stay at the country ’ s gratitude and desire for Brexit .	-4.7427
The Scottish parliament MEP Jane Freeman wrote her letter less than 6 months before Britain left the EU .	-3.7613
The Scottish Government has agreed to accept the cost of the agreed status requests for EU citizens working in its decentralized public service .	-3.4012
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : “ In the course of the summer , negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit were continued , along with expected decisions in the autumn .	-4.5061
But the British government , too , has been preparing for a possible no-fly scenario .	-4.6116
I know that this must be a very worrying time for you all .	-2.0192
That is why I wanted to reiterate how much I would value the contribution of every employee , regardless of nationality .	-4.5367
Members from across the EU and beyond will bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve our health system and benefit the patients and communities that we provide .	-5.5219
Scotland is certainly your home and we want it to remain . ”	-2.5965
Christian Abercrombie is engaged in an emergency operation after a head injury .	-3.7317
The Tennessee State Tigger Defender Christian Abercrombie was subjected to an emergency operation after a head injury in 31 to 27 defeat on Saturday .	-5.1798
Tennessee States Head Coach Rod Reed told reporters that injury was about to occur shortly before the mid-term .	-5.1313
“ He came to the page line and had simply collapsed somehow , ” said Reed .	-4.1138

However , the ad published on the company 's Facebook page has caused controversy online .	-3.0729
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers , many of whom say it looks at the " terror " of the dairy industry .	-3.6852

Another commented : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who wear off ( often on their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-4.5757
This is not an advertising that praises or judges the dairy industry . '	-3.4759
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they have all captured in their BHs with moderate pumps .	-4.7894

Hundreds of migrants ' children quietly moved into a tent camp on the Texas border .	-3.1196

Traditionally , most sponsors themselves have been undocumented immigrants , and fear that they will risk being expelled when they are committed to a child .	-6.1172

The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they are scared or depressed , which may lead to violent outbreaks or flight outbreaks .	-4.7548
Advocates have said that these concerns are reinforced in a larger body such as Tornillo , where evidence that a child has to fight is rather overlooked because of its size .	-5.4663

France has deployed more than 1,000 soil soldiers in the war-ravaged country .	-1.8008
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for returning are correct , and he accused “ provoking some Western countries of irrational fear , ” which led refugees to keep away .	-5.3212
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” that is mouse .	-3.5949
“ You are politicizing a purely humanitarian question . ”	-2.2448
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction assistance to Syria when a political agreement between Assad and the opposition ended the war .	-3.8292
UN diplomats have said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib provides the opportunity to advance political talks .	-3.8687
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russia against Syrian troops on the province in which three million people live .	-3.5054
