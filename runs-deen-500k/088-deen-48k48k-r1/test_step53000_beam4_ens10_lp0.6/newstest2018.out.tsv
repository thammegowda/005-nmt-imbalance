An irreconcilable place where young people are to meet today .	-4.0684
A pit chapel where you can now dig up for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-4.8502
The former peasant farmers managed the temporary cause .	-4.7279
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories about days .	-3.7342
It is annoying if maps are not up to date .	-3.6673
Everyone who had to get excited about this , because the car Navi was racing a green meadow instead of a change road .	-7.6488
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases , an offer of the state government in Bavaria , are far from current - but they are very illuminating .	-5.9984
Especially when compared to current online maps .	-1.5670
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the area of Munich ’ s spreading area .	-5.3897
The Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you won 't even notice as such .	-4.6630
In the large outlines , more detailed maps were compiled for cities and communities , known as .	-5.6429
This was the result of information from the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 and in .	-7.5699
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.6429
The French army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria .	-2.4654
Napoleon sought an overview of the occupied land and ordered a topographical record of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-3.9708
Even though the French troops finally broke out with the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , today 's neighbours were creating the idea of a comprehensive Bayon card .	-5.9520
fondst Max IV Joseph pushed the project forward , founded the Topographic Bureau and thus the Bavarian surveying administration .	-7.6165
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library .	-4.3579
The comparison in the past / today is most impressive , for example , by the capital city .	-9.9393
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.8598
One example of this is subletting , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.9967
It was 21 years after the creation of the card , that is to say 1877 , when the Munich district was established .	-6.2531
Today , understeering is in the centre of the city .	-4.4823
The houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plingansraße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878 , a leader of the rise of the Bavarian farmers against Austria 1705 .	-5.7906
Where the West Park is today , there is nothing to look like fields - at first glance : a smaller card appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand-numbered flubs from the so-called " Urmount " , which derived the base tax .	-10.7833
Small parcelles no longer have farmers - they are small-scale members of the " land in the sun " facility .	-6.6930
A large green area is situated north of Subing .	-4.4126
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the Oktoberfest site , was actually still a meadow and no concrete craters in the 19th century .	-4.8847
On the other side of the Isar , the historic map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.4471
In the Urpositsblatt you can read in the territory of today ’ s Au-Haidhausen district not only the street name " at the Gastein gorge " or from the hill " on the pond " - but also in large letters " Irn Anstalt " .	-8.6547
Yes , here at the Auerfeldstrasse people once descended upon delusions .	-5.4372
There , in 1858 / 59 , the Munich Kreis - Unsannstalt was born .	-7.2951
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden was head of the body - the psychiatrist who was brought to death by King Ludwigs II .	-7.2665
" He was advanced for his time and ended , for example , the snakes of the so-called unreal .	-5.6426
In addition , he has refused to use violence against the occupants , " says Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Haidihausen , who has engaged in an exhibition with the Anstalt .	-6.1393
For 280 patients , there was first place , later extended to 500 places .	-5.9040
At some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for constructing the circle shelter in hair 1905 .	-6.0088
Since 2006 , Isar Ampeer-Klinike München-Ost is one of Germany 's largest psychiatrists .	-3.6826
On the premises of former Auer Anstalt , young people are now meeting at the Munich Salesian .	-4.5850
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training establishments .	-4.2333
The TSV München Ost football pitch is west of the city , east of the 1980s residential homes .	-6.2344
In 2015 , Casa Don Bosco built the children ’ s house , in architectural terms , on the origin of the unreal atmosphere , which had been destroyed by bombing attacks during World War II .	-7.7536
The Marienplatz square was a " main square " in 1856 , when the Kaufingerstraße was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-5.3616
The Second World War also brought a significant change in the heart of Munich .	-3.5032
The Allied bombs of December 1944 set out many holes in the city centre .	-3.3586
A big stay until today - at the Marienhof .	-4.0047
The English Institute , small shops and a medieval Greifenka band were once on display at the Marienhof , where the halls and concert hall were held on 5th April 2017 for the second .	-9.7245
With the flap you can compare the old München-card with the air picture of today - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.8666
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri .	-2.0910
National Association for the Promotion of Colored has issued a warning for coloured people who travel to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.5429
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for African-American travellers , visitors and visitors to raise particular attention and extreme caution when traveling through the state of Missouri , as a number of suspected , racist incidents have occurred in recent times throughout the state and are recorded in the opinion of the group .	-7.5082
A recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes people more difficult to win lawsuits , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , which disproportionately target minorities , led the group to issue travel warning , said NAACP .	-5.6482
" You have violations of the civil rights that happen to people .	-2.6812
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the president of Missouri , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-4.1383
" We are hearing complaints in such an frequency that we have not yet heard . "	-2.7394
It is the first such warning that the organization for a US state issued .	-3.7422
The group cited incidents such as racist misbehavior against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.9996
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more fuel during his trip through the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri without being accused of crime .	-5.8131
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the State are more likely to be arrested than white .	-5.9179
" The recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and employees are informed of what may happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-3.5831
" People have to be willing to bring in expenses or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-5.3450
In 2015 , Missouri reported 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s Hassan criminal program , which advises the state on the number of such injuries to the country ’ s 16th ranking .	-7.1639
Travel warning is also an answer to a new housing law that would make it more difficult to reach a company because of discrimination or employment .	-4.8912
Before that , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states adopted immigration laws , local law enforcement agencies were required to arrest people for migrants , which , in the view of the ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-7.0466
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.5176
Weimar is an elementary project .	-4.6172
The Fischbacher Weidlaun project is a success project and will continue in the coming year .	-4.7340
Peter White and Kordula Kovac , a member of the French military , have received a picture on the spot .	-7.1303
At the Schwendemann family ’ s legal residence , representatives of the fishing bachbacher CDU community met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .	-6.5100
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his operation , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 suckler cows and many young animals , and houses guests in five apartments .	-6.0385
For him , the Black Forest milk is the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , so Schwendemann .	-7.8760
Only regional events will be on the table of the guests .	-4.8478
As he is also Chairman of the BLHV of Fischbach , he called the ' Environment Project ' .	-5.3388
I cannot grow to benefit from such steep areas .	-4.2787
There is a lot of work to do with the grassland area , and much more needs to be done with the engine consensus .	-6.6099
" We are dealing with the conditions and with the topography here , " emphasized Schwendemann .	-4.9305
In 2003 he took over his parent company and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not lead a biocompany .	-4.7397
For Mayor Thomas Schneider it was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weimar project and is pleased with the support of the lead party " .	-6.9578
farmers should be supported if they cost between EUR 3000 and EUR 4000 per hectare .	-4.0173
We hope that this will allow the afforestation of areas to continue for a long time .	-4.5742
" The greatest legacy we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to get their business further , " the mayor stressed .	-5.6755
Farmers are often criticised for their support .	-3.4774
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots were entered by 11 participants in the .	-4.1455
This leaves the area under 40 hectares , which must not be forests up to at least 2023 .	-5.8127
Half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was supported by Leander , a quarter that bore the municipality of Fischbach .	-5.8964
Thus , farmers have lost 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.2 km of wheat .	-4.9226
" The great advantage is the longevity of the fences " , explained Schwendemann .	-2.8342
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a good job without farmers and farmers it 's not going " .	-4.9521
Peter White also stated : " Here the best food is produced " .	-4.4844
The HüPR Tourist Workers Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables government support for womenswear .	-6.7710
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.1589
The precondition is the existence of a support framework defined by the LPR .	-5.1595
Moreover , the set-aside area must not be allowed to be leaner ( slope over 35 % ) and must be threatened with afforestation .	-5.9309
At the moment , eight participants with 24 parcells , who want to assemble nearly 16 kilometers , are now running for the Fischer bacher Weidlauinerproject in 2018 .	-9.3732
The cover area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-4.1733
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.7298
Now the White House of Trump is on the Statute for Freedom	-3.5448
The safest sign of regime change is when they start attacking statues .	-2.0818
Americans value these as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the summit of Baghdad in 2003 .	-5.9522
Stephen Miller , one of the Trump regime ’ s key ideologues , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated conflict with Jim Acosta of CNN ’ s proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration with the status of freedom .	-4.5363
To remain fair , Miller does not attack the statue itself .	-1.8503
A Horde of boat owners and liberty-Imanitis would have him brawl if he had done it .	-6.7199
But he took on its significance , and in particular the importance that she attributed when the famous poem was added by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-5.2256
As Miller Acosta complained : " I do not want to mention a complete thing about history , but the Freedom Statute is a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world .	-5.1309
The poem to which you refer later , which is not part of the original Statute for Freedom . '	-4.0727
Miller is correct , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.0708
It is about the contemporary response to the eloquent words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mothers , your poor , / your hard-pressed masses , who are longing to breathe freely , and / or generate the waste of your coasts ' .	-8.0126
There was never a time when the " idle waste " was better seen on our screens .	-3.1381
Miller was not committed to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome to Trump ’ s US .	-3.2498
This conflict because of the significance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural struggle : it is indeed a conflict over America ’ s importance .	-3.4873
Lazarus - and her friends who used to put their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they did a high political act .	-5.8453
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism , in a used classic style , that was women ’ s embodiment of freedom .	-5.7358
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , female figure is no longer abstract - she got a voice .	-3.9871
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of the exile .	-3.4897
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminine coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.1155
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wanted to change it for a long time .	-3.3296
The big cry , Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes the person to come to Trump , argued in 2010 that the Freedom Statute was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame into the universe that was put : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-8.5876
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .	-1.9696
The torch does not want to go into the United States . '	-3.9495
This is something unusual in my life .	-4.6798
The significance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception .	-2.1372
The great phantasm of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen from the exhausted , blackish , but desperate people after long and often horrific journeys on the decks of ships .	-6.8524
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-5.9641
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the welcome they have to hear .	-3.1006
That , of course , is not the outlook that Miller and Trump would ever want to acknowledge .	-3.6501
Their toracle is not to seek out the path , but to ignite the hatred that is its only source of power .	-4.3213
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black lobt Scottish members of the UK team .	-3.6016
Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scotts were among the British team .	-3.3365
The head of the UK 's athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-person Scottish contingent will make a massive contribution to the team .	-5.9662
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.8740
Black believes that ' developing something special in Scotland ' and the UK 's athletics must learn something about it .	-5.3998
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , " said Black .	-2.7910
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-5.0858
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.4131
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5465
And with the type on the street corner .	-2.4319
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.7118
Several of the Scottish athletes are Olympic candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route , while Eilidhy Doyle was elected by the team to captain of the team .	-5.6326
" Eilidh is fairly modest .	-1.7199
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.6834
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated .	-3.6769
The passion and the real feeling that the Eilidh brought quite naturally was great . "	-5.6141
The Commonwealth team , which will take place at its fifth World Championships at the 400-team , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-6.8212
To date , Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes in the World Cup was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.9696
In this way , the sailor , Muir , has drawn up five British and two European records last year .	-5.3371
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,500 m runners .	-4.6894
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1500 m , is another Scotsman who was to observe the victory of the British Team Trials and the Annie Games after a great season .	-6.3821
Doyle is reminiscent of her first World Championship , when the only other Scottish team at Lee McConnell was .	-4.1236
man 's advice on research tells us that it is " enormously proud " that many of its compatriots are not only members of the team , but in some cases also in the medals and in the finalists .	-8.5805
" The special thing about team research is that it was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me to make it very special for me , " she added .	-6.6737
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.6916
It only shows how far we have come .	-2.3101
And they are here as established athletes , athletes , who want to climb podium .	-4.0802
With regard to my speech as a captain ?	-4.0078
Yes , I think they went well .	-2.0159
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation as we have a home World Cup .	-3.7887
So it is really important to set this home support and to benefit from being back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.9573
I will get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-4.9537
Block critics about Facebook : Do not worry about a public office if you can ’ t fuel voters .	-4.0097
The father of our country knew something of poor press .	-1.9058
The Americans loved George Washington , but it didn ’ t take long for newspapers to beat him from domestic politics to political principles .	-3.6570
He vaccinated the criticism , certainly .	-5.2897
But he has not silenced his critics .	-0.7503
After all , in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb , we are being fought for slaughter like sheep ' .	-4.8134
This brings me to Maryland , Governor Larry Hogan , who needs to work to be more like Washington .	-3.9252
Hogan ’ s employees blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and deleted their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.7615
And the American Civil Liberties Union put it at the beginning of this week .	-3.3527
The Board of Governors dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online commentary was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.9680
" It is just Facebook " , said many people .	-2.0381
But it is important .	-0.9491
And it is especially important if it is a type like an pants .	-4.3933
This is a Republican governor in a overwhelmingly democratic state , which is remarkably popular .	-3.4300
He has the second highest agreement of the 50 Governor of the Nation .	-2.7145
Hogan is not a reactionary hot person .	-2.4628
It has shown a firm hand in guiding its state and strict adherence to principles .	-3.9198
He was also very clever about using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and to debunk his hair hair after chemotherapy on his side .	-6.4842
That is why the blocking of people coming on the side of the governor - a public forum called official , and of staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.6146
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than a moderator .	-3.8535
But it is too easy to use the image of Troll or Spammen or hazelated people who flash online .	-5.5563
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.9627
And these are just real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , not a trolls .	-3.2754
You all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not professional .	-1.9357
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and called upon Hogan Catholic faith .	-3.0884
lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , MH , was not hateful , but she asked for hate crimes .	-3.7467
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the news " The Post " .	-2.8069
" I do not appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some people do not regard it as a so-called collective use and are not recognised as a large group of citizens affected . "	-7.4263
What the governor ’ s employees call ' concentrated ' spam attack ' would probably call others ' talking .	-5.4295
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deselecting a negative comment .	-3.1300
It is much cleaner than it did in the past if one had done the same thing that employees were to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-6.4658
But that is precisely what is happening digitally .	-2.0459
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for using Facebook and other social media .	-2.2615
President Trump is being sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his tweet .	-2.7644
One of the first milestone on this issue came in Virginia last week .	-2.9627
The leader of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US law reporter James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she sold a voter from her Facebook page .	-5.6921
And in Kenya , Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for its use by Facebook and Twitter .	-3.6408
That should not be so difficult .	-1.6518
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable Portos had a similar impact as the Internet .	-2.9528
The number of newspapers varied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letterwriters suggested his leadership .	-3.3328
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-2.4481
The people who used Psedonyme like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-4.6094
Petitions denouncing his position on the treaty of Amity , trade and shipping with Britain were overwhelming , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project Online Papers .	-4.5541
But he has not silenced it .	-1.5302
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation .	-3.1220
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.0586
Ronin Raffality hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club .	-4.4033

Fewer lung cancer through passive smoking	-1.1043
Over the past two decades fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking .	-2.6421
This result is a study of scientists from the University Hospital of Hamburg-Epsdorf ( UKE ) .	-4.2292
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are due to passive smoking per year , " study leader Heiko Bescher said .	-3.2432
As a comparison , he carried out his own study on this issue in 1994 .	-4.2851
At that time there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking in Germany .	-3.0912
The new investigation is published in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-2.2759
Domestic connections prove to be complex .	-3.5035
The construction works in the Villinger street are in full swing and " situated reasonably in time " , so the head of the building house Fred Heinze .	-6.7334
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than anticipated , as much ground ground ground pollution is missing , which is not covered by plans .	-6.3389
The traffic , which constantly prevents construction works , is a major problem for the building mechanism of the Stumpp company .	-4.9724

More than 3 % said that security control on sci-fi content was safe , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs to the plane .	-7.2071
The company said that it had questioned travellers around the country to find out how many accidental smuggling products had been brought through airport safety and how many of them had deliberately done .	-6.1457
It is no surprise that the people who are most likely to wear by safety - consciously or unconsciously - were those who fly the most .	-7.5458
However , the company points out that TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.1664

Elon Musk , it doesn ’ t matter : tens of thousands of tesla customers cancel order .	-3.7921
Electric thousands of final sassa Elon Musk will be happy to present you with the enormous number of reservations for his new model 3 .	-5.9870
He has so far rejected the fact that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-4.8926
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even gigantic sales targets , Tesla-CEO Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed a different , less impressive number in announcing the latest quarterly balance : cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-8.1414
Musk had often promoted more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery just begins .	-5.9314
Now mus accepts one : Of the total of 518,000 reservations , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-5.9959
Critics have always pointed out that this is just a no-obligation reservation .	-3.8841
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay 100 Euros ( US $ 1000 and <unk> 1000 ) " reservation reservation reservation " in the United Kingdom .	-5.6425
There are currently 45,000 non-binding reservations , while Musk has a telephone conference with analysts .	-5.4988
The failure to cancel about 12 % of all orders to date does not , however , do not believe the Tema chef .	-6.6625
Its argument : the challenge to ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-2.8259
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.8597
In 2018 , all models come together , it should be 500,000 , 2020 is one million .	-4.0706
There is obviously a demand for this .	-2.6984
There are currently 1800 reservations per day according to the Musk .	-3.6271
Those who order a model 3 today should expect delivery early in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla is able to drive its brand new production routes , which have never been tested in practice , without major interruptions at maximum capacity .	-7.4577
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.3859
However , if there are major delays , the inevitable reservation may become the problem for Tema .	-5.4634
If so , the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves .	-5.5003
EPA boss Pruitt is retreating from the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions .	-5.9419
A day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the Environmental Protection Agency ’ s CEO , withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog substantial air pollution .	-6.2892
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to meet the needs of government authorities in response to reactionary commuters than before .	-5.0036
He did not mention the legal case which had been raised against his previous post in a Federal Administrative Court .	-5.2299
It is a deadline set for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standard for ground ozone .	-3.7149
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time , study the plan and avoid " intervening in local decisions or impeding economic growth " .	-3.5039
Pruitt , who was a reliable opponent of tougher environmental legislation before he was appointed by President Donald Trump ’ s public prosecutor of Oklahoma for a long time .	-8.0208
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly sought to block or delay regulations that oppose the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .	-4.4340
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitt regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.5850
Last month , a federal education court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane wells .	-4.9072
In an opinion published on Wednesday , Pruitt proposed that its about-turn on ozone standards simply increases the EPA 's readiness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with new standards .	-5.5141
" Under previous administrations , the EPA often did not meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by active groups and others , and in agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.8948
" We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings and we take time periods seriously .	-3.0725
We also take the law and the authority that we have . '	-3.0333
However , the opinion of the EPA stated that Pruitt will at some point use its ' competence to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on a solid policy and the best available information ' .	-4.9157
Congress Republicans are pressing for a broader version of the ozone rules .	-2.6227
A draft bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.4877
The measure was not yet put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.8858
The New York Attorney General , Eric Solderman , who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week , said that the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-4.6274
" The reversal of the EPA - after our complaint - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6,7 million New Yorkers , and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog who flows into their communities , " said Solderman .	-5.6473

The resulting smog can cause serious breathing problems for sensitive groups of people , and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-2.8707
Public health officials and environmental campaigners cheered at Pruitt ’ s surprising exchange of course .	-4.6095
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from those responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.9566

Association wants to verify approval of wind turbines	-6.0842
" Boisheim " is not a legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council .	-3.8203
The " Boisheim " association is strongly opposed to " , " said Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) , who has been invited to withdraw his authorization for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Nette .	-8.1049
It is illegal .	-2.0311
The club argues that at the time of the authorisation of 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette , no wind power plants could have been approved , as at the time of four only a wind power zone existed in the municipal boundary to Swalmtal .	-7.0754
Within this concentration zone , building and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but the concentration zone also causes the exclusion of energy use for the rest of the city .	-5.6251
These zones should prevent a " lock " of the landscape .	-3.5155
The city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nete a few days before , but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved , because of a design error .	-6.6588
" Due to the lack of planning a legal requirement , the granted authorization is still illegal and therefore withdraw " , Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim " said .	-6.0332
Latest things : before the summer break , the Town Council once again decided to concentrate the wind zone in the Boisheim Nete ; approval of the district government is still pending .	-7.1022
Erkens : " This means that the approval for the establishment of wind power stations is legally excluded at this point " .	-6.4998
The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .	-1.8790
" The corresponding letters have been added to the fourth circle since last week " , a speaker explained .	-4.4135
The group is taking it on the occasion of re-examining the matter .	-4.5464
But they are not likely to lead to a halt to the process .	-3.2628
With a view to ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the " Boisheim 's argument " .	-5.7583
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four per 200 m high wind turbines on an area at Boisheim Nete .	-5.0277
Last year , the company in which the city of Viersen was indirectly involved had concluded lease contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares of land .	-4.9303
With the construction of four wind turbines , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be covered - equivalent to around a fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households .	-6.7193
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.1379

Bad Langensalzer and people from the region are expected to discover shopping in the city centre in September .	-4.8090
The trade association and the municipal council want to take advantage of the weekend on 8 and 9 September to lure the inhabitants into the city centre .	-9.7213
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian King , announced , the " Heimenschaft " weekend shall inform customers about the offers that keep their city away from the usual supermarket goods .	-6.8445

In addition , domestic firms are expected to present themselves with their educational locations .	-4.3795
In addition , the downtown business should invite to the " midnight shopping " .	-5.0346
The campaign aims not only on residents of the city and the region .	-5.3915
In preparation there are commercials on the radio , an internet video and prints of bags pointing to the action weekend , Christian King .	-5.5401
The municipal and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-3.9122

These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " for the Brunnen Festival , with the sale open Sunday , discussions with all the traders and hosts to make them active .	-6.8977
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the absence of parking fees this day are part of the concept .	-2.6112
In addition , customer potential is to be newly or re-developed .	-4.0293
These include spa guests and tourists .	-3.0910
But even many locals would have lost the city center when shopping .	-4.2914
In the end , everyone should contribute to the development of the city centre - to rental , to the companies of the whole city and the associations .	-7.7478
King said in the spring that he had to overcome the lethargy with a network that had made some progress .	-5.7021
Birgit Stronger , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , said that there were five Thumben cities involved at the federal " Heimenschafringer Day " .	-8.7352
In addition to bath Langensalt , this is Weimar , Sömmida , Heiligstadt and Blecherode .	-5.2886
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities ' , so stroke .	-5.7806
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her direct environment with his buying behavior .	-4.7807

Trump pressed for leaked transcription of phone calls Mexico for payment of the border wall .	-3.4857
Translations of calls by US President Donald Trump and Mexico ’ s and Australia have been published by Washington Post .	-3.8887
On 27 January , on a phone with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump asked that he should not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.8993
The US President attacked him because he publicly denounced the wall , saying to him : ' You cannot tell the press ' .	-4.2819
Trump began his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and swore to pay Mexico for the project .	-3.6262
Transcription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-4.2570
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would take over refugees fleeing to Australia " laughable " , " rents " , and " stupid " , and that the trade that the Obama administration told him would look like a " depp " after he proposed a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-8.3940

Moors Ford-Masses : Activists are reeling racist Lynch as a call for justice .	-6.5680
A 1948-er Ford Mercury sailed by a group of viewers in rural monroe , Georgia , and corrupted to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-5.0768
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men came out with guns to block his way .	-4.2803
The leader of Mobs - a middle-aged man in a needle lane - took a long train from his cigar and looked through the windscreen .	-4.6637
Inhabitants of this species have grown in fear .	-5.6763
" We want this n --r Roger ! " Gentle the man .	-4.5589
" Hol it out of the car ! "	-3.6540
The cries break the silence when a young black man was torn apart from the front-passenger seat .	-4.2309
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a follow-up .	-3.7668
But if a slew is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost all of the public run out very real sighs .	-5.0564
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to reflect the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-5.5303
Nobody was ever prosecuted for the murders .	-1.8804
" It is truly incomprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyarson Brooks , who helped organize the post .	-5.7764
" It is a filthiness on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.9545
Brooks was a 19-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights activist .	-6.7076
For him , the follow-up serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual reminder of the monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.3538
" We want prosecution , we want to end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , " he said .	-3.7237
" We cannot achieve reconciliation and healing until we get justice . "	-2.8090
A court physician sets a bed towel on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynst on July 27 , 1946 .	-6.1014
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the writing process .	-4.1034
But no one has ever been charged .	-2.1634
Although the suspects have remained open for decades , civil rights defenders say that the dual motivation for the Lynne ’ s actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-4.4553
In April 1946 , a ruling by the Supreme Court made it possible for the first time for the black citizens of Georgia to vote in the preliminary election campaign in the summer .	-4.6057
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI , Roger Malcom had a white landowners , Barnett Hester , during a fight - supposedly for a woman .	-4.9203
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcoms Mrs Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not taken by her husband .	-6.4655
On 25 July 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowners , paid $ 600 to liberate Malcom from prison , the FBI .	-3.6593
He was put to prison by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-5.9953
But when she moved away from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob moved the car .	-3.1309
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " this concludes a FBIE report .	-5.8451
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between the state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the killing , destroyed evidence and covered the identity of witnesses " .	-5.4392
Brooks makes it even more concise .	-3.3802
" It was a polling massacre , " he said .	-2.0993
" You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you register and if you vote , that will happen to you . "	-3.8835
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene conducted the annual exhibit of the Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-4.4973
Her presentation is , in fact , deeply rooted in a kind of deep racism , many of which believe that he does not exist in America .	-6.9643
It is difficult to watch and look harder , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.6540
" We don 't want to talk about the gimmick , because we are confronted with its ugly state in all of us , " she said .	-4.8394
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did .	-3.6170
The samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - entered a room and applauded when Greene started a good overview of the piece .	-5.9588
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-Director .	-1.9729
He has been playing the role of chief clan for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-4.3765
" I feel dirty because I am not so " , said Marbaugh .	-2.1393
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-2.8789
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester tested their lines .	-3.5394
The piece begins with Malcom , the Hester picks up and slashes him , angry that he had slept with his wife Dorothy .	-6.1940
" I said n --- he , winded of my property ! "	-3.3058
The fire is quick to reply .	-4.1014
There is a pause .	-1.0739
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks in Laughter .	-4.0106
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.7604
" What ? " , asked Rascona .	-4.2569
It is alarming and confused .	-0.8761
Was I too harsh ?	-1.6625
" No , " said Greene , still kierd .	-3.7358
" I simply do not think that white people then ' n --- he ' said . '	-3.3966
" But " but " funny one of the other black actors .	-3.0511
" You just have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-2.0140
And that is precisely where energy is shifted in the room , a feeling of friendship replaces the feeling of unease .	-6.0487
Everyone is concerned to get this added right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .	-4.1433
The scene begins again .	-1.2809
This time , when Rascona says the word ' yes ' , he says it strongly and emphatically .	-4.2375
There is absolutely no one laugh .	-3.3454
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-1.9766
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-2.0494
A woman dressed with a marriage is above the corpses of the actors and leads Billie Holidays 's distractions of " Strange Fruit " .	-6.8750
Your voice breaks at each second word .	-2.7221
About a hundred meters behind it is a group of about four dozen spectators of welding and tears .	-3.6115
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .	-1.8239
A pair is from Ithaca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many come only down the street .	-4.3067
They have experienced temperatures of almost eight hours long in Georgia when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage to the graves of Malcoms and Dorsess .	-7.4836
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdotal , but now , when one stands on the same land where the Lynch-murders took place , the air feels divided .	-6.4820
When the last notes of the song finish , Greene invites you to come closer and place the glue name .	-5.2827
Children hop on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and whisper each other .	-3.8104
" They are not really dead " , he murs a young boy when he would like to remember it .	-4.7922
After a few minutes Greene thanks the quantity - and suddenly it 's over .	-3.2865
The actors throw the Lynch away and wipe their tears .	-3.3686

You did so for one reason ' .	-2.0626
Later , the audience met for dinner with the actors .	-3.7485
At a table , a white pair of Atlanta mocked on the post with a black pair that they have just met .	-6.2680
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words which sense the performance has left .	-2.5203
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... come from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , " she said .	-3.5711
" What really does this with me , let me believe that the Lynne still goes on , " she added , " today this is just called the police officer . "	-6.3948
In the same room , Tycartridge Brook Hof keeps on his table , he eats and recalls citizens ' rights .	-6.1675
He said he already started to plan the performance next year .	-2.6625
" The end is , in a way , inspiring , because it describes the horrors of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.2554
" It is so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-5.6862

The appearance of Frank Castorf and his team were eagerly awaited .	-4.0098
In 2013 , he had to leave an ordinary dard concert , and five years later he had great celebrations in which the parade " Buh " went .	-8.7193
Festspielschote Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .	-4.3632
" One noticed that the audience had grown together with the " Ring " in a way , " she said shortly before the performance of the dpa .	-4.5531
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but it has also grown an understanding of this view .	-5.6599

The Community Area Council	-2.6553
In the end , the decision was clear : in two votes , the Municipal Council of Transport Wints decides to set up a Community area in future homes for the elderly .	-6.1652
Before the discussion , there is an important information : signing the purchase contract for the still missing land , Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reported .	-5.7377
While it will still take until the area of local ownership , as previously known , there is no plan to prevent the project from being run by a private investor .	-7.9807
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-2.7297
One of the two investors who are still in the boat has offered to come home to the community .	-3.5898
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-3.5782
The administration and the majority of the Council of the Council are in favour of such a Community area not only as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the entire population , but as an open place for the community .	-9.0815
As an example , the word " Strickcafé " made the round .	-3.2629

Construction is in the area of restoration .	-2.7775
The creation of a Community area would , according to Tjaden , be eligible for 60 % of 30 % .	-4.0704

Go to the Harz of Stern	-3.0705
In the Harz area the first " trail " will be created .	-5.0747
This is the plan of the organization Stern LaurlauSankt Andreasberg .	-6.1675
A planetary road is found in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-3.2990
A " trail of stars " meets the need for information from many visitors to Harzattended , it was said .	-4.8778
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.0642
The members want to create along the planned route panels and inform them about stars and star pictures .	-5.3447
In a first phase until 2018 , the club plans to " achieve usable installations in five to six places " in the Oberharz .	-7.6697
Cross the river at St. Andreasberg .	-7.8563
The information on the panels is to be added to the Internet .	-3.8599
For this reason , a good mobile network reception is playing a part in the selection of sites .	-5.9816
Freedom of accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.4320
Later the Star Trail is to be extended by train .	-4.5426
" The observer learned a lot of interesting facts about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-6.0260
In addition , they learned why stars had different colors , or why a star is more bright than another , even though it is far more distant .	-5.8572
Communication is also in which constellations a selected star is located and when it is best to see .	-6.2541
Since 2014 the club has been operating in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg the highest Sterilien in northern Germany .	-7.1339

The grooves with the individual planet - including the degraded Pluo to the dwarf side - are positioned exactly at the distance and level of one to two billion .	-6.4690
The Earth is thus shrinking to a ball of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away sun is measuring 70 centimetres .	-4.0093
The total distance of the planetary flux is four kilometers .	-4.1579
While the light takes about eight hours from the Sun to the Pluto , pedestrians need a good hour to the Stele with Pluo .	-6.8807
Thus , pedestrians are faster than light in the world .	-2.8817

" I am a former spring weight , " said Garcia .	-4.0767
" I went for Broner [ 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-4.2101
I am small for 140 .	-1.1210
I want to lower the weight of light .	-2.4707
And he must move toward lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then fight .	-3.7263
That is what fans are asking for .	-1.5787
Let us give them that . '	-1.2317
Lombardiko agreed .	-2.8042
'boxes need this battle ' .	-3.6056
Climate question whether it should be on Pay Per-View , part of a strategy that must fight Lomachiko with a 135-pound debut this year to arrange a date in the next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) , which also has interest in the fight against the winners of Jorge Linares-Luke Campell on their lightweight bid in the title forum on 23 September .	-8.0270
" This battle could take place in the pay-per-view mode , because all the fans asked for it , " said Garcia and later openly expressed themselves to fight in the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.5460
We are the best .	-0.6441
No other name can generate this kind of attention .	-1.7488
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.3313

Four Injuries to tyre users	-2.1962
In the event of an accident on the A7 , four people were badly injured on Thursday afternoon .	-3.3252
After the first information , the driver of an Opel Zaeia lost control over his vehicle at 16 : 30 , just before the port of the market , presumably after a tire user .	-7.8797
The car quickly turned into evil , where it was overflight and then left on the roof .	-6.9498
The four occupants - two adults and two children - have been badly injured in the accident .	-2.5008
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour , then the traffic could be bypassed on the left of the emergency .	-5.3195
Fortinas Hoffmann : " Trierkette works better " .	-3.6124
After 2 : 2 for the season , Andre Hoffmann hopes to see the optimisation of the defensive information in Aue points .	-5.2994
With the first season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , and would not have been the two opposite of the second : 2 .	-5.3030
" These were two opposite too much , and we need to be more careful in Aue , " says the defensive player of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-4.3395
In the Erzgebirge Mountains the Dreicette is also to be improved .	-4.5797
And a gate after a collision no longer wants to ignite .	-4.9782
" For the future , it will be the case that no one goes along with Michael ( leasing ) . "	-6.1857
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also be able to cope better after the experience in the preparation with the trimbette than with the Viererkette .	-8.1560
" Still I don 't know how we are going to get in Aue " , says his trainer Friedhelmet Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , " because we have just in the triangle on the semi-positions in Kazan Ayhan and Niko Gießmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-7.1195
" It is necessary , but that we do better to harmonize and that we do not do so many mistakes in the construction . "	-8.5085
Naturally , Hoffmann also moves to Aue to win the game .	-2.3830
" But if you can speak of a failed start , you don 't know .	-3.5123
The service could be OK , " said Hoffmann .	-4.4347
" But if we are on Sunday with four points and can focus on the Pokal , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal act . "	-5.8597
His trainer wanted to know nothing about this .	-2.4588
" I first judged the start of the season after six to eight days ' , " Friedhelm Funkel said that he did not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the match of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be stopped prematurely because of an uncompetitive one .	-8.0542
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann think that players from Aue might be even more fresh , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Formal against a rising favorite in the bone .	-6.3959
" But they do not know as 100 % where they are currently standing , " says the inner distribution of the Fortuna .	-4.6999
The guests from the Rhineland , as a light favourite , will finally go to the meeting in the mountain ( almost ) prepared stadium of Aube .	-7.1799
" That we throw them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is Blönn , " says Funkel , whose track record is very positive about defeat against Aue from nine games .	-7.0324
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga which must be beat from the start " , Foruntas Chief Koach explains .	-6.6545
'To make such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming ' .	-3.1367
So Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday in any case .	-4.5994
New results of Swedish asylum age testing	-3.7440
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.8845
The Swedish authority on Forensic Medicine ( Secttery Discreed ) started the tests last year .	-6.5908
They are to make the assessment of old age more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Migration Agency has been criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees , who were inferior .	-8.4992
To this day , the Forensic Medicine Agency has sent 6.880 tests to test cases , and has now released the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-4.9796
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency reported that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-5.2274
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-3.3689
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person 's age is called into question .	-2.2329
According to Johan Görsson from the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been steadily in recent months .	-3.4509
" We see no great difference in the statistics of the last few months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.7357
The high proportion of cases in which the person was assessed for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers lied about their age .	-5.2226
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases which " propose that the person studied is 18 years or older " .	-2.9847
When the newspaper Svenska Dagblad studied the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she was 18 years old this year .	-4.6475
The method of medical age evaluation , in which X-ray images are made of white teeth and MRT photographs of knee elements , which are then analyzed by dental doctors and radiologists , has also been criticised in some .	-7.6899
One of the skeptics is the endokerologist Claude Marcus of the Karlinka Institute , whose work consists of assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they were previously or later than usually consumed by puberty .	-7.5633
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.3098
To judge the biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-3.1426
If we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-3.9921
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low . are , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6715
The biggest risk is that if the person is just under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.9248
Full plan	-1.2401
The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well underway .	-3.8634
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.8302
" We are very good at the time it runs super " , says Reinhold Light , Construction Manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the government Headquarters Freiburg .	-5.2271
In April , work began at the same time on all three refraining bridges between Schramerg and Laufenbach .	-3.5937
The construction end is scheduled for October and it is clear that the timetable will be met .	-4.4030
The first bridge , coming from Schlazberg , leads via the Trombach .	-3.8009
It is a steam locomotive made of concrete which is covered with red buntstein and has a total length of 4,80 meters .	-6.2982
It was built in 1900 .	-0.6431
Like the other bridges , it has come into the years .	-3.8512
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three structures are now thoroughly reinforced .	-4.5068
The other two bridges lead through the Lauterbach .	-1.9907
They are made of red bunker coons .	-4.4880
Both were built in 1939 and were twelve , or 10,60 meters long .	-2.5719
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning on the northern side of the town has now received a 1.30 m large and seven tonnes of what is known as a bridge .	-7.5073
This is a marginal attachment which is also used as a business way .	-3.1686
On the southern part of the bridge , a 2.20 m long bridge will be used on Friday .	-3.8696
That is what the pedestrian road is meant to follow .	-4.4014
The special thing is that these are components , a patent of the Schramber company Dizwo .	-4.4710
The other two bridges are already connected with patented bridgels .	-3.0952
The gap between the wall and the Lauterbach is particularly noticeable .	-8.3759
Because there is also a glass fibre cable to which many companies are connected .	-3.3761
The inhabitants of the city were informed in advance of the work by means of direct ballot on the project .	-6.2460
In addition , fish and cancer first had to be fished .	-2.5029
For the bridges between the building building building and the factory in the direction of Schlramberg , traffic is regulated fairly quickly by a traffic light .	-6.5488
The road in the area of the bridge is completely closed to the " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " .	-5.6434
The cost of the three bridge installations is EUR 700 000 .	-2.0958
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-2.4947
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protests at German potato salt .	-2.6280
It is not so often the case that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative to Germany ( AfD ) , what is hard to get together .	-5.9626
The parties represented in the Kreistagtag ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , left ) belong to a broad alliance that , on this day , shows peaceful flag , because the AfD is invited to the poster of the " big campaign act " in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell .	-7.3464
And well known names to start - like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the top duo for the federal election on September 24 , and the Vice-Chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-5.3764
But those who are already on the ground hours before the event do not want to listen to the African-Americans , but to demonstrate .	-3.9426
The motto " The Eifel remains colourful " .	-1.1962
Originally , the city 's picnic was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place on the car park below the Rondells - and immediately before the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-7.8386
A colourful picture here .	-2.8803
And what Christina Karli , chairman of the Forum A World and one of the leading organizers , is right : " Toll as many people have come here together " .	-5.3015
There are music and a lot of food , including a " urGerman potato salad , which could also easily eat the AfD , " says the woman who brought it .	-5.1534
The police have entrusted many officials to Gerolstein , but it also shows presence at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-6.4373
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.8640
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcano Summit reported that he sought such an event and received the prize .	-5.9059
The 45-year-old Gönnersdorf had initially asked for it in Daun , but there was a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built Laurentius .	-8.6285
So now Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.7630
With a view to the event at the Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the right of people , mainly , it remains peaceful " .	-4.2240
This is also true : at the Rondellvorplatz a band provides entertainment , in the city hall a variety of speakers , including the rhein-in-ripened Afzische D-Chairman Uwe Young .	-9.7463
Some 200 listeners in the hall are waiting for the top candidate for the German election in Alice , e Weidel , and the deputy head Beatrix of Storch hold their speeches .	-7.0109
The police presence is incomprehensible , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.0432
A little more than an hour the AfD event , the guests at the entrance have been given a long breath , but there is also a short stop after 9 p.m.	-9.5875
The police can turn away - no special events .	-3.6979

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.0300
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8030
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.2324
How can consumers protect themselves ?	-1.2183
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-3.2596
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect himself from poisoned eggs ?	-2.0287
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamps .	-3.3838
At the Consumer Protection portal www.Food Security hands.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the egg chargen involved .	-7.9214
The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.9269
Even if everything we know at the moment is practically excluded from health risks .	-3.6524
Now Aldi takes over the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Minister of Economic and Monetary Affairs is not really recognized ?	-4.7204
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .	-1.8713
Nevertheless , my House has immediately turned its attention and has been known since Germany 's involvement in close exchanges with the authorities of the countries .	-6.7002
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.5762

Unpolluted eggs can be sold and eaten .	-4.1686
This time the companies are not to blame .	-2.3428
Is manufacturing and consumer sitting in the same boat ?	-2.2929
According to current knowledge , manufacturing companies are not immediately to blame .	-5.4578
Instead , they must reckon with economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-4.6848
As always , there are too few controls in the worst case .	-3.1769
Is it just a matter of personal competence or a coherent competence ?	-3.9679
It was , after all , the official controls that exposed the matter .	-4.0764
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be ruled out by 100 % .	-2.7552
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the prosecution services is of crucial importance in the cases where crimes are available .	-6.2308
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the competent authorities .	-3.2133
Is regular alarm about food scandals really necessary ?	-1.8778
Consumers have the right to obtain food which is only safe and accessible .	-3.9312
When a non-approved insecticide is used in food industries , consumers are rightly outraged .	-4.3382
The money that has been invested has brought manufacturers , retailers and consumers into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .	-5.8876
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticides Fipronil in the position of concentrated animals is unacceptable and must be ended immediately .	-6.6835
This must be done consistently and with high pressure .	-3.0057
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the situation is quickly and completely resolved .	-4.0941
How the soccer financial rules affect Paris on the Nemars move	-3.9068
The rules aimed at preventing the unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not interfere with Nemars ' world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-9.3763
Some of the consequences will come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the leading organisation that monitored the European game has the power to prohibit teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-6.2992
Financial fair play rules , which were set up by UEFA in 2011 , mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer from the Nemar was financed without great losses .	-5.1810
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its treaty , and the Nemar will receive a salary of several $ 10 million per year .	-4.2615
Here are some of the financial aspects of Nehors move to France .	-2.4443
PSG can safely loose the money so that Nemar underplays and puts him into another galaxy , given the financing of the team by the energy-rich Blade family of Qatar .	-7.2074
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the purchase of players , but must compete with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to play the spot in their football related business .	-6.4979
FFP was designed by Michel Platinum after his presidential election in 2007 .	-3.7274
Former French players believed that clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success were effectively swindle and risked ruining themselves if banks or owners were stepping back .	-6.7422
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentration on the debts of the club to monitoring its losses .	-3.4000
The change meant that the business model , which originally used the novel Abramovivich in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential , and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand , should become a harsher affair .	-4.5479
During the current three-year FFP period running until 2018 , clubs can accept losses worth EUR 30 million .	-3.6365
And , although platinum fell in love by the presidency in 2015 , his A-successor Aleksander Cefern continues to fight out of excess spending .	-4.9626
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.6887
Although the SPG paid the Nemar buy-out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .	-5.2677
The General Terms and Conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany and the of Germany .	-10.7642
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has been severely hit by the sanctions .	-3.0977
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Championship to be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-4.9161
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist its financial supervision by plunging its revenues from companies connected to the owners of a club .	-5.5183
While a catarina company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income .	-4.9119
That was what happened in 2014 when UEFA decided that the value of PSA 's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.8905
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Nemar could come about payments from the Organizing Committee of the 2022 in Qatar .	-4.6199
But PSG and Qatar in 2022 have disputed that Nemar World Championship ambassadors will become , and that such a manoeuvre could easily be discovered for the UEFA regulators .	-5.7951
Previously , sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.6073
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Nemars transfer , proclaimed on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-4.2811
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , because they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.4882
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-4.0764
The accounts for the last financial year must be published .	-2.4644
PSG expects the Nemaris arrival to be a boon for sponsoring contracts , merchandising and tricossales .	-5.7469
The Association believes that sales after signature will rise by at least 30 % .	-3.4774
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and she tried to prevent Nehors from taking action by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-5.8024
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the Club of Javier and the State , " said the President of the League , Tema , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Kathars 's eventual ownership of PSG .	-5.2129
Arsenic Manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports Tycoons , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club .	-4.4429
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-6.2445
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.5821

Nostalgia goes into " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade detective " into the Nile .	-2.1749
This repetition of history is nostalgic for the glorious days of the 80-year-old characters , for the 90-year grunge era ( as the lead actor David Wain and Michael showold turned the comedy The State for MTV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Pohler and Paul Rudd went to much more things .	-8.3812
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and the enmity of our faceless era of permanent memory .	-4.6279
But as a franchise for Costasur it feels as though time was short .	-3.1597
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humors ( it contained an original story for an entertaining can vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-5.1263
By straying on the core of the gag - mid-age actors play children who grow up - they managed to get back to the last part of the widow .	-7.4466
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes beyond the realm of mystery , including a rib on the 90 's Stalinist film such as " The hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand , the hand that rocks the cradle " ) .	-8.4439
At one point , a character looked like an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.7498

The amiable Coop ( Mr. Showold ) , now Roman , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.9868
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.7301
And there is another crazy plot in which Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showold ) is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good sense of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.6328
As always , the digressions are the best part of the franchise .	-3.0487
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillons Underlibart of " Singles " , whose former Big-manon-Camp Andy now feels like an old craker .	-6.0478
There are the moments of accidental madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeated " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I thought to be a logical conclusion : " wet American Summer : Twtyminimum Yelars " , whose last scene will show the bonds how they will visit the movie premiere of " wet American Summer " .	-7.6895
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon now reminds us of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of The Americas , the film " Atomic Blonds " and even " GLOW " with its East-West combat iconography .	-4.3690
The comedy with Rhys Thomas , produced by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , is a director of being a TV series found : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two police officers as friends , two officers from Bucharest , fighting for truth , atheism and the way of Marxism / Leninism .	-15.0654
The main roles - a hard-lined Gregor and an idealistically IOd - are played by Florian Piersic , Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues of channing Tatum ( also a leading producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levante in English .	-6.2663
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.3748
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.5082
There are some nice gags to the image ( the police spend the time watching shots on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-5.2431
And the list of famous spokesmen , including Jenny Slte , Nick Offerman , Maherhala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny , creates a decent game ' Find out the voice ' .	-4.6109
But " Comrade detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a killer who is wearing a reactor mask - that it often plays like a single one .	-4.7562
There are six long episodes , and comedy is not fast or often enough .	-3.4524
" Comrade Detective " , which has been redecorated to a lesser length , could better deliver its Agitprops , as Gregor and Ivosf always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two big men who devour a heap of Hamburg .	-8.4938

In addition , the officials secure larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine , weapon , and hundreds of thousands of euros .	-3.8699
Two people were arrested at the same time as Raúl in Italy .	-2.4159
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects .	-1.6402
The two are presumably delivered to Germany .	-2.7077
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.5447
In total , more than 300 police officers were employed .	-2.6477
The members of the mafia are accused of organised drugs , severe acts of violence committed by murder and illegal and blackmail .	-4.5944
Since the summer of 2016 the public prosecutor has determined Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.7715
Between the public prosecutor 's offices in Konstanz and Palermo there was a flourishing exchange and investigators from the Kripo Rottbecause had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.1437
Thus , the large-scale deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-3.4873
In particular , Italy ’ s citizens , with a close relationship with the Italian mafia , were targeted at investigations .	-6.0442
Also an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , in which several shots were fired in a pub early in the morning , is likely to go to the account of the bonds .	-6.6571
complain of large loopholes in the immigration register	-3.7455
" Data from citizens who should not appear there " : According to a report , the immigration register in Germany is severely flawed .	-6.1748
This leads to some serious lapses in asylum procedures .	-3.9061
The Representative for the Federal Government 's refugee management , Frank-Jürgen , has drawn attention to a media report of large gaps in the list of immigrants .	-5.9466
The shortcomings in the data that are registered there may result in some serious lapses in asylum procedures and expulsions , warned in an analysis presented by the " Southern German newspaper " .	-7.5201
According to the register , ten million people are with foreign nationality , including 5.7 million from non-EU states .	-3.6405
The data will therefore be managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.0164
Because the data had not been properly maintained , the quality of data in parts has not been good until now . have and , , , , and , and .	-7.8524
In individual cases , data were found in 1921 , " of people who have not been in life for a long time , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register " .	-6.7026
'Intentional data inputs can slow return processes considerably , ' says the report further .	-6.2849
Moreover , in the statistics on forced travel , EU citizens are also registered who do not have to travel .	-6.6214
Such false contributions , however , resulted in " a distorted debate about how to deal with " travel agents " , in the analysis .	-7.4351
In the meantime , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families to Italy with 16-year-old children when they have arrived from there .	-4.4841
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reported by the " New Osnabrück Zeitung " .	-3.7970
According to the paper , the BAMF system " related to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - has returned to Italy since 1 June 2017 " .	-4.9234
It has been virtually impossible since the end of 2014 , as the newspaper suggests about the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.5195
According to the Dublin agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first .	-4.6528
If a migrant goes to another EU country , the state can send it back to the country of entry .	-4.5024
On the basis of the term , the term ' has now considerably increased the absorption capacity for families with under-age children in Italy ' .	-6.9689
Italy granted guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.7660
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( EGMR ) sees these commitments as sufficient .	-2.6811
Other EU countries would also send refugees there under the Dublin agreement .	-3.4903
The political spokeswoman of the left faction in the Bundestag , Ulla Yeltsin , criticised this decision : ' Families with children threaten to receive human rights illegal reception conditions in the Italian asylum system and threats to child welfare ' .	-7.0498
The second best result achieved	-2.6593
In total , 220 litres of blood from people living in upper reaches was already available to other people .	-5.2043
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-2.6060
All of them are Jürgen Greule , who now has 100 donations in exchange for 50 litres of blood .	-4.8450
Traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the community regained a multiple willingness to donate blood .	-8.4739
" It 's great how our body is designed for this and we give respect to the donors who make their blood available for foreign purposes even uninterested , " says Mayor Karheinz Kistner .	-6.7861
" A single donation helps several people " , explained the circle leader of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maifmacher , because the preservatives are merged into their components .	-6.3086
Three people may already benefit from blood donation .	-3.2069
At the same time , Maienacher reported about the actions taken in Oberreichenbach in spring .	-4.3235
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors " , said by the DRC Division .	-4.4808
Obviously , a few years ago , the change to the theatre house led to higher participation rates .	-4.3507
Before that , Thomas Boccktadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umberry , were among the multiple donors and received 50 blood donations each .	-5.5781
In half so many Herbert Mair and Dorothee Rixinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Scilieh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten ten per 500 millig of their life papers .	-5.6626
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 % .	-1.3264
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation has waned speculation about rising .	-4.9134
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " pro-income " when it sheltered interest rates on family incomes in the midst of greater pressure .	-4.6992
The Bank ’ s policymakers ’ Monetary Committee ( MPC ) agreed , with 6 to 2 , to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with less members expected to rise this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-8.1586
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % for 2017 and 1.6 % for 2018 , and warned that fiscal income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just 3 % in the autumn .	-3.9758
But they announced that , over the next few years , interest-rate increases would be needed to rein in Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , and she said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.9549
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut package , which was issued a year ago after Brexit .	-4.7586
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more within the framework of this system - with an estimated GBP 115 billion dying .	-6.7846
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the central forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on real household income continues to fuel consumption . '	-5.2561
At interest rates , they repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be necessary to cool down inflation and a ' slightly larger ' scale than markets expect .	-5.4371
The markets are currently forecasting the first growth in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.5061
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-3.5013
The Bank ’ s downward adjusted growth projections for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-2.9702
It has maintained its growth projections to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.8947
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro following this news .	-3.2595
The pound fell by 0.5 % to USD 1 31 and fell by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-2.6521
The decision to make no change is coming after the recent disappointing growth figures have increased expectations of an increase in interest rates and GDP has increased to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .	-5.6097
Growth is expected to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the bank will easily recover from the end of the year .	-3.4546
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small pay increases , because tightening will become even worse first before improving .	-5.7434
She added that monetary policy will not be able to " prevent income loss " in the next few years , but she added that wages will " recover " clearly at the end of their three-year plan .	-6.2930
The economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-3.3318
The decision will come one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the EU ’ s shocking vote which caused the pound ’ s decline .	-4.0050
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years before it will fully meet prices and the economy .	-4.3981
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , a call for an increase in interest rates had increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-5.1595
Last month , inflation dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that it was expected to resume in the coming months .	-4.3253
The Bank said that the ratio to its target was " quite " due to the weak pound .	-3.6955
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Morrow Brokers , said : " In the recent downturn of the Swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive once again , as the creditors are looking for shops strongly and want to end this year in a positive way .	-9.8701
The market looks particularly good for those who phase out the existing deals and close the new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular . "	-5.3598
NHS ( National Health Service ) is scheduled to charge controversial HIV drug for 10,000 people .	-3.9371
Patients from September will receive access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment after a battle before the High Court against the funding of the NHS drug .	-5.2280
NHS England announced that a pre-sexual predisposition ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection with high-risk patients by about 86 % , is now provided by the health service through a first three year study for 10,000 people .	-5.6232
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeals confirmed last year 's ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the EP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it .	-4.7726
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by the NHS British chief , Simon Stevens , as " important new intervention , " while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this a " crucial moment " .	-6.1368
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be one of the first to allow human registration , and other clinics will follow in October before it is introduced in April 2018 in the whole of England .	-4.6619
Preexposed prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-4.3135
Studies have shown that PrEP reduces HIV transmission significantly at risk of infection .	-2.8914
Taking the PrEP before intercourse means that there are enough medication in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-5.3392
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before intercourse .	-2.2269
Those who question treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexual and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.2003
In hospitals , appropriate participants who agree with the study will be identified , including men , women , transgenders , and individuals who have a partner whose status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatments .	-5.3038
People who live in England and who are registered with a family can register for possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-4.8544
The programme is signed <unk> 10 million and NHS England with a contract to deliver the medicines this week after competitive international procurement .	-4.8927
The study aims to assess the entire potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.7504
Stevens said : ' This major new intervention should complement and surpass the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.9126
It is another milestone in the progress made over three decades to address one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind . '	-3.9807
Devah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.6030
If it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people , the EU will be able to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.4832
From September to September , people with high HIV risks will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many lives .	-5.0452
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.3693
Ian Green , head of Terence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority now must be that the study is carried out quickly across the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-5.2438
Now that the PrEP test medicine was obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.0087
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : ' The start of the pre-accession process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow implementation by the government .	-4.6597
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and the transfer of this vital infection .	-3.3012
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-1.7676
It is important now that this study is carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will help us to get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society .	-5.6549
The great life lives : intermediate and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court house into a generous home .	-4.1976
Jeanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , fell from a big house in Knightbridge to a Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-5.3904
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joan did not store and sell her bags .	-3.7248
" I lived in front of my last floor in Knightsbridge in a much larger area " , says Joanne .	-5.2037
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-2.1529
I saw this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.3148
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day . '	-2.8452
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely outdated .	-3.8618
Originally a one-room-property with a nested layout - you had to walk through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add closet space and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .	-5.5205
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .	-1.6882
That was my request , ' she says .	-1.8972
To this end , she commissioned Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi ’ s architectural and design studio from Notting Hill , which used 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-6.4809
The ceiling was not large enough to accommodate two rooms each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand .	-5.4726
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-1.8435
" The steel work is rather complicated " , he explains .	-2.6888
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were hanging over each other without having to walk us .	-5.0786
It was not just about building a simple platform , but rather setting up the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-5.4823
This arrangement made it possible to connect two rooms full of each other - with a lot of additional drama .	-6.2834
For the intermediate floor a window of copper light from retrouvius looks down over the glamorous lounge .	-6.0282
Performed gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.3999
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .	-3.4463
A small corridor is mirrored on both ends to let it work longer .	-2.9875
In the kitchen mirrors are like a window in another room .	-4.0981
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all the corner and glasses of Joanne .	-4.8567
By perception of a glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.5248
Stackable kitchens are nothing new .	-3.8756
The special thing about this is that it is a garage .	-2.7251
" A bit of engineering went there " , explains Erfan of the reinforced , furnized MDF door .	-3.4886
" It is relevant , so if you push the door up , it is very easy to follow . "	-5.6248
Thanks to the clever use of space and closet space , Joan could gain an extra 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.8504
" At the end of the day you will sell the ground area - or how your property is estimated " , says Erfan .	-3.1486
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will stand up and calculate based on the size of the ground . "	-4.1446
Here they have managed to enlarge the ground floor and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-5.9428
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.5749
" You don 't fall into the walls of the electric outlets .	-3.6876
These are important but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.0512
It shows that a flat can be transformed by a good design and increased square metal selection from something else to something very astonishing .	-6.2332
Indeed , like Josanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-3.0700
Brothers struggle for a US $ 500 million real-estate empire	-6.9001
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute over one of the greatest real-estate empires of Victoras worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.7707
Former director of the ' Carlston-FootballClub ' and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his youngest brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to share property and business assets .	-5.0086
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp battle over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.8423
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-2.7552
The Westco Jeans family founded the family and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores .	-4.8419
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.1887
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the town centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in gold Coast and Mt . Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs .	-5.9011
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as the " principal operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of the company 's wealth and Paul approx .	-5.7239
A court case says that this means that Colin has ownership of $ 316 million and that of Paul , in the value of $ 176 million .	-5.4386
Separation of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-3.0276
" The misconceptions suggested by Colin have left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in a first Affidvit in 2015 .	-7.0214
Last Friday , after several failed accounts , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.4754
The brothers are now also fighting to control the current business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out .	-4.4252
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of managing some ownership incompetent .	-3.3884
In an early affirmative , which was tabled by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-3.8003
" My Italian heritage argues that the family is the main priority , " he wrote .	-2.4793
The costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with Affidvits , emails and reports of companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myrs , QC , and lawyers held by both sides .	-4.9924
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and the delicacy of the late 1950-er , who bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies .	-6.1914
They used the safety to buy the Collingwooden-property , in which Colin opened the first home of the family .	-5.4903
Colin says that he started there when he was " High School in my recent years , when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.4940
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons by their family .	-3.9542
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-2.3686
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis-Group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million when the company left its company and Luke 26 million dollars .	-5.0565
Both Lukas and Mark are , Paul says , ' on the terms of their financial separation ' .	-3.8473
Colin stood down very much , although he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography from Edden McGuiire the best friend of the television star .	-6.3947
FairMedia fax started contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-2.7854
Just Colin replied by SMS to say ' I really cannot say much ' because the case is before the courts .	-3.8242
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to drag our family name through the courts , " he wrote . and . are , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.2392
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.4450
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.5145
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.1336
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.6915
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.4366
Others tried and failed .	-1.1872
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-2.2274
If so , he will be the first .	-1.1101
Politically , the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including the news media reports , in the hope of keeping the head on an equal course .	-3.9605
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawey :	-1.8218
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior officials at his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he would like to repair : poor information that comes into the hands of the president .	-5.5872
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should go - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information ' .	-5.4429
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to harass Trump by monitoring his media skills .	-2.1539
President Trump ’ s relationship with television dates back decades – and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-5.6037
" If Trump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts that were convincing , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said in February against Politico .	-4.6533
Politos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keep Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media use includes a stewed praise . '	-4.6521
Okay .	-0.9179
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit ever was under control is ridiculous .	-2.4894
Perhaps these campaign leaders know something that we do not know to others - that without their interventions , Trump ’ s tweets would have included even more fuel .	-5.5858
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.2943
If his staff managed to stop anger from him several times , then their efforts were worthwhile .	-5.7246
But no one has been able to prevent Trump from provoking controversy .	-2.6611
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.0139
Politico - which deals with this history - reported in May on the preference of advisers to give the president questionable information for strategic reasons .	-5.6471
This was an example described by reporters Shane Goldmacher :	-1.8256
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is eager to determine where they come from .	-5.3511
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone in the president was effectively accusing the president of being a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief secretary Katie Walsh of being the source behind a bunch of leaks in the White House .	-7.0163
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for bullying , or that he had not provided any concrete proof , or that in the past he has voiced and revoke false accusations .	-6.4214
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh . "	-2.8562
Goldmakers added that the former Chief of Staff , Reince Pribus , and Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper kram that Trump receives .	-5.1972
How did it work ?	-2.2604
Kelly tried to do the same for three months later .	-2.6239
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Pribus , but Trump is still his pulse Self , and his advisers are still striving for influence .	-4.4309
These immutable factors make Kelly 's mission very difficult .	-2.0789
Most smuggled criminals receive a post from Europol .	-4.6420
As the address is unknown , the contact with the population is requested and desired .	-3.3114
Police across Europe this summer are sending out postcards to dangerous criminals .	-3.1467
As the addresses of the serious criminals in question are naturally not known , evidence from the population is hoped and requested .	-6.1143
On Friday , Europol reported the action following the " EU Most Wanted " adventure calendar of winter .	-4.1366

An anonymous resident said : " On Monday evenings , you went there after they were sent out from Bentley Heath , where they cast stones on the passers-by .	-5.1887
The Council must indeed be forced to implement by shame , because it was useless to deal with the problem .	-3.4784
Travellers were there in May , moved and are now back .	-2.4585

A local person who did not want to be called said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-5.6922
The figures have increased this time and even a horse in the parking area has been seen . '	-3.4977
A speaker from the Council of Solihull said : " We are aware of unauthorised storage on the land beyond the Street brook Road and work with the Police of Solihuls .	-5.3302
In order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many people living in the city report anti-social or criminal behaviour with the police by calling 101 . and the of , , , , and . are , , , , and . , and , , and , , , ,	-10.5243

From Birkenhof Waldhotel Lucie becomes a .	-7.9609
From the former hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Lucie is situated .	-4.2555
The house at the gates of Freud is now being renovated and will be opened on 1 March next year .	-4.9864
These are good news for the city .	-1.5867
After all , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente Betriegesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost each year and also income from the spa tax .	-6.8967
In the fall of 2014 , with the dramatic increase in numbers of refugees coming into the district , the hotel building was offered to the Office of the Council as a collective accommodation , which caused controversial discussions .	-7.5195
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a location for the hotel .	-4.3139
At that time , the decision was not undisputed in the Council .	-4.0603
But above all Freudident Oberbürger Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious visitors at the time .	-7.0324
He should be right .	-1.7222
The Lusenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherner , based in Bad Bergzaken , has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and intends to make it a home of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Lucie .	-6.9141
The group has four houses with the Freudistic object .	-2.4724
Two of them in Bad Bergzaken and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.1213
You will be called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Lucie .	-5.1123
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time now and when you enter the house you will see the extensive renovations that have been done .	-6.5874
The floors were cut , ceilings partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-4.4416
The entire hotel building is a single construction site .	-1.9993
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.8515
" It is really a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.5864
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.0612
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are installed .	-3.9397
Everything should be " very close to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer expresses .	-4.2680
" We want to make a jewelry job outside " .	-3.7484
Swimming pool , spa and meeting room are all equipped .	-3.3960
The location of the hotel was excellent .	-5.6437
The Waldhotel Lucie , with its 60 rooms , wants to expand significantly , explained by Scherker .	-6.4498
Both individual travellers , groups or business people will feel at home .	-4.4083
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause already , so Scherer .	-4.6564
The view of the city was similar to those of the hotel group .	-3.8119
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.8957
Thomas Scherker does not want to make a precise definition after the level of investment .	-5.7486
Nearly one million euros , it expects .	-2.6333
The front desk staff were also very helpful .	-5.8084
A large terrace is created in a courtyard which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is public .	-3.9645
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freud is a good market " .	-2.4605
Russia-affair : United States Special Councillor sets a Grand jury .	-4.8158
In the Russia-affair with US President Donald Trump , special counsel Robert Mueller is to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.7278
The panel has recorded work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " on the basis of people familiar with the matter .	-5.3351
The newspaper evaluated the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.4745
The CNN channel reported that there are already first charges from the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.8047
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-2.1640
Mueller is investigating whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-3.5290
The investigation should focus on several men who acted in the election campaign as adviser to the Republican Army .	-4.2643
According to reports , Mueller has also been researching more and more private Trump and business environments .	-3.0430
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Council , Trump , had personally come to the fore and looked at whether the President might have been obstructing justice in the course of the affair .	-6.2532
The main task of Grand Jurys is to check this evidence in possible crime and decide whether to charge .	-5.1354
Grand Jurys is therefore called Prayer ’ s letters .	-7.7408
They are usually turned on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-3.0449
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-1.9688
The body may also be contacted by the Public Prosecutor to load people to interrogate under oath .	-4.0387
According to the CNN channel , charges were already being raised about the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.6133
Those involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was said in the report .	-4.5285
They should also provide documents .	-1.1711
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner , as well as his campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were in conversation .	-4.1541
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment of Mueller did not intimidate himself and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .	-5.5957
But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand jury is finally turned on to decide on charging a charge .	-4.7803
But setting up the body is the start of a new phase in the investigation , and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-3.8052
In the midst of new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russian affair as a campaign for his political opponents .	-3.6050
" Russia 's history is a complete invention , " Trump said .	-2.3056
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about .	-3.9334
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand jury .	-3.8793
However , this work usually in secret he emphasized .	-5.4973
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Advisor in ' fair ' way .	-3.8424
The former FBI-boss James Comey said three times that the president would not be identified .	-5.1624
There was no reason to think that something had changed , it was said in the statement .	-5.0633
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey .	-2.2321
Because of this Raul , accusations against Trump have been levelled against him , he wants to obstruct the judiciary .	-6.7698
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-4.0140
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.4871
Following the presentation of US media , the White House collects material against the special counsel and its staff .	-3.5914
This triggered speculation as to whether Trump wanted to dismiss Trump .	-4.4571
Unlike an independent Congressional Special Councillor , such as the Watergate affair with the subsequent President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which , in theory , he could be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the request of the president .	-5.8451
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.7054
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators proposed legislation on Thursday , in which the special envoy could no longer be dismissed as simply .	-4.9091
Antarctica : Megantischer Eisberg is shooting in Antarctica .	-5.5151
In the West Antarctic , a giant iceberg has been resolved by the Schelderfes of roughly seventh size in Berlin .	-6.1866
The Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Arctic and marine research conducted on Wednesday .	-3.9776
The over a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers of surface debris now fall into the north and will probably need two or three years until it has melted .	-6.3378
It is one of the biggest ice giants registered by researchers over the past three decades , at 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-4.1147
He is not at risk for people .	-2.1027
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the downfall of the iceberg is unclear according to the information given .	-4.8723
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual fracture of ice clips in the region for about 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSAC ) in a faked background .	-5.4854
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-2.4026
The now broken behemoth has been part of the LarsenC-Schelfes .	-3.4446
Schelfes swimming on the sea is fed by large glaciers .	-3.3659
It therefore keeps growing into the sea and breaks regularly .	-4.3408
The LarsenC Schelfes is situated south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula .	-3.6963
Northern this shearing was disturbed by the equilibrium of wax and debris a few years ago .	-5.7192
A complete Schelfes is here , writes AWI-Forscher Daniela Janssen .	-4.3812
There is much to be said that LarsenC-Schelfes are at risk , because the front edge edge has never been as far removed as it is now .	-6.3773
Moreover , the ice plate is under tension and can fall if a key spot break a piece .	-4.8880
Melting chill-out and iceberg does not raise sea levels , as they swim on the water and replace ice as much water as it does after the melting of the ice itself .	-7.0679
However , loss of the Schelderwork leads to the glaciers flowing directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-6.1918
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , the UK research project for observing the Antarctic .	-4.7544
According to AWI , the LarsenC Schelfes is the fourth largest Schelfes in Antarctica , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.6165
The transition from the mainland is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres .	-4.7796
There it will break regularly .	-3.3260
" Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now in a dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Ley from the British Swan University .	-5.3645
" This is the greatest withdrawal since the beginning of the record , " he also confirmed .	-4.0518
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the LarsenC-Schelfes will now grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague , Adrian Luckman , added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-7.8753
But this development will take decades .	-1.8235
Even if these researchers do not reverse the collapse of this giant iceberg to climate change , the last few decades have shattered much of the Antarctic peninsula .	-7.5304
This long slider in Antarctica stretches to South America .	-4.9470
According to the British Antarctic Research Programme , the Antarctic Ice Region has fallen by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950 ’ s .	-3.0627
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline .	-2.5132
The Antarctic peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years , including among the areas where the temperature is the fastest rising .	-4.8805
CDU wants pets for personnel	-4.7141
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill loose positions , the CDU is demanding that the employer be expelled from the unions to become more attractive .	-5.9454
Only briefly before the summer break , the deadline for 41 new posts has passed through the administration .	-4.9836
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.3079
Now , once again , 17 apprentices have their first working day behind themselves . are , and .	-4.0603
The circle ’ s curricula are apparently highly sought .	-3.9854
Some 620 applications were recorded for the seats to be suspended this year .	-2.1548
Nevertheless , the circle still lacks staff to cope with increased demands and tasks .	-4.4699
At the moment , there are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann circle .	-4.1099
doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces are registered .	-4.2892
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the German Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) and the UWG to deal with the administrative deficit .	-6.3963
The administration should , according to the wishes of the parties , ' develop a concept for personnel production and development ' .	-5.9943
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of experts , but to counter the shortage of candidates in the future .	-4.4824
The overall concept should be based on both inside and outside , show concrete measures for cross-frontier workers and include a training offensive , CDU , FDP and UWG .	-6.6947
This sounds like a good approach .	-2.1412
The circle has to deal with personnel problems that you didn 't know before .	-4.5474
Other cities employ good officials and employees , offering more attractive terms .	-2.7920
We are talking about a genuine ' competition for public employers ' .	-3.6898
In addition , a large number of employees are excluded from the service due to illness or age .	-4.8310
So it is high time to act so that there are no more posts left out .	-5.0308
But Klass-Dieter Weihnachter , the CDU 's leader , goes beyond the joint motion .	-6.5724
In the district day , he recently made a false surprise when he publicly challenged staffing costs and surprised the other parties .	-7.6534
People want to see all the possibilities that enable them to leave the community of employers .	-4.6605
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the management of the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the cities in question - should aim for a house exemption " , the peoples .	-8.2111
Thus , the CDU is trying to better pay the employees and officials than actually provides for the system of collective bargaining for the public service .	-5.4776
The salaries are currently precisely prescribed , increases or more money is only available if you switch to a higher level that is geared to professional years .	-5.9168
But the challenge of the circle has grown ever more in recent years .	-3.0063
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new EWS Security Act .	-5.1871
Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , LandCouncil Thomas Hendele and director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .	-5.4998
Italy is tightening the tone for NGO migrants ’ rescue boats	-2.7701
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations .	-4.3359
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Marco Minniti , in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-4.2711
Minnitis warning came one day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German Youth Relief Agency , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.9387
The aid organization , which has only been in operation for one year , refused to give its opinion on detailed charges of the Italian prosecutor Amrogio Carmooio .	-6.0416
" For us , saving human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-4.5853
" We can only judge all the allegations currently being made after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . "	-3.9551
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of ' Youth rescued ' , Iuventa , since October .	-3.0615
It is suspected that his crew is taking flax migrants who are supplied directly from human traffickers and that the smugglers can be decommissioned so that ships can be used again .	-7.8159
At least one such meeting was allegedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of Public Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.4670
The occupation is suspected of defiing the authority of the Italian coastguard , the emergency operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons , not for any other motive .	-4.3224
Under the code of conduct , boats such as Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .	-3.2938
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.0806
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary , but acceptable , because they would not entail any ' major changes or obstacles ' of their bailouts .	-4.8217
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel Prize Organization Doctors without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.8125
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has dropped sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local citizens have borne fruit .	-4.7944
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the minister said .	-2.9566
He announced plans for further talks with Libya ’ s citizens this month on economic development initiatives , with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave them in the hope of reaching Europe .	-5.0072

Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-2.8848
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.9744
The Burg- and Wine Festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.8568
The first tour was performed by the Michael Chapel at the hot summer temperature along the vineyards above Deineheim .	-6.9847
Then there were viewpoint points , some on towers , from which you could look far over the sole forest and the surrounding plains .	-8.2629
There was a long tradition of catching up in between , for which the long trials were buried .	-8.1001
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to the Saline and the Roman-filled sausage market .	-5.8268

The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high holes .	-4.1842
The first Federal Counsel states have recognized this , which is becoming increasingly involved in this area .	-5.7419
In 2015 VfL Wolfsburg , then the FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart , founded an e-sports department in mid-July and included two professionals for the game FIFA 17 under contract .	-5.6543
" We hope to awaken the young target groups for the VfB , " says Managing Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.6503
He is sure " that there are still several clubs on this train " .	-4.7227
Next weekend FIFA World Cup will organise the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in London , where the gamer teams compete against each other .	-5.8754

" In particular , real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 years of age that young people will still go to the stadium in the future " , says the 52-year-old .	-7.2365
And : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.5902
With prominent athletes under contract , you could have more presence on these markets online than just send the Federal Government offices to Asia once a year .	-5.0925
What exactly is this all about ?	-2.0010
The e-sport includes computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterrike " or even the football simulation at competition level .	-5.2776
As in normal sport , leagues have long established themselves where professionals compete against each other .	-3.8895
And e-sports is already part of the official programme for Asian games 2022 .	-3.2765
But is it a true sport ?	-2.6278
For many , the idea is surely more common .	-4.1986
Ingo Froevil also dealt with the question for a long time .	-3.5046
E-Sport is a sport for the professor at the German Sports Academy in Cologne , because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that you can find in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.4081
Moreover , learning skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid reaction capability are needed .	-4.4586
Professional gamers should not only exercise the console , but also exercise their body and diet .	-4.1647
" The hired player is a good player . "	-3.3635
Frozen also sees problems : ' doping is becoming more and more an issue ' .	-4.5363
Controls are difficult to apply online games , and the scene did not have the classic sport structures .	-5.0554

A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment software ( BIU ) implies rapid growth in e-sport .	-5.3072
In 2016 , this means that 50 million euros were implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsoring , and big tournaments .	-6.0008
In three years turnover is due to be at 130 million .	-3.2222
That is a little against the EUR 2.4 billion in the football Bundesliga .	-4.7631
However , E-Sport is no longer far away from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " writes the Delotte advisor .	-5.9229
International are already many countries .	-2.7367
Large markets are Asia and the US , where former basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-4.6881
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the esports betting provider Unikrn .	-2.8557
There is also work in Europe .	-2.4964
E-sport has been introduced as a teaching device in a Norwegian school , says Froevil .	-4.2874
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , the first Bundesliga clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-4.0202

Just to fall into nostalgia , and to noisy the old times , is no longer sufficient today . are , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.8519

Michelle Carter condemns for the texts that urge Conrad Roy to suicide .	-4.3960
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-3.7326
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been suspended at trial .	-3.8938
Carter was condemned in June for careless killing Conrad Roy who died on 13 July 2014 .	-2.7932
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is volatile .	-2.4059
My son was my best friend . '	-0.7339
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .	-1.2353
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy had suffered from mental illness .	-3.6717
In red trousers and coloured blouse , Carter stood in the eyes , with tears , with folded hands and downward eyes when condemned .	-6.6519
" Her actions have been killing Conrad Roy " , the prosecutor said to the court .	-4.6502
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-2.6633
She did not take responsibility , " she said .	-2.2787
" She did not show a reunion " .	-2.7036
But Carter 's lawyer said that it is a " quite terrible thing that she completely regrets " .	-6.8279
But Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find that her " age or mature , or even her mental disease , have a significant influence on her actions " .	-7.6117
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy Roy Roy Roy Roy who said that there is " no day in which I did not receive the loss of my beloved son .	-3.9332
I would like him to be proud of me and how I am going around with everything .	-8.4673
Roy 's sister , Camrawing Roy , said she would be " persecuted of the knowledge " that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .	-5.5282
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together since my birth every day , is a pain that I will keep with me forever for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.4026
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to challenge another to commit suicide .	-3.0089
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide ship in a vehicle .	-2.4951
The case attracted national attention in itself , after hearing hearing from Friday ’ s texts revealed that it had encouraged him to end his life .	-6.9582
" Go on , spring from a building , make yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news that she had sent her to death in the two weeks before his death , while with his family on holiday .	-7.6769
In the eyes of his suicide she wrote : " You have to do it , Conrad and " All you have to do is activate the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-4.5651
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by Roy ’ s death and ordered that it should benefit from the case by any press .	-4.2459
The case has shared legal opinion .	-2.6633
One of the few who defended Carter , Amada Knox , who was condemned in 2007 for murder by her British co-girl in Italy before she was acquitted two years ago .	-3.5752

Joshua Kimmish : learn from the new Mini Lahm of the FC Bayern Munich .	-4.8033
The fact that Joshua kimmh was allowed to run the Audi Cup as the captain is not a coincidence .	-3.4984
The FC Bayern is promising a big season for the Confecd-Cup-winner - no extra motivation will be .	-6.6575

But , as far as the second day of the Audi Cup was , of course , not to be seen by Philipp Lahm and also no new Manuel , he kept the tie in his arms .	-8.1991
" The trainer didn 't announce it , " said the contest winner afterwards , after his first bet as Bayern-Krangehogen .	-7.6756
Good , the entry could have run better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-2.9541
But the character of the coach could also indicate kimmh .	-4.1519
In addition to the eight years old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a playmaker in the team of young players , debutants and straight out of the holidays .	-8.5905
In fact , sugar is best distributed to those who are eager to keep up with their spirits .	-7.5115
So anyone who has been chosen to visit Lahm 's heritage can only use a small extra motivation .	-5.3782
Kimmish confirmed : " This is what you want to assume as a player : responsibility " .	-4.0036
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old people clashed over the field as a mini Lahm .	-5.0044
To the right , that is now his position , the white connective on the arm did its rest .	-4.2866
And it was all that Kimmh worked in this starbase information like the one who can take the ruder out .	-9.3099
He gave instructions , tried to direct the unplayed force .	-2.3650
He had a look at the whole while many others were concerned about himself .	-4.6097
Vidal thus overplaying his lack of fitness ( not working enough ) ; Renaato Sans so , at Devil , go straight to the benefits of the trip in Asia ( usually only limited ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not falling negative in their first appearance at the Bayern-Tribeck .	-11.9929
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.0671
In addition to kimmh , Rudy ran out against defense , both agile .	-4.9461
The infamous trap of Napoleon was often hard , and it also tried to succeed a few times in the development of the game .	-8.1231
His colleague , Mr Rudy , said that the result was ' not as we hoped for ' .	-4.1889
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut .	-2.2251
modal shift , Tempowechsel : " For this style I was finally taken " .	-5.3728
As an uncharted , this Bavarian world is still open for the new , the match was seen .	-8.0360
Rudy , for example , did not have one or two in the catacombs , but determined six or seven interviews .	-3.6390
Kimmusch passed after a few rather tender statements on the back of his new co-player .	-6.8166
There he heard of swle an interesting phrase : " What is going on here , I already noticed .	-5.3417

The West Riding Trier is also playing a role in the plans of the country , which is at the forefront of the Federal Road Safety Plan .	-7.0318
The objective is to start the course in December 2020 , says ministerial tribunals in Cornelia Holtmann .	-4.7434
NATO sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competitive companies .	-2.8449
The Chamber of Commerce ( IK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , seeks to impose a Rhine Pfalz label on wine in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been made for ten years .	-7.2898
Furthermore , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , praises the IHEK .	-4.3891
In the new Master-Bonus , the CraftsChamber of Trier provides an additional incentive for young trainees , says Matthias Schwalbach , Managing Director .	-6.0243
A € 1000 award for the winning master exam and € 2500 when graduates make themselves independent in ten years after the master training .	-7.3550
But the domestic cost list for the country remains long .	-3.2420
The planned construction of the road was quick to create facts , while at the same time it lacked the necessary staff , says Jan Gloauer , the chief executive of the IHK Trier .	-6.3796
Of 56 new engineers wanting to stop Wissing at home mobility , only 29 posts have been filled .	-4.6220
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .	-2.9649
Christian Baldauf ’ s CDU Group is referring to the Court of Auditors ' calculations that the country is investing more than EUR 20 million in 2017 and 2018 than proposed in obtaining national roads .	-5.6147

Audi is expected to change 85,000 diesel cars - car manufacturers face a backlash .	-3.6351
A day before the announcement of Audi said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 35,000 vehicles .	-3.1590
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options as restrictions on driving , ' and thus referred to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based , to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-7.7569
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions .	-3.1438
None of the companies described their undertakings as a callback .	-3.2466
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.9057
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma .	-2.2840
The cost of car manufacturers to install installations designed to neutralise the refunding exhaust emissions from diesel vehicles is also high , which makes it difficult to keep the car price competitive .	-7.5804
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignoring the mighty car companies that are in distress and of indicating the problem .	-4.5703
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen ’ s mistakes , which have been the use of so-called off-the-shelf equipment that could regulate emissions to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but are returning to normal driving conditions .	-7.5093
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.2303

Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , having accused the Audi authorities of having installed a system to deal with emissions regulations in Europe , and expanded a question focused on the United States .	-4.7804
The inclusion of Audi into the research could be a heavy burden on Volkswagen : the car manufacturer Luxury contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-4.5514

" The happiest day in my life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-2.1838
At the end of the 1960s , he achieved a breakthrough in Lima , New York and Paris : by publishing his television in " Paris Match " and then in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-6.4461
Even in China , murder has attracted many fans .	-2.8393
Time and again the artist got inspired by cities .	-3.4246
Large , sweeping murder figures shudder in drawings with the leaning tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.1336
In the early morning , he himself is still in the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-5.2395
His figures continue to spread widely around the world over calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , T-shirts , plinth animals and watches .	-7.3379

Lavender from Provence is threatened by climate change .	-3.4149
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .	-2.2996
The lavender is diminishing because of the conditions of drought and because of the diseases of insects , causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.5527
Eric Chaisse , expert on agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " Lavender in Provence is in real danger , because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has caused much less rain in the spring and much more in autumn .	-5.9786
This has effects on the lifetime of lavender .	-2.5743
There is also a small cinkade , a microbacterium that transfers the diaphragm , and there are many of them in very dry weather . '	-7.6381
And there is a lot at stake .	-2.0511
Lavender oil is not only beckon for holidaymakers , it is also very important for perfumes and cosmetics .	-6.3932
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having a long plant ear with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under-developed , or either missing or weakened .	-4.0426
So we have less parts of Ethiopian oil . '	-2.7805
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and a slowing down of depravity from the ground , but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-6.1921

A journalist ’ s assassination highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-1.8671
The Riodoce weekly workers usually meet to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sindaloa through organised crime , corrupt officials , and ceaseless drug wars .	-4.9411
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.4901
They were told that it is important to change their routing .	-2.7601
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer : they are going to take their children to the office , which in 2009 was the objective of an attack with grenades or leave them at home .	-5.3962
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.0114
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and bell-emotions .	-3.9863
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businesspeople , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s pay list or the cartels , a catalogue of criminals making the mess of Mexico dangerous .	-3.8638
There is no relaxation break from violence , and while the corpses are accumulating throughout the country , more journalists have become involved : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto began office in December 2012 , 589 are after attacks and threats from the state , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-7.5595
Among the latter , their editor and their inspiration for Riodoce , the founder Javier Valez Cardenas .	-3.6772
" The biggest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , " he wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .	-5.5128
His absence is deeply felt despite his presence everywhere - a large photo of Valez , which shows his middle finger with the word " ace " , hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-11.1864
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their alpine dreams , insomnia , paranoia .	-3.5877
Although a special bar was established in 2010 to process the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , only two criminal proceedings were initiated .	-5.4311
As with most thousands of murder related to drug trafficking and organised crime each year , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.7836
In Riodoce , they are still insisting on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa , although they are volatile and although the terrain is still more treacherous .	-5.7238
Without information about the perpetrators , without justice , the meeting on security issues has little use , says Iarra .	-3.8983
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.2260
" Until we know the Why , we mistrust all . "	-4.3635
On the morning of May 15 , Valez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital city of Culiai .	-5.0385
He was forced to drive a few blocks far before his roter Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men .	-6.5290
Schütze went away in his car and damaged it near .	-3.7050
Bill was 50 years old .	-3.2401
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.1990
Rumours tend to lie freely in Culiasis .	-4.0432
But , on the subject of Valez , there is virtually nothing but silence .	-4.4495
Since Guzmans ’ arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa became one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.5044
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot in the streets , or that the graveyard is full of decorated , double-story dumplings for drug kings , which are larger than many homes for the living .	-7.7909
Forget for one minute that there is a state of peace if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug routes to the United States .	-4.8924
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and Director of Riodoce , is at fault that he could not protect his friend .	-4.6844
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.8662
First of all , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of a rival cartel group in war with Guzman Sven .	-5.0145
This publication may have angered the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosk .	-4.1337
The second mistake was not to force Valez not to leave the country to his own security after taking up another newspaper that had published the same history .	-5.5793
Valez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-5.2468
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .	-1.8958
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold USD 50 .	-4.9011
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to do journalism without breaking up with the drugs problem " said Bojorquez .	-5.2710
Over time , the newspaper had a reputation for courageous , honest reporting , and sales and advertising .	-4.3324
Reporters loved it to publish hard-standing investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.7090
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Award " for reporting in Latin America .	-3.6207
In the same year , Valez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-4.3489
He gave him free to fear .	-3.7236
" I want to live " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.1065
drug-trafficking in Sinaloa is a lifestyle , " he said last October in an interview with Rompido TV .	-3.7082
" You must take over the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you are playing the dummy .	-4.9563
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many Toter ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.6098
The Riodoce team missed Valez , the Spasvogel , which could flood like a port worker , the friend who was generous with detours and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-6.6784
You were familiar with his routine .	-2.3940
He would always have his hat .	-1.5764
It would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and there would always be the same table .	-3.5753
Now they ask : Was his love for routine his loss ?	-2.7449
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best while staying alive .	-4.0691
" They may not care if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways and landing streets " to get drugs .	-6.4385
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-1.5425
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-1.8318
Get your own instincts trust .	-3.0492
If it is wrong , stay away .	-4.0141
The anger , said by the publisher of Riodoce Andres Villarroeal , is that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter is with Javier . "	-4.5341
The old rules as he and others say are no longer valid in Sinaloa , just as they are in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home .	-4.3581
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.2806
In the space where riodoce staff met for security training , no mobile phone was suddenly allowed .	-5.7153
On the inside two police tried to protect against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-4.9300
They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a Mid-class area of Culican .	-4.5738
Half in Scherz , some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 % of the police that the governor himself called untrusted .	-4.2255
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountains , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.4951
For this week 's edition , Ribace has looked after three main stories .	-5.6852
There was the assassination of the former Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.6282
They also had an eyecatcher to government spending focused on the city of the governor .	-5.6813
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiaci , one block from the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-6.0111
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so be careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite place for drug dealers and authorities .	-4.7238
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is a member of the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled almost all political levels throughout the century .	-5.6530
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of corruption for high-profile cases .	-2.6168
Villarroeal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-4.2817
Only a few months before , readers would have considered the column of Valez as the best informed source of kidnapping .	-5.3561
" In the past we had known what happened " , said Villarroeal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flamo " because of its slim body shape .	-3.8883
" Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . "	-1.5354
The office of Valez was transformed into a space for characters and labels that protest against the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something they would never expect : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.6998
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist at the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-3.4841
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valez was killed , in western Michoacan .	-3.4773
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his .	-3.3188
Throughout the country , journalists have become more vocal in writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on walkways and buildings .	-3.8561
On that day , the director , Bojorquez , is away from Washington , and is trying to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Valez .	-5.9546
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valez , Ramirez accused the authorities of harping up journalists and killing them because they said the truth .	-4.8968
Since then , it has been asking that it be re-classified by the government , because it is concerned that its anger has undermined its objectivity .	-5.0686
He said repeatedly that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials , and an equal society .	-4.6030
In his last book " Narco-journalism " he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also by orders from politicians and security forces that were covered by organised crime .	-4.9246
Last year , the media body " Articulo 19 " attributed more than half of the attacks on police and officials .	-3.9848
" In Mexico you walk , because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-3.0533
Apparently , the killings have a deterrent effect .	-1.7205
Nobody forgets the death of the blogger , Maria Macias , in the northern border of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-4.0897
Your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas-cartel : " I am here for my reports " .	-4.3008
A computer keyboard and headphones were positioned next to their separated head .	-3.6848
Some stores have chosen to close the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.4020
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-3.0715
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez public directed the drugs cartel with a guide item on the front page with the title " What do you want from us ? "	-6.5189
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .	-2.0600
It is a painful decision .	-0.6913
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.9362
And sometimes they are driven , as it appears to be the photographer Rubens Espinosa , who in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-4.4187
For those who stay behind and continue working , it is a daily dance with risky choices .	-3.5744
Ibrahim , who once wanted to be the poet , admits that drug trafficking kills him .	-3.0325
" Mexico is going to hell , so I was reporters , " he said .	-3.2402
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the sidewalk before the office and tranks beer when all their phones started to crowd .	-6.4803
A number of gunworks with gang arms and security forces close to the town of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-4.3589
The war continued to escalate , as a number of anti-trust threats in the region promised .	-3.7961
You have published the news on the website of Riodoce from the stem of the drone .	-6.7958
The title page had to be changed on the next day .	-1.6226
Sirene hecked close to - another shoop in the area .	-5.8671
Bojorquez raised a glance at the police who kept a watch to see if they were ready .	-3.6044
If they were even afraid , they did not show it .	-4.0115
In the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sindaloa , the workers of Riodoce followed his footsteps .	-4.8971
" As you can only remember " , Bojorquez said , " if the same day Mr Javier was murdered , the internalists asked me to send them to the street for reporting . "	-5.7358
dinosaurs used camouflage to escape its enemies .	-3.8471
At first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terrifying one .	-2.0766
Researchers now found that the first insights of a Canadian mountain worker ’ s sanatorium were so well received that experts described it as a " Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-6.7583
It was so good that they could even discover that his scaly skin was by redeeming brown - and they said that she had some " disquiet past " .	-6.1803
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " describes him as " the best preserved dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world " .	-4.3381
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodossaur , living in the middle of the formation between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-4.7171
His incredibly rich state of affairs has stunned researchers who describe it as ' really remarkable ' .	-4.2360
According to reports in National Geographic , the flowering plant Fresser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-4.9054
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-4.5916
He struck on something that seemed to be misplaced by the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .	-5.2178
The paleontology discovered by him was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology .	-4.8186
They spent the next six years investigating the wild animal within the pound ( 1.100 kg ) severe earth klines .	-5.0158
After all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .	-2.3933
" If you just blink a little of your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept " , " said the main phrase Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrell Museum , where the creature is seen .	-6.5823
" It will be entering the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur . "	-4.4624
Researchers found that even though he is covered with a armor and resembles a shifting tank , he was probably threatened by flesh grazing dinosaur .	-6.5536
The well-swept dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-burial , which is also used by many modern animals .	-6.3224
This would have allowed itself to feel better in its surroundings and to escape its enemies , tell experts , which suggests that it was threatened by major dinosaurs .	-6.3472
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodossaur family made headlines in May for the first time and is now seen in the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology .	-5.7762
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markchellli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of the team who spent more than 7,000 hours of doing it carefully .	-5.9761
Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists were able to document the pattern and shape of schemes and armor on his body .	-3.5706
They discovered the condescents , a common defense method in the animal rich , which means that the tip of the creature was darker than its base .	-3.8045
Although condoms are common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds those of today 's living animals .	-3.8886
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from flesh freedom-dinosaur , that evolution benefited the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.9943
But most contemporary animals using condoms - think of deer , zebras , or asparagus - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this noossaur was exposed to a real battle for survival .	-6.1467
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive , heavily packed dinosaur showing how dangerous the dinosaurs have been to be prey to civilization , " said Brown .	-7.8471
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaurs was rotated .	-2.2140
Scientists continue to examine the animal to evidence of his life , including its conservative intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .	-4.4650
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was transported to the sea , where he fell on the back to the seabed .	-4.0439
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South flora today , and rivers and oceans are likely to spread much further than they are today .	-3.5958
" This Nodossauer is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conservative scaly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original shape of the animal , " said Brown .	-5.3897
" The result is that the animal today looks almost like in the early making .	-2.9639
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is in the sleep . "	-10.2577
It was a time when Earth walked through the earth as a gigantic oceanic , carnivorous dinosaur .	-8.2314
Although the king of them , the tyrant , Revo , lived millions of years into Borealopelta , the packed dinosaur was driven by some of his fearsome ancestors .	-5.9580
These include the Accanhosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy monsters .	-3.7999
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was buried after death in the sea and in the mud mumified .	-5.5419
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort Mcray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.7480
According to the museum , it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the bargain to the hips .	-4.2477
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-4.5192
It consisted of two 20-inch long tops , ranging from his shoulders .	-5.0466
The researchers believe that the regent plant Fresser was swayed by the Western Canada until a flooded river it flooded into the open sea .	-6.5398
But the naval burial of the dinosaurs kept its armor in an exquisite detail .	-3.7545
The fossilised remains of this particular example are so well preserved that skin remains still fudged tanks along the dinosaur .	-5.1010
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in Lotto .	-2.8816
The more I see it , the more confused it becomes .	-2.6969
The skin remains intact still cover tiresome tank plates which carry the skull of the animal .	-7.0929
His right wing is on his side , his five fingers are excited upwards .	-2.8136
I can count the scales on its sole ' .	-2.6268
In a thunderstorm : mass carambolage on A8 : Many injured .	-3.7969
A heavy accident on Thursday night on the A8 : Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambage .	-4.3885
There are a lot of injured , miles of long traffic jams and caverns .	-5.0022
On the Stuttgart-München motorway ( A8 ) at the late Thursday afternoon , about 20 people were injured at a mass caramboulage .	-4.7929
According to the first indications of the police , at 5 p.m. between the train station Adelzheim and Odelzhen ( district Aicha-Friedberg ) , there were almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks .	-9.6853
First of all , there was no data on the precise number of casualties .	-5.1942
It is easy to medium heavy injuries , said a police spokesperson .	-4.3264
A large array of rescue vehicles was at the point of the accident .	-3.2440
The A8 was completely closed to Munich .	-1.4616
In Munich , there was a population of about 10 km .	-5.8132
As a AZ reporter reported , there were also massive obstacles on the backtrack - through numerous Gaffer .	-5.7993
The fire brigade notes the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who are now facing sensitive penalties .	-5.6143
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Davos .	-4.4542
A collision between a car carrier and a passenger was in place .	-5.4036
A helicopter was on the way to the emergency .	-4.4317
Deutsche Bahn : Group is testing " Comfort Check-In "	-2.2690
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing is waiting in the train and sleeping .	-4.6055
Or one is deeper into his work and has just one ingenious idea .	-3.4902
And then : puff .	-1.3671
Become a member of the creative team and get a soft or exciting glimpse of the car in the middle of the workflow .	-8.1595
Map control .	-2.3778
But periods of disruptions will soon be over .	-2.6827
The Deutsche Bahn is testing the single ticket controls .	-4.4628
You can confirm by phone that you take your seat and then save the ticket .	-5.7240
Currently a testing operation runs on two tracks .	-3.3540
" If you have any questions , please do not hesitate to contact us .	-4.9644
It will probably be available on many other routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a railway specialist .	-5.0277
" Comfort check-in " means that the train will call the ticket evaluation without Schaffhausen .	-4.7230
In order to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.4884
And you have to book an online ticket , which is what most passengers do anyway .	-4.7908
You also have to go to the DB Navigator App which is the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-5.9652
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-3.3491
For the " comfort check in " works like : get on the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-5.3433
A button for electronic devaluation will appear for test customers .	-3.5167
On their mobile devices , the drivers get an indication that passenger X is in the train and has taken the seated seat Y .	-6.1036
When the train ticket controls are placed in place Y he knows that there is a passenger with an already covered online ticket .	-6.6371
You can sleep again , continue work , not to mention .	-4.3678
Check in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn will benefit passengers .	-5.0788
" If you want to travel comfortably without ticket controls through our train staff , check in the DB Navigator .	-4.7167
This allows passengers to make their journey time personalised in the train , " says Michael Peterson , marketing board of DB long-distance transport .	-4.8136
The second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-4.2761
Those who often train , know that , apart from delays and passing trains , the ticket checks are one of the greatest problems .	-6.2986
Because often you have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to calculate online tickets .	-6.0147
Either the credit card or ID card or any other document you have to provide .	-3.7933
The result is endless discussions between train drivers and passengers , which leads to poor mood in the lower body or metropolitan area and delays in the control of their own tickets , and the Schaffner takes the time to deal with other concerns .	-7.9308
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.6371
And this is only true on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stult , and ICE 912 Stuttgart food .	-5.5062
Other train numbers on the same route are not available yet .	-2.6062
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Why Streets ? "	-2.3634
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.5402
Just one day after she arrived in New York City , the people of St. Louis Geburse sat on the bed of an air bnb apartment that she rented and scroll through Facebook on her phone .	-6.0992
She proud of a post by someone from High School .	-3.8830
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street " , it was there .	-3.8361
Confused because no one else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.9292
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly interviewed on their timeline .	-3.3022
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killed live in death by Michael Brown , an unarmed young age , killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-5.9387
He postulated an image of unregulated body , which was executed on the street and would remain four hours there .	-4.8865
" That is wild , " he thought Ferrell was among himself .	-4.6787
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.5051
She launched her mobile phone to return to Tweets on the Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-5.3031
There were photos of the police band and people writing , and of a man who claimed to be browsing father who carried a shield with the record : " Ferguson police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-3.8975
They observed a live feed , with a police dog standing in front of a group of demonstrators .	-3.8403
In a different video , she said , one other police broke his gun and wrote : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-5.6929
" That is not normal " , Ferrell was reminded of her .	-3.9336
" This is not the kind of murder we used to call ourselves and which we can typically call . "	-5.0790
In this moment I felt like a shaker .	-3.4883
I was angry and crying . '	-1.5485
They booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-3.3405
After landing at 23 o 'clock , she took her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-4.9716
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Why Streets ? " , in the cinemas from 11 .	-4.0499
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exist from the point of view of the people who live in the Community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.3381
As a Ferrell with her daughter , who carried a flower dress and a matching crown , went to Ferguson , the two expressed a conversation , which she had , many times before this morning , » about the black experience and the black state « .	-7.9898
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they think ? " she remembered what she said .	-6.2465
" We are now going on to Ferguson , because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not the right thing . and are .	-5.0497
I could not take them on " , said Ferrell later .	-2.9667
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.6593
It must know it and it must be seen and raised in it .	-4.0918
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to get free to get rid of ourselves .	-4.2932
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she does not experience blatant racism , she is not different from the next black women ’ s release .	-5.8464
I feel I would make her a bad service to keep them away . '	-3.8605
The first station when she arrived in Ferguson was located on South Florida Road , a place in front of the police authority , which became a camp when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson .	-8.1824
That was where Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-4.6223
They prepared bags and helped them pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.2844
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrari began to take shape .	-2.9298
" My activism has changed completely after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of St-Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.8800
" I had no experience organizing .	-1.2605
We have all got it . '	-3.5966
weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration , Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.4728
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-4.3446
One question came from Ferrell in the sense : " Do you wish to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? "	-7.8939
This skepticism has been nurtured by countless cases of people , often by whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-4.3651
As Folayan recently explained in an interview : ' We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centralize their voices and we wanted to make it different ' .	-4.3044
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism on death street inmates .	-4.1005
His commitment to Ferrell brought the project closer , together with six other locals followed the team of " Why Streets ? " in the years after browsing .	-4.3155
" This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us , " said Davis .	-2.9841
" That was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because that is how I will be displayed . "	-5.0275
The goal was not to focus on Ferrari 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messiat leader , but a community that comes together " , said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participating in the film .	-5.1544
As a result , papers from " Why Streets ? " show astonishingly personal aspects of Ferrari 's life , which is in love with her and marry her wife .	-5.9325
" I felt like naked " , said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.1876
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the degradation of black people . "	-4.1418
In addition , Ferrells ’ history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Livs-Matter movement .	-2.8846
Two of the three founders of the movement who , following the killing of the black teenager Tracy Martin in 2012 , identified the movie " BlacklisMatter " in social media , is a gay one .	-5.3775
" Black , gay women in management positions supported the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-4.0016
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.5148
Folayan agreed to notice that " the movement is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-3.0046
However , it insists that ' this is not an affective type of action ' , when the Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to its identity .	-6.2935
" She was the person who sacked this energy , " she said .	-2.7720
" It is not a coincidence , although she was at the front , because in a life at these crossings as a black , gay woman is at stake .	-5.3290
You can feel their energy through the screen . "	-2.6137
In the meantime , the news cameras have long since disappeared in Ferguson , but the racist links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-4.2481
Ferrell is in conformity with tried for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-4.3528
She describes the cultural atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-3.4089
However , she sat on a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she was in Ferguson three years ago .	-5.6098
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9852
It is our duty to win .	-0.9437
We must love and support each other .	-1.0507
We have nothing to lose except our chains . '	-1.7591
From " Dream " to " economies of scale " : TV readers discuss bit-gallery .	-3.6378
The Bitcoin gallery moves people even though it has not been built for a long time .	-3.9673
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian precinct since the first presentation in 2009 reflected the population in supporters and opponents .	-6.1293
Cold doesn ’ t make the issue much easier .	-5.2028
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.9070
While the one said about the bit-gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " This would be true class " ( Nicole Scharsten ) , comes from the other side : " custom no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply " economies of scale ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.5730
While supporters rely on a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be flooded .	-6.2196
In addition , the gallery will be planned precisely on the site where the peasant market hall stands , where 13 direct marketing companies offer their products .	-5.3993
It will end with the beginning of the construction process .	-7.5824
The gallery designers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside .	-5.2969
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying almost weekly in the peasant market area for many years .	-4.0448
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes from the farm women always very happy .	-3.6176
We discovered the butchery for ourselves .	-2.2298
We would like to see that , even during and above all after the construction of the gallery , there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .	-4.8393
In other cities , there are others .	-3.1195
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-2.8639
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery is placed at the height of the rent .	-4.6517
It is probably not very low in the new project . '	-4.7535
Eva Kilic : " Wozu Purchasing palpieces in Bitburg ?	-3.0166
Whether it is clothing , shoes , drug culture or supermarkets , I find it superfluous .	-4.0063
There is enough of that in our city .	-2.7453
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-4.0529
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we have at least the market hall .	-3.8517
After all , the products offered there are fresh , mostly provided directly by the producer and are also inexpensive .	-5.3843
As you can see , shopping in a shopping center is only carried out by larger companies , because the rental prices there are often not acceptable to a retail company .	-6.9421
Too bad , there is almost no longer any specialist deal and what remains of it will disappear . '	-7.0720
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping mall with a market hall doesn 't match me .	-1.9331
And the gallery does not fit in with Bitburg .	-1.9548
Above all : Where should the peasant market hall go up during the construction time ?	-5.6391
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the bit-gallery really comes at some point .	-3.3409
Or is the ghostly Bit-Gallery formerly creating all its operations from Bitburg ? "	-6.9404
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-2.1612
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.6023
In my view , it would have been better to promote a proper agricultural market , rather than this gallery .	-4.4441
But for a peasant market hall there is no longer a place , thanks to the bizarre many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-5.6622
If the farmers ' market hall is mugged , a little culture will disappear again . '	-5.2045
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea DNA .	-1.8420
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost invisible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-5.8614
The 30 portraits were created by the artist , Heuer Dewey-Hagborg , from Waffen-Tugs and haircuts , who were sent to her by Chelsea Mannering .	-6.2163
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where former intelligence analyst married a 35-year sentence , having released them as confidential diplomatic messages on the site WikiLeaks .	-5.8974
The new exhibition , opened on 2 August , is called A Becoming Resemblanche ( a corresponding similarity ) .	-4.9410
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline incorporated its expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a transwife , and groundbreaking opposition , whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .	-6.5912
Dewey-Hagborg has created a strong , though some intellectual comment not only on the availability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the hardening minim of these interpretations - but also for identity .	-8.5077
Manning , who was born as Bradley Edward , but has already talked openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the law on spying , computer fraud and theft .	-4.9049
Through the prison her picture was suppressed , so much so that there was only one photo - a greasy , black and white Selfie , where man 's obviously sits on a driver 's seat and a plain pervert - with which she was associated .	-7.5309
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012-project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.4257
In this , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette smoke and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look .	-4.9769
That was the time when she received an e-mail from a newspaper magazine .	-2.2715
" She gave an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.5582
And it could not be visited at that time and it could not be photographed , so you had contact with Chelsea and asked them whether they wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-9.5215
The artist and her imprisoned muse were sent to unequal briefbeings who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-4.7789
They even created a comic " Supplressed Images " by Shoili Kanunga , which foresaw a future in which President Chelseas ’ s judgment would be converted , and it would be able to view the exhibition personally .	-5.3994
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Mannings released after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-4.2965
There is also something low and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against whistleblowers from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new ways of getting rid of the rigid divisions he should actually fix .	-7.7675
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-3.4613
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called with her overwhelming signature ( the " i " in her family name is with a heart ) an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which gender , race , sexuality and culture have been . "	-5.5902
On the opposite wall , their mitochondrial DNA sequences - a thousand-meter of Cs and gions and as well as a lead .	-6.5939
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including 200 letters ( or nukleotide after the artist ’ s advanced scientific Lexicon ) how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.4419
" What people will hopefully take from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are " , said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , track memories , is also to be seen .	-4.3452
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . "	-2.8796
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the above comic novel .	-4.1932
It shows how it appears with a call from the disciplinary powers of the United States such as King-Kong .	-4.6673
" If they cut your speech cold , they have won , " it means .	-5.5257
" So never stop the mouth " .	-1.8165
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me " , said the artist coming from Philadelphia .	-3.3685
" I 'm still getting a bit more look around when I talk about it " .	-4.6100
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it has been taken forward in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by their own genocic simulates , which , like Horden , are confounded .	-7.9927
This was also targeted , as in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Stattre ) , where their genetic luck groups were written with a pencil .	-6.7233
" In the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of portraits .	-2.7018
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement composed of Chelsea , as the movement that was behind their liberation . "	-4.5662
Professor of the University of Northwestern People and an employee at Oxford University search for death .	-4.8973
A nationwide hunting is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and a member of the University of Oxford , who are sought as suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .	-5.6905
On Monday , for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duraneleau , as shown by the acts of the District Court of Cook County .	-4.1851
The documents say that Cornish Duranellau , 26 , after several spots , died .	-3.8027
A Community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the bodies were discovered on 27 July .	-4.4684
Officials received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments , and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-3.1132
Cornish Duraneleau was declared dead on the site of events , and detective investigations the spot as murder , while the police actively sought the two suspects , said officials .	-5.0763
Since 2007 , Lathem is a professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University .	-3.9263
Alan K. Cubbage , the vice-president of university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem was now considered and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-5.4823
" This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation , " said Cutbage .	-4.6710

A spokesman for the University and Somerville College said in an email declaration that ' we are in contact with the British police and are ready to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible ' .	-3.9347
He added that Warrens colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up .	-3.8053
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Guglimi , said he strongly urging the suspects to stand up to the authorities .	-3.9936
" The police have an idea of their location , and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves " , said Guglimi .	-4.3420
Guglimi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-2.0117
Guglimi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a noble tip , who said that something had happened in apartment 1008 .	-4.5893
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.8146
Guglimi said that it was unclear whether the incident had also taken place on 27 July .	-3.3550
Security cameras confirm that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.8444
" We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglimi .	-1.7476
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic event . "	-5.0256
" We will complete the WADA timetable in the near future " - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muttko .	-3.8908
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Muttko said that it will not take a long time to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.9563
" At a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK anti-doping ) .	-3.6818
The WADA travel plan has been updated in this regard , " said Mugko on Thursday .	-3.7404
The PM commented the second part of the WADA roadmap to observe the code which describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization 's website .	-4.2334
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could cause concern to Russia .	-3.1656
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-1.9831
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.4693
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren for alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-6.8173
As for the matter , Mutko said : " We are conducting the investigation , because our anti-doping system got a mistake .	-5.1853
All the measures have been taken .	-2.9212
But there were no state programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-2.9187
Mutkos ’ s words were in line with those of Vital Smirnova , the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-3.6508
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnova had problems in the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules .	-4.5534
Nobody imagined accepting this report unconditionally , " Smirnov added .	-4.4077
In November 2015 , RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia .	-4.0759
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.3322
After visiting the main district of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA-Director-General Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA moves in the right direction " to be used again .	-5.1496

Ampy Enthust wanted to measure happiness with your staff at your e-Commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-5.9244
Answers were often vague , unhelpful , or , worse still , fraudulent .	-3.0414
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-2.4572
" There was no consistency and objectivity " , said Ertt , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .	-3.8166
She has called people from outside for help .	-2.0012
A new breed of human resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-2.6390
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , offer special groups and demographic groups , to raise anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases whispers allow the C-suite managers to circumvent and turn directly to the board .	-15.1704
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the fitness for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start Glit , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees .	-4.0415
Worry said she got a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glit in the three years .	-4.8411
In addition to the snapshots and surveys by certain teams , it offers a hot card from the company that shows at a glance what units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill up why .	-6.6999
Companies understand that at the top of the workplace culture must remain in order not to become the next lawyer involved in scandals , since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-6.2450
For start ups like Glit , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.2581
The global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could hold more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Financial Web site Let 's Talk Payments .	-4.3535

Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-2.4002
It has recently been registered as a client .	-3.3964
As Glit , Convercent allows companies to send tailored " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-6.0975
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.2026
And when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.3383
" The court of public opinion captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quintan , the founder and director of Convercent .	-4.1357
If a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves ethically , it may experience expensive consequences from consumer magazines , worker surprise , and complaints , Quinplan said .	-10.1185
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has deployed Conversion for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their business center .	-5.8855
Previously , when a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the business centre , submit a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .	-3.9390
It was often a intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow complaints from employees .	-3.6269
Now that the company is committed to converging , problems that were previously hidden by executives sitting in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment , or unjust practice .	-7.0872
" I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of employment , " said Vitrano , who runs the risk management group in Ruby Tuesday .	-4.2716
" And we protect our shareholders from competitive disputes . "	-3.4704
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employees ’ commitment more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting scheme Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-5.5471
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty linen online .	-3.2111
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people use hope as a strategy , " he said .	-2.5253
Both Glyint and Convercent offer your software as a service , and companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-4.6407
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors , both startups supported .	-3.4006
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-4.4269
Glitzers secured $ 10 million in November from Better emerge Venture Partners , bringing all funding to $ 60 million .	-4.5033
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.7536
There is a growing research complex that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done .	-4.5887
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only intervention .	-2.3296
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.2616
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefit and Employal at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.9284
Investors win returns when their portfolio companies run well , when employees are committed and committed .	-4.4414
If the Analycs tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment to employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.7961
The data about employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .	-3.5961
But the data is useless if a company 's administrator does not take action .	-3.0862
In fact , when a company asks for your feedback , it can be expected that change is on the way .	-3.7340
And if change is not fast enough , or at all , it can breed disappointments and discourage employees .	-3.5428
" If you are asking for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too much on data collection .	-6.2554
" Because if you do not follow people will ask themselves , " Is ye really heard me ?	-3.7466
Do you think so ?	-3.4644
And who you do not care about why I should ? '	-3.4560
Madison Reed , who has now conducted monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about gly , caused .	-5.4284
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees , it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , able to reorganize several teams within the company and to add a communication train to address the problems .	-5.2682
At Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better integration of employees in an industry that is well known for high sales .	-6.6501
" If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.2492

NCAA eliminates the two daily practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-1.8590
It 's on 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA bootball players talk on one side of the new training areas of the team at the Campus .	-6.6941
Some have picked up their slab parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-5.1857
For a good part of the team these unforgettable minutes are a lunch break .	-2.9632
Players who have been enrolled in the summer classes will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. .	-5.2061
" That 's a true " for the guys over the next three days " , brother Jim Mora said shortly before the Monday to Tuesday .	-5.8591
NCAA eliminated two daily exercises to ease the load of the players , and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.3973
Therefore , the first three courses of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already completed time plans of the player .	-4.4668
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the camp ’ s beginning almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Moras ’ s six live hours in Westwood .	-5.2343
In the course of August , they will hold 18 exercises , 20 before the start of formal exercises for their Begagainst Texas A & M in September .	-6.4434
Mora said he would support the rule change of NCAA , even if they add a further point to the player ’ s more experienced routes .	-5.0661
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.5024
" And they just got through , they pluck up , they are great people .	-4.2120
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-4.2647
The UCLA will terminate its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task in view of the clear lines of its fields from an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskinn Center , a high class hotel that has already been promoted with footballs , which have a protective network behind a goalposts .	-9.1230
The hotel is supposed to occupy this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-5.3796
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.2718
" This is a real problem , and it is not very far to think that people rent a room there and then adjust to record an exercise .	-5.1533
If you have the video tape from an exercise , it 's a good deal .	-3.1065
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces in the parking area 8 .	-4.2979
We will do the best to deal with what we have .	-1.9057

We have a plan . '	-0.8940
Facebook wants to step up Tatsache scrutiny in the fight against fake news .	-3.8501
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake news from third parties and show their findings under the original contribution , said the world ’ s biggest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to combat ‘ fake news ’ .	-5.5047
In an opinion on its website , the company said that it will begin the use of updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to factual checkers that may show results from the original article .	-6.7135
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .	-4.1251
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French electorate being inundated with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to eliminate haze posts as they did before the September elections .	-5.9902
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that a test of the new fake-check will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.3058
" In addition to the knowledge which stories of patent examiners are challenged third parties , people want more context to make informed choices about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-5.2323
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .	-5.0596
Create a comic novel : A castle in the history of England .	-3.2534
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squash musical video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970- and 1980s .	-4.8618
But Scotland has experienced 700 years of tumultuous history from its cosy location in the River Valley in Kent , and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes , a moped Yorkseman with a preference for historical documents .	-6.8144
" I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years " , he says good-bye .	-4.0126
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand " .	-2.1841
From the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families that lived in Scotland .	-4.7696
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : He wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotionally .	-6.6622
" I only reacted to the pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700-he worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.5932
" That 's his thumb !	-2.6397
And letters always cry for smoke , because at that time a fire was opened because of the light .	-5.5357
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were .	-3.5804
Oh , I love archives ! "	-0.9963
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued " ) , this seems all too nice to be true .	-5.7949
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , seeing the archives through and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the quarried Hyene heads at the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-7.0091
He travels through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and talks with nature investors , gardeners and sometimes with the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-4.6444
Then , at night trank " Whisky and started to write " .	-4.0706
The intimate story of Scotland is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Husey , died .	-4.0729
When Rhodes met a decade later , the workers began to care about the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , put it on the roof . "	-5.1212
diaries , letters from the time of English Empire , maps that represent who had what : " You could think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-5.3097
Lads , let 's go his way ! "	-3.7591
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into the English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the peasant Hill of 1381 .	-5.3893
" There is a record of an uprising that took place in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Familie of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-5.3788
" The peasant revolt started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.6872
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-1.9521
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit Father who the Darrell family spent seven years in the English translation hidden .	-5.8260
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the smugglers Arthur Dartrell was presented from the 18th century , who performed his own burial by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was digging ) .	-7.2889
The darrells are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : " To be the men seemed to be Gauner , repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-5.9307
Other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crises by raising wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to raise birth . "	-5.8334
After finishing his degree in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.6314
He has spent two weeks in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about elkäki , the site of a sanatorium dating back to the early 20th century which has been from nature .	-6.4357
But Scotland has a special place for him .	-1.3443
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-1.3315

Since the failed coup , head of state , Erdogan , has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirers .	-1.6824
More than 10,000 troops were removed from the ranks of the army , mostly because of a congenial connection to the movement of the exiled Fehullah Gülen , which saw Erdogan as the masterminds of the coup campaign .	-7.5333
This week , 486 people who should have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been negotiating in Ankara .	-4.8329
Even on the day after the coup , Erdogan called the crash attempt as a " gift of God , " because he gave him the opportunity to " clean up the armed forces " .	-4.8739
But has Erdogan got the army under control ?	-1.7520
At the end of February , the newspaper " hurriyet " published an article with the title " unease in the military headquarters " .	-5.0047
On the general level , there are concerns about an increasing ' Islamisation ' of the army , which , among other things , manifest themselves in the lifting of the headscarf ban for solo candidates , the newspaper wrote .	-5.4278
In any case , the army and the security forces will go on .	-4.3522
In mid-July , by decree , Erdogan sacked other 7395 public servants , including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers .	-4.0571
Yet it seemed that Erdogan tame the military .	-2.4900
The generals used to be the actual masters of the country .	-3.2435
Three times , they sat on their role as guardians of the secular order of state .	-4.6708
Following its victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the military 's power step by step , not least on the European Union 's reform objectives .	-5.5387
Former officers say that Erdogan is intentionally setting up an Islamicisation of the armed forces .	-3.1538
In the Vocal Europe magazine , a nominated non-representative officer who was looking for asylum after the coup campaign for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be " full of extremists and centrists " in a few years ' time .	-6.3470
If that is the case , such a development could not make NATO cold .	-5.2376
There is no doubt in the alliance after the cleansing that the Turkish army is ready to work .	-4.4421

The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned .	-1.9167
Just when you thought that 2017 cannot become even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector is coming .	-4.5242
Yes , in fact .	-1.2111

According to Noel Sharkey , emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and cofounder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.0559
Customers can select the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of finger nails .	-3.8762
" People are mocked about them , but the companies supply a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-6.0332
Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners into robots with an silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human responses achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.3907
The user can also customize his / her robots according to his / her conviction " and select everything from the moment color of the robot to the shape of the chest halves to the type or color of its fingernails .	-6.2691
But it will be even more disturbing , as many robots have the ' personalities ' that would make a StepFord woman look progressive .	-4.8629
Modern sex puppets have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.6317
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robot to the characteristics they find appealing , such as stowing .	-4.5871
And then there is the Roxxy Gold sex-robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrau " , which gives the impression of weariness and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous personality " .	-9.5561
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible " , he revives the website of True Companion .	-5.0934
She like what you like , and she doesn ’ t like what you don ’ t like , etc .	-2.9832
Over the course of the day she also has her moods - quite like real people !	-4.3285
She can be tired , fixed on conversation , or she can be " in mood " ! " are . and are , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.1610
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underfunded female characteristics , the allusions to rape when one step is taken to Frigid ( that is to say , repulsing ) Farrah , worry one of the most .	-8.0542
On his website True Companion Roxxxy added a vibrator , but for men .	-4.3132
" If women ( sic ) can have a brainer , why can men not have any Roxxxy ? " is it on the website .	-5.3433
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys .	-2.3358
Their emergence and growing sophistication point to something of darkest and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-4.7746
Of course , most men will not keep sex robots , and while the FRR takes on its increasing popularity , they are still temporarily on the margins of consumer culture .	-5.7075
But what breaks out from the marginal areas can be very instructive for the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.6950
And many people are not strange or offensive until they allow the free market to do so .	-2.4914
There is a certain overlap that this highly developed sex robot comes at a time when women ’ s rights are threatened worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who has been excited to have sexually attacked women .	-7.4523
The most disturbing aspect of the television series ' The Handmapid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphic images , the blurred body and the tinged eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.0350
The Republic of Gilad is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .	-3.7631
The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical resemblance to real women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with pornography proportions ) .	-4.1815
Their builders want to feel human that they emulate the movement of a real body .	-2.3745
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots do not represent real women .	-3.1932
They cannot be separated or simply removed .	-4.0874
They do not have any mediation or background history , nothing that suggests to independence or anything that may disrupt the imagination of totalitarian subjugation .	-4.4320
In other words , they are a fake slave .	-2.3687
Or to put it to the handyman of 2017 : housemaid .	-6.2194
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.2039
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of the healthy sense of human beings .	-4.8661
It has become a delusion of the Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have split families in small format as well .	-3.4135
Around Christmas and Harvest , there were newspapers in the US about how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s favorite relatives .	-3.5245
We are all supposed to be tough on getting our filter bubbles burst .	-3.7456
Trump ’ s power to bring families together has been less notice .	-2.9628
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet , who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family , has visited me in New York this week .	-3.6140
It reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .	-2.2619
With Trump in the White House , everyone who knows her , including the Republican kin , with whom she fought for decades of politics , is suddenly on the same side .	-4.6368
To the dining table , that is certainly a good thing , but it seems to me , in a further context , that this also considerable .	-5.8703
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but its presidency has the power to put us all on the right .	-3.9185
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we are referring to the gruesome possibility that one day ’ s bibles will no longer blow us away .	-5.4456
But there is an even more appalling long-term scenario in which Trump ’ s Republican of the right “ normalizes ” that , once compared to its standards , suddenly seem to be an embodiment of commonality .	-7.3968
I find myself today of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s comic version of the recalcitrant - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement was ) , which in fact happens to be a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-7.4063
If Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be mentally healthy to qualify for immeasurable improvement .	-3.8848
When my coffee was in the city , we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park , the largest of New York ’ s Carousel ’ s parking department , and the best three dollars to be spent in the city if you do not need a caffeine .	-6.1762
The horses are huge , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knifey and the animals are rolling around to look out with fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the brilliant music conveys this in a strange way .	-6.7400
So many clichés of a city do not disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the Skylines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .	-6.6198
Fifty years later , and I am still not over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a big round-about in North London .	-5.2295
But the Central Park Scorpion is still a magical experience , since it has two two-year , 11 year-old and two women in the 40-year period .	-7.9308
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given it the full amount , but , fortunately , nobody asked for it .	-4.8652
On the other hand , I was forced this week in a department store to evaluate my experience with transactions on a scale of up to five stars before I was able to transfer my credit card .	-4.5121
In the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to lower the rating with a 15 % tip - this is to buy something about the retail table .	-5.0495
This does not only slow down what should be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring people into a situation where they are not required .	-6.8046
The poor woman in the department store was stunned , while I 'm tired of my 5 star credit card .	-5.5365
Oscar Pistorius , with breast pain , moves from prison to hospital .	-3.2635
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.5459
Last year , he was brought to hospital for cutting on his hand joints , which he suffered from the prison authorities in a case in his cell .	-5.2347
Pistorius was sentenced against a first death sentence for murder by prosecutors .	-3.3071
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine 's Day in 2013 by opening it several times through a door of the Toastbooth in his house in Pretoria .	-5.1065
Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night intruder who hid in the cabin .	-4.1661
prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-month prison sentence of Pistorius , from which they say it is too lenient .	-4.7203
The National Law Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .	-2.8557
Pistorius risks increasing his penalty for 15 years when prosecutors are successful .	-3.0152
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-1.1121

In the future , three women are attending school , four at the Realschule .	-6.8209
At the same time , the head of school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Haus Bisental in Ephfenhofen .	-7.1569
As a symbol of school leaving , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder , elected a young eagle who grows up in the chicken yard , but then released into the freedom .	-6.9750
The " Der Adler in the Hennerhof " was introduced to accompany the international jazz musicians .	-8.2118
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , eating away from his chickens .	-4.0858
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out of the .	-3.3143
But the hope to make him a chicken , the eagle spread its wings on a high mountain , and decided on it .	-6.4636
After that , the classes showed three and four a chicken dance in the fiction of Yvonne Frank .	-4.3318
The Hens danced with the young pauces who wore the cylinder to bet .	-6.2859
The Adler stands for integration , said head teacher Angelika Sitte .	-3.2553

I would like to thank my fellow Members , former head of school Michael Müller , who has repeatedly raised the issue of education , and the parent .	-8.4387
The Kükenzeit is over , explained the teacher of the school , Sophia Schumpeter .	-6.9726
After two years of teaching , she leaves her students very reluctantly , because it was a really great time .	-5.2513
Finally , they were able to rely on the Viertünssner .	-4.9330
At the end of the course , all the students made a song of summer and holiday time .	-5.2891
The children were delighted with this .	-4.0327

Two Bulgarians have been arrested for illegal camping in Greece .	-2.1555
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece , and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television , told .	-3.9462
In the morning of 1 August , a group of illegal immigrants was arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-4.6735
On the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .	-2.9926
The Foreign Office reported bTV that the Bulgarian people were released later .	-2.1647
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on the free Camps and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to be in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-5.8548
The controls continue throughout the season .	-3.0088
The ministry said that the court could impose a fine .	-1.7228
Software update for diesel vehicles : What those affected need to know now .	-3.2981
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.4672
Do diesel vehicles have to participate in the action ?	-2.8177
See the main questions and answers .	-3.5329
At the same summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the BMW Group offered software updates for a total of 5.2 million cars .	-3.4676
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in categories Euro 5 and in part EUR 6 .	-4.2816
Euro 4 diesel or worse off are excluded .	-2.5537
Anja Smetania of the ACE Auto Club Europe provides assessment :	-3.7633
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.2286
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.1395
" The obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have playback software " , says Anja Smetania .	-5.3100
Their equivalent was the headmaster ( KBA ) .	-4.5702
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.3841
The manufacturers have announced that they will be implemented quickly over the next few months , but they have not yet specified a precise date .	-4.6716
Daimler has announced that he should contact any party concerned .	-4.7582
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-3.1458
How long will the overall retrofits work ?	-3.2305
" Heavy to say " , says Smetania .	-2.8313
This is a matter of manufacturers ' commitment and of political pressure .	-3.5513
" Because we have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment so far . "	-4.0631
How long will the update last ?	-1.3171
The rearmament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.4887
It is time to get an appointment .	-3.4483
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the BMW Group ?	-2.4894
The ACE is a matter of waiting .	-4.2374
It is likely that foreign manufacturers would withdraw from this , so Smetania .	-6.1578
Now , is the threat of a massive price fall for Euro 4 cars ?	-4.0448
The ACE feared that .	-1.8284
But it is precisely in the regions where there is a threat to a ban on travel .	-4.6552
In rural areas , there have so far been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.0796
The ACE advises to wait for sales .	-3.6357
L Cool J receives Kennedy Center award .	-2.7620
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-2.7429
The first prize under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.3074
One of the winners does not want to come out of protest .	-4.7780
L cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to be one of the sought-after awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-4.7434
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) , and the producer of TV Norman Lean ( 95 ) , are among the artists .	-5.4297
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December .	-2.6307
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump is hosting a welcome , joining with his wife , Melia .	-3.3464
The winner , who is known as progressive TV series , has already announced that they will not participate in the gala .	-5.8383
He said , ' The New York Times ' : ' This presidency decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to remove the funds - and this is a burden on me ' .	-6.2242
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-4.2951
The Kennedy centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural facility in the US capital .	-3.8576
The former winners include Meryl Streep , Arequien Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks , and Sting .	-4.6799

Roland Waicker , Haslach Stadtbauster , will pension next year .	-4.6785
The place is already out - but suitable candidates are thin .	-4.4817
For 31 years , Wacker Stadtbauster has been a winner .	-5.8783
And the work still gives him great fun in the press discussion .	-4.4506
He reports various tasks , but also demanding , waiting for his successor .	-3.7528
At the same time , he is surprised that no application has yet been fulfilling the requirements profile .	-5.6387
The city is looking for an architect or architectural engineer at the next possible time .	-4.2697
In this way , there is still enough time to be built up , taking into account the regular termination deadlines .	-6.3874
As Haslach acts as a subbody for the administrative community , the applicant must provide relevant degrees .	-6.2030
For this function certainly wants to keep the city .	-3.7431
If they can no longer fill them , citizens would have to go to the meeting till the fair .	-6.4888
But the city ’ s proximity and its own importance , says Wacker , who reports about a good operating climate and good mood between the authorities and citizens .	-6.5710
In more than 30 years in office , a number of important projects have accumulated , which Wacker proudly looks back on .	-5.2766
" We make the city worth living " , it is safe through the building office and its staff .	-6.0611
In the future , various projects will also be on the agenda : the renovation of the former Hukla-Areals and the Niederhofenpark park park , for example , have been initiated .	-6.8337
The Kinzig-Bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , even the Stadionanization is still subject .	-3.8605
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million in book ' if we do ' .	-4.2395
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-1.8895
The work here is fun . '	-1.3948
The design is there for a large freedom of movement for the town .	-5.2115
Haslakh ’ s own building courtyard and market town can respond to a lot of flexibility .	-6.3582
" You can do a lot " , so Waicker , and the design of the green facilities is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.6046
Since the old town is an ensemble of heritage protection , it is important to have " an eye on what fits " when new buildings are approved , " the outgoing town builder emphasizes .	-6.9680
The town hall has a strong responsibility to ensure that are not allowed .	-6.8272
He is owner of the building , " at the end everything goes on my table " .	-4.8116
With care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( low-construction ) for 15 years .	-7.0667
He also hopes that his successor will be a long one : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with him " .	-6.4837
Because continuity is important not only for a good operating climate but also for the further design of the city .	-3.7633
Roland Wacker wishes to have a degree of degree as a diplomat or a bachelor ’ s degree in design and construction law .	-7.6350
The Municipal Building Office operates high- and low construction , building management , general employment , management of the city properties , Municipal Office with Bauhof and Municipal Guard , as well as the property rights authority including Monument protection .	-11.7185
Bicycles on wires thrown : southern railway block .	-4.9140
According to the police , the perpetrators so far had thrown the blue bicycle from the train train route in the direction of the Lederer Strasse ( B116 ) to the lines .	-6.6485
They were so badly damaged that the subsequent train had to be stopped .	-4.0359
Investigators run out of two male criminals and have been looking for them since the night .	-4.7859
Near the village there were witnesses of a rose-scooter and a bicycle truck .	-5.3369
" This goes far beyond a fork " , " said ÖBB-Prcher Christoph Posch to the APA .	-5.2745
The perpetrators themselves would have been seriously at risk and also threatened with rail transport .	-6.7966
In addition to the damage to the station and the facility , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail transport , the rail users could also access access the perpetrators .	-11.8357
On the whole , the speaker said that a ' substantial ' amount would be to be expected .	-5.6132
The damage was remedied again on Friday afternoon , rail transport on the southern railway line could be carried out without disabilities .	-6.6583
Nearly ten passenger trains were on Friday morning , two of them related to distance transport .	-3.6790
The goods did not fall , but they were delayed .	-4.0815
According to ÖBB-Prcher Christoph Posch , around 200 meters of senior lines had to be replaced .	-3.8886
Injectors and masts were also damaged .	-3.0616
Rotes meat , dairy products and chocolate may help to relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-1.9131
Rotes meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.8134
But a new study claims the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products may ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-3.6308
The ominous state in the US about 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach attacks , recurrent or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-5.5652
While those affected usually get rid of meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant colon .	-5.7365
The leading researchers , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immunodeficides in the intestinal filter to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not enter the body .	-5.5481
cells capable of triggering inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-3.4717
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may lead to inflammatory intestinal disease .	-3.3242
In experiments it was found that a type of tolerance promotes immune cell is found in mice carrying a certain bacteria in their relatives .	-5.9267
And the bacterium requires Trypotophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.6580
Professor Colonna said : " We have a link between a bacteriorinart - lactosbacillus directives - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbioms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-5.4724
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-2.5322
He suggested that the combination of L. Crosteri and a nutrition tolerant to Tryyptophan , less inflammatory intestinal strains , if the same system also affects people .	-7.9463
The post-Doktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Baragan evaluated a kind of immuncell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study sufferers had such cells , but another group of the same tribal , but which was separate , did not .	-7.0571
They believed that the difference had to do with the micromolecules of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi normally living in the gastrointestinal tract .	-3.8067
The mice were rotated with DNA and there were six bacteriological narts available in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing from the mice .	-7.3125
mice were spread in a sterile environment , leaving them a microscope-biom and not developed this type of immune cells , and they received the L. cortex and the immune cells .	-6.8989
In order to understand how the bacteria worked out on the immune system , the researchers allowed L. to grow in a liquid and then transfer small quantities of the fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-5.1274
The immune cells have become a tolerance cell .	-3.1240
When the active component was cleaned from the fluid , it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan-metbolism known as Indo-3 lactic acid .	-4.7604
When researchers doubled the amount of Trypotophan in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but if the pump values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-6.3303
Dr Cervess-Benagan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us will protect L. standards in our gastrointestinal tract .	-5.3392
It is not known whether Tryptophan-by-products from L. terireu develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in gene related to Tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal infections .	-5.7288
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , because these cells control inflammatory substances on the internal surface of the intestinal .	-3.9449
Potentially , high droppoint values in the present of L. terium can lead to an extension of this population . ' are . are , , , , , and , , , , , , ,	-7.5888
Jose Mousrinho believes that Manchester United has a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.1191
At Manchester United , with Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mousrinho believes , after the middle player on Wednesday had his debut against Sambassia .	-3.8446
Chelsea ’ s 40 million signature began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the Super A Cup against Real Madrid begins Tuesday , and appeared in the holding role as people like Paul Poggiba and Andreas Pereira pretended .	-7.2286
Matic , however , was excluded from the blues 's preparatory Asia tour and managed only 45 minutes , which was what Mourinho attended , that he had to improve before the Premier Leguet season began .	-7.6535
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mousrinho .	-1.9198
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.5278
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukoku started in the city of Avilva-taion , when Mouringho was shaping his start for the season .	-7.2167
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho still had three new obligations , but he insisted that the club had already done a fantastic job to fulfil three of its four priority commitments .	-5.1975
" Three of four to receive , thank the club " he added .	-4.4107
" I will be happier if they receive four of four of four of them for me , but they have given a great deal of effort . "	-4.8618
Boeing " Dreamliner in the Sky	-3.5709
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-2.3041
The pilots flew from Seattle to Washington , but the drawing began in Marquard in US State Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliners across the US , which are several thousand kilometres .	-7.0587
The action took 18 hours and one minute .	-2.3803
The shape of the Dreamliners was on the radar monitors .	-4.2178
This was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.1607
Boeing had previously made such advertising .	-1.7958
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing-logo was painted in the sky .	-5.1306
New rock-bottom for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem .	-2.9575
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still the leader of the SPD , socialist prime ministers were always looking to Berlin with some concern .	-4.9832
None of the team 's opponents were afraid of a central party , just no - the were the of .	-8.8240
Since Martin Schulz has led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-3.2746
Since then , employees from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been monitoring events in the national capitals of Germany , with growing horror .	-5.7986
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described as headwinds .	-4.3621
It was low precipitations .	-3.2260

The Federal CDU , after the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-3.9873
" This once again shows : Rot-Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber , the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.5333
The Surprising Group as a member of the Greens / European Free Alliance has put Prime Minister Stephan Weil 's government into a grave crisis .	-10.1591
Five months before the country election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority in opposition from the CDU and the German Free Democratic Party .	-3.5043
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kelner has asked the breakaway Lower Saxony MEP Elke Tweste to return her mandate .	-6.7580
The entry to the CDU is a clear falsification of the will to vote .	-4.5689
Elke Twsten must give back their mandate immediately , " said the German Federal Managing Director and the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-6.2883
" Surely this must not be true " , a SPD competitor would argue that the new Hinaunt reached the party central on Friday morning .	-8.7227
Stephan Weil , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the entry of the green MEP Elke Tweste to the CDU without his own majority of government .	-6.4296
It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in the national associations .	-3.0631
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.4698
The Misere began with the unexpectedly significant defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-1.9783
A blue eye , more not , the comrades calmed down at the time .	-3.0075
After the rural elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-3.1970
It was then - and it was all significantly worse .	-4.2593
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln , the Düsseldorf-plethide valley the party smooth .	-6.6293
In the weeks after that , the cooperative has been brained .	-7.0834
Then , when they had just launched new bolds , the Hamburg G20 Summit came .	-4.1524
And with him came the next low .	-2.5021
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong leader of the SPD , lost his niche in the weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-5.8053
And because , after that , in crisis communication , he made quite a mistake about what can be done wrong .	-5.0649
Since then , Scholz has struggled for his political survival .	-2.0924
So now , Mrs Weil .	-2.2807
Due to the fact that the VW emissions subsidiary and its role in the Supervisory Board , the subsidiary prime minister has been under criticism for some time already .	-6.7463
Mise poll numbers were added .	-3.3661
Yet , or perhaps this is precisely why , in recent weeks , Weil has been trying to make ever-greater demands on the Bund.	-7.0314
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not lost in the vicinity of Martin Schulz .	-4.2452
They gave it , because they promised that the party would be stabilised by Weil .	-5.4953
Now the exact opposite may be happening .	-2.8510
Because basically no fault is found on the island-internal dispute of the Lower Green region .	-6.2516
And Schulz has not done so .	-3.3094
For now , the cooperative is endeavouring to keep its own ranks closed .	-3.3702
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and especially at the apostasy parliamentarians in the latter .	-5.8195
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twsten puts her own career interests over the interests of all the others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party 's left in the Socialist Group , Germany 's editorial network ( RND ) .	-6.5312
Mrs Twsten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but on the list of Lower Saxony 's members , so the of are still .	-11.3323
The logical consequence would be that they give back their mandate .	-2.9656
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD federal parliament , laments a " undemocratic manoeuvre . "	-6.8536
" The electorate was clear four years ago : the people made Stephan Weil to the Prime Minister , " Oppermann , who led the Lower German SPD to the federal election of the RND .	-7.4310
" Now the personal career concept of a future CDU member is falsifying the result , " Oppermann said .	-5.9303
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.0838
I want to know whether there has been more or more promises from the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-3.3619
Funds for Local Authorities III	-3.2719
Those who want to restore their homes in the years can soon get their support from the country .	-5.0860
The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG City Development informed on Wednesday in Interesse .	-4.6672
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a review of what happened .	-6.9385
Since 1991 , it has been divided into areas of sensation .	-5.8816
At that time , in the recovery zone I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Wurttemberg has taken over two-thirds of the total subsidy .	-5.2509
In the 2005 / 2016 rehabilitation area , the grant was still 60 % .	-4.3017
In the case of Schindler , the previous restorations are a " success project " - it is important , after all , to promote internal development and not only to open up new areas .	-7.0584
On April 4 , the government Presidency of Karlsruhe received information that there will be a sanctioning area III .	-4.1582
The total subsidy amounts to 833 333 euros , of which EUR 500 000 come from the country , the rest of the community felt .	-4.4482
What is the origin of a rehabilitation area ?	-3.8515
You will , so Schindler , investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.5110
It also has a role to play , however , whether in the planned area there is any interest in redressing it .	-10.2438
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be moved again .	-4.2904
The STEG represented on Mitwotz Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gothic .	-3.2239
Keller presented the content of the Bund language program " Social City " in which the restorations would be carried out .	-4.2006
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of cities of the interior , the improvement of living and working relations and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-5.1136
The measures would be designed , i.e. per plot .	-3.6100
The area of redevelopment would then be laid down as a statute .	-3.3626
The allocation period for the funds has been going until April 30 , 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-4.5318
However , until September this year , the inventory would be carried out once and for all by filling in a questionnaire in the rehabilitation area .	-6.7308
In November or December the decision is to be taken as far as possible in order to begin the preparatory work next year .	-6.4795
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality should carry out the said prior investigation .	-3.8320
It is a question of assessing and deciding when recovery is made and the extent to which the urban construction is performed .	-5.9795
It will also enter a confirmation entry in the basic book for the respective property .	-4.6671
Pietzschmann himself will come to feel again and make an image of the situation she promised .	-3.7551
Goths emphasized that the project was a key success factor in the participation of the .	-5.2051
That is why we will have questionnaires that will be sent to our citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.7118
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land sheet " , which includes , among other things , the construction state and the restoration intent .	-4.5731
In the grey questionnaire , the " fiscal and housing sheet " , information on the size , division and residents of a living room can be made .	-4.0130
The blue " operating sheet " can only be played out if the building operates in the premises .	-7.0460
However , it is worth noting that Goths pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .	-5.0243
Moreover , new building measures are not eligible .	-2.4773
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds will work in accordance with the principle of ' greyhound ' - who comes first , please first .	-7.1550
You cannot reserve the support money for later on .	-5.8548
Finally , photos of the project " placemark II " have been shown to make the presence of " milked " .	-7.3061
British inventor uses a microchip to get into home and car with a hand movement .	-2.9965
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.5536
Steven Northam , 33 , had the tiny chip implanted between thumb and pointing finger , and now offers services for companies and individuals who want to ease their life with technology from BioTeq .	-6.0724
Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory administration agent at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , has joined him to ensure that the implant is performed according to medical standards .	-4.7603
The technology resembles a cat and dog maturing microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-3.3048
The company of Northam also wants to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-6.6548
The unmarried father of one has now integrated both at home and with his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is in the tax .	-5.8092
The White House ’ s Advertising Suppliers cost the taxpayer thousands	-6.0035
The White House ’ s decision to fly a maritime helicopter to the South <unk>n for an event that America ’ s manufacturing last month highlights taxpayers , according to military data left to the TIME magazine , costs up to $ 24,000 .	-6.0248
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.9627
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-3.3288
The helicopter produced in Connecticut was presented in addition to a maine Yacht , a fire-fightercar from Wisconsin and a fork from Mississippi .	-6.3989
The White House ’ s military office required the presence of helicopter in a fragmented order or GRIO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the record of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX 1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-5.9641
" I just wanted you to be aware of this , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility " , the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event his predecessor , the vice-naval commander for aviation .	-4.8684
The news revealed that the helicopter arrived on the South Lawn in the morning on 17 July , and until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-6.4343
The note adds that if the departure was to be delayed from the White House , a second team would be required for the return flight because of restrictions on the service hours .	-5.0375
The original crew was in the helicopter during the event , while the safety staff of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-4.2799
The records provided by the TIME did not show clearly whether a second crew was required .	-5.2763
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using government property for political purposes .	-2.4048
Data sets show that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-3.7826
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-3.6640
" Klingt , as if you are closed , " replied to the person in question .	-4.8275
The event " Made in America " was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-5.3793
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.0152
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb government rules .	-5.4655
The use of the aircraft , known as Marine One or Air Force One , is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes .	-2.5333
Presidents are required to use them for their journey .	-2.2055
But asking for their use only for a photo surgery is unusual .	-4.1620
In February , Trump conducted an investigation when the presidential aircraft , in the light of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account , is full of news about the use of his predecessor .	-6.3491
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made in America " - products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.9609
HMX 1 crews frequently carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn , to replace US presidents with precise cm in the White House .	-5.6945
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in July , HMX-1 led 58 training lands in the White House .	-3.6108
The flight for the ' Made in America ' event included the training needs of the crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-4.6353
Helicopter units additionally flew 11 hours a day for " non-Presidency support missions " .	-2.9755
The White House said that tax payers did not accept the burden for any of the other acquisitions presented at the event .	-3.5980
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in laying the helicopter out in South Lawn .	-4.2755
HMX-1 does not have budget recordings for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.3264
However , according to an hourly tariff on the US Defense Department for the financial year 2017 , the Dow D reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is 24380 USD per hour .	-5.4745
Records of the unit are the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Air Facility in quantico in Virginia .	-4.8842
The White House argues that the actual cost of aircraft operations is far below this rate .	-2.5804
" The cost to taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for refunds is highly misleading " , said Walters .	-4.1817
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds . "	-3.7443
According to a 2015 RAND study , the recruitment rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and contract .	-5.0854
At that time , the former White House spokesperson for the White House , Sean Spicer , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .	-3.3362
" The idea is to present this week things produced in America , " said Spicer .	-2.7979
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , are dependent on it .	-3.6606
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.5984
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.0442
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he took his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he set himself in the driver seat of a fire brigade car .	-5.1172
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media about his own fleet of company products .	-3.5103
" I know Sikorsky very good " , the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.3987
TC BW Neuss before tricky task	-2.1360
The second tennis league leader will lead the table in the third search engine SV .	-5.7748
The TC Blaw-Weiss Neuss will enter the table third search centre in Kiel tomorrow from 11 a.m.	-5.0375
Despite the remaining five rounds , the top runner of the Second Tennis Coach League still has a sense of reality .	-6.3187
Team chef Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-3.8336
" This is a compact team that always plays in a rather similar formation .	-2.8149
Especially at the back positions I find the team very good . '	-2.8537
In particular , the imports from the high North provide class and stability for the searchengine SV .	-4.4988
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup .	-2.9771
And they are also strong in double " , says Zay with a view on Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olsen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Shateus ( all Denmark ) .	-4.7709
" This is as always difficult for us .	-2.8514
There you also need a good portion of luck . "	-2.9712

How America Can Defeat the OMV	-1.8772
Donald Trump was really lucky when he folded up his signature of the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-4.8380
" In his haste to legislate , " Congress inserted a few " unconstitutional rules " , he certifies .	-4.5676
The reaction from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of taking the US .	-4.4051
After all , the proposal is to punish European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines in the EU .	-9.5173
Meanwhile , investors of the domestic OMV , who together with other European firms , have been co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic pipeline Nord Stream 2 .	-5.1165
The drone strikes are daunting .	-1.8854
However , it is too early to predict the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil company .	-3.6170
In fact , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions back to life by using Executive Order .	-5.0759
Twelve weapons are at his disposal .	-2.5988

Narcos season 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel is brought to the fore in the series of Netflix .	-3.6085
Despite Narcos 's second season , which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-3.8134
The relay three and four have already been confirmed by the Streaming Service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest Bon movies of the show .	-5.2027
In the third season , the DEA focused its attention on the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali Online .	-4.7804
Led by four powerful godfathers , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government brides and violent actions .	-4.2179

Role backwards : The city introduces 46 kitchen aids .	-4.1891
The city arranges the Kita lunch table again .	-4.5964
A permanent commitment to the children and a team .	-5.3274
The clock is turned back in the townhall .	-3.0976
On September 1 , the city of Krefeld will take over the Essen branch in the town 's child-daycare centres ( Kitas ) again in its own .	-6.6324
For Sonja Pommeranz , deputy head in the field of youth aid , this is a good news : " We 've all been very pleased . "	-4.7908
It is still a pleasure to drink outside the house : A caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh herbs chilled .	-8.0007
The city runs in the area of 46 children 's daycare centres , and in 44 children are given a warm meal for lunch .	-5.7593
Over the past Kitayacup times , 2800 children have been at the tables , and the need is growing steadily .	-7.1111
" Meanwhile , not only children under the age of 45 are eating in the kitchenette " , explains Pommeranz .	-5.2942
" The offer also applies in the 35-hour care if children stay until 14 o 'clock . "	-4.8815
46 part-time workers will have kitchen services from 1 September : they will warme the food delivered , complement them around salad , raw material and fruit , prepare the meals individually , prepare the food , wash away , and clean the kitchen .	-8.9735
" The employees are assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-4.2956
The size - there are two groups as well as seven seven groups - determines the amount of hour .	-3.7821
" The kitchen workers now belong to the Kita team " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.2645
" In this way they are much more involved and it is easier to apply pedagogical concepts .	-4.8108
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking classes .	-3.8729
" The children should help prepare the meal " .	-2.5259
The direct connection to the team of kitchen power makes sense .	-3.1363
For children too .	-1.6671
" You have a known force in the Kita , a person who is familiar with them and not always change people " .	-3.3905
This continuity is important for children .	-1.4359
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff .	-4.1486
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen services - has also proved to be the most economical in terms of improving the quality of the kitchen performance , as well as the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of cost comparison between the government and the outsize of the city .	-9.2706
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being recruited again .	-3.9559
" But these hours do not matter as much as 750 people in the field of education " , says Sonja Pommeranz .	-5.2989
Afghan democracy depends on women 's political role , the UN says .	-2.2173
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , the leader of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday .	-2.1166
Nicholas Hayom , President-in-Office of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will be in the provinces in the Council elections , and three women are standing for the role of Vice-President and more than 30 % of the newly registered voters are women .	-5.2316
" The role of women cannot be overestimated " , he said in a statement on Wednesday .	-2.1714
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and are included in all parts of the electoral process .	-3.9196
Afghanistan ’ s elections to the provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.6138
The Taliban have issued threats to an electoral process that are associated with the transition from international combat to an advisory role .	-4.7116
This year , the elections will , for the first time , hand over power peacefully by a democratically elected government .	-3.8518
Hayome said that a strong role for women will enhance Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-2.9964
The Afghan independent election commission reports that 1.2 million women in total are registered in 3.6 million voters .	-2.7505

Men try to crush 13-year-old girls	-2.4771
Two young men aged 19 and 23 years will have tried on Thursday to take away a 13-year-old girl .	-3.5495
According to police information , the men spoke to the 13-year-old people who sat with friends at the Kolpinchstraße against 14.55 , because they wanted to talk to the girl 's mobile .	-7.4406
The 13-year-old refused to accept the request and went on with her friends .	-3.1270
In response , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the cell phone and the girl ’ s halte , which was maliciously .	-7.5657
Without prey the duo survived .	-4.4791
The two young men were arrested later by the police .	-1.6581
The investigations are ongoing .	-1.9988
GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie-factory in Glasgow	-3.3913
A trade union wants to assure executives of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .	-7.7318
GMB Scotland said that the company had a discount on the future of investments at the rabies plant .	-4.4035
More than 500 employees work in the plant , producing besides other products from Hobart and Rich Tea Kekse . are and are . are , , , , , , , , ,	-6.5201
McVities 's owner , Pladis , has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-3.6792
He added that workers and trade union representatives would be " experienced first " if their activities were to change .	-3.6485
In a letter to the dock at the company 's branch , GMB Scotland McVitie asked ' to express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines is not being promoted ' .	-5.7024
GMB-Senior-Organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain any clarity from the general managers about the business needs and investment plans for the future of rabies is a matter for our members .	-5.5401
Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce is heavily concentrated on the local community and the region of Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .	-4.7825
Therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , the rising cost of living and the chronic fall in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie .	-5.3872
A speaker from Pladis said : " The Filialleger at Tolcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , as we appreciate the constant commitment of employees and trade unionists .	-6.5500
Two months ago , we had regular meetings with staff and GMB representatives at Tolcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-3.2802
We discussed with the staff that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , we are constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our business divisions and locations - to remain competitive .	-5.3427
She added : " In recent years we invested more than 5 million pounds in our rabies plant , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-4.0975
We are fully aware of the legacy of Tolross as a production .	-5.0724
Did the PSG Barcelona warned three years ago against the Nemar ?	-2.9491
The site of La League may wish to welcome you to Marco Verratti .	-3.1731
Paris Saint-Germain will not cease in its persecution by the Nemar , having issued an offer of <unk> 189 million in order to launch its freedom clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years ago of the world record ?	-9.6072
The sensational approach has spurred the transfer window in summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than double the previous brand , while Paul Poggiba returned to Manchester United for <unk> 89 million last season .	-4.8393
After the end , Nemar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paid professional portal .	-5.6195
Barcelona is angry about the way in which the Nemar has forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan state insists that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-6.4359
But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President before that prospect ?	-3.4519
When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.5551
" I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said al-Khelaifi .	-3.1096
" We respect all clubs .	-1.0598
But if they try to sign one of our players , they will have consequences . "	-3.2099
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association expressed interest in the PSG core player Marco Conditti at the beginning of this summer .	-4.4441
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers to the General .	-6.1685

In the town around Stolzenau he faced a car in his driveway , so he had to go out to the right .	-5.3402
The tour operator thus touted the circuit circuit .	-4.4312
Material damage was caused by cars .	-3.3481
The driver of the upcoming car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of traffic accidents .	-4.1001
According to the accident , it may well be that the user did not notice the accident .	-4.7363
The police are now asking for evidence and the drivers of the vehicle 's ' polluter pays ' to be in contact with the Commission in Stolzenau , 05761 / 98. and are .	-6.0161

Christian Weissener , spokesman for the reform movement " We are Church " , said after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects the former Regensburg bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig , as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerging Pope Benedict XVI .	-6.9914
It would greatly serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own branches or their mistaken interpretation of the events at that time .	-5.3337
The Vatican newspaper , on the other hand , criticized " Osservatore Romano " that , when it comes to reporting violence against the Cathedral , two sets of standards are measured .	-8.6910
As regards the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubt that it is a ' shameful and humiliating act ' that would have to be punished and prevented in the future ; but striking is the ' degree of media ' manipulation , such as Author Luceta Scarankia , Historiker and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee .	-8.2416
" The habit of referring to the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , " Scaranea writes .	-5.4631
The Fürstenin Gloria of Thurgau and taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk : " You can go without the church and that is a hot meal " .	-7.7108
In addition , she pointed out that in her youth " would have been a very normal educational means " to finish with children , as I was one .	-9.3322
It would be unfair to apply the standards for earlier decades , because the world has changed .	-3.2977
In connection with the reports about bad things , Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-4.5552
Completely wrong , says author and historian Michael Hesemantic who wrote the memory band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated in 12 languages ) with Ratzinger .	-4.7611
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemantic , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-3.9004
What exactly is stated in the 440-page report submitted by the Bistrot around Regensburg with the lawyer Ulrich Weber ?	-4.7622
In total 547 Regensburg domains were sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990 's " with high availability " victims of attacks , 67 Domspam .	-7.0402
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , says : " In short , it is true that in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been used by Domkapelle R.	-5.5026
Particularly in high emotionality , punishment for pupils could be even more severe in this respect .	-4.1968
Nevertheless , unlike many other accusations , many victims value the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even positive memories are combined with him .	-6.3583
In the interview , Heseman explains why the final report on the abuse scandal for the financial institutions of the Regensburg , says Georg Ratzinger , in his opinion , eases the burden on the of . and are , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.0510
Mr Heseman , the 440-page report on " incidents of violence to protect stolen persons in the Regensburg " gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-5.9692
For one , many students highlight their " humanity " .	-3.1312
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholera and perfectionist who became the jealous hand when a secondary musical had no top performance .	-8.0328
How do you , as a Biography , assess this final report ?	-4.0363
Michael Hesemantic : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger actually exists .	-6.6962
He is dedicated to eight pages and is clearly acquitted of any suspicion of complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.3260
The excessive violence at the pre-school also came beyond its scope .	-3.4918
At best , it is possible to accuse him of being too late or of not taking the first notice seriously enough .	-7.1812
The Cathedral study at which he worked was found by virtually all the respondents as " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-7.6444
For example , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , gave him an excellent testimony , described him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , competent " and " understanding " , as a highly benign teacher who regularly provided the guys with cakes , cookies and bons and " always transformed grapes from children .	-7.0937
Only a minority complain about his comrador his high emotionality , which also caused a stir .	-6.7557
He himself acknowledged himself years ago , deeply regrets and apologized for the fact that he was not , but also , and , , and . and were . , , , , and and . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.5490
But he must be told that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , in the 1960s and 1970s , among parents , as in teachers .	-5.8921
Are you still aware of this breeding method ?	-2.9485
Of course , I am thinking of everyone born before 1968 .	-2.6883
I have also seen this in a secular school , a state high school .	-3.1362
However , compared with what is actually happening in this report , namely the horrendous sexual abuse and the excessive violence at the pre-school , these are , of course , petty .	-5.8303
One wonders whether it has more to do with his celebrity and role than brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just descended upon him .	-6.6463
After all , many people who have never understood him are still working diligently .	-4.0222
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-2.4101
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse in the airports of Regensburg .	-5.5105
Will Georg Ratzinger also bear some involvement in the final report or co-knowledge on sexual abuse ?	-4.3701
Michael Heseman : absolutely no .	-2.9241
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the Chief Kapellmeister .	-2.5574
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-2.0582
" I never married to my father or my mother , " said a bitch on behalf of the others , " I was very embarrassing " .	-7.7828
The real problem with the awareness of sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent .	-5.1544
If they did not even know their parents and siblings , then certainly not a Choral leader , who would have been , to a certain extent , a colleague of the perpetrator .	-7.5559
How do the postering-party assess the role of Ratzingers in terms of malpractice ?	-7.2189
Michael Hesemantic : A student put it in such a way : " For sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had timely knowledge and could have lived the perpetrators .	-6.1264
I think it is also really absurd to assume that he has just opened up ... a more urgent or more clearly or even more clearly than with her parents , internal-leaders , confidence teachers etc .	-12.3634
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . "	-2.4740
So the report comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that the students and / or their surroundings were entrusted to him in the run-up to the event could not be confirmed ' .	-8.3240
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free to talk about everyone involved .	-3.2137
He could not be accused of not being prevented or being prosecuted .	-4.0974
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these heinous crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.9460
In the media , there was much to read about " excessive violence " in the Regensburg .	-5.2022
The former Chief Kapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of " Looking the way " in the report .	-4.6183
Will he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.3426
Michael Heseman : This is the big problem , that everything has been mixed up and turned into a huge Melange of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-7.2274
But that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .	-2.6650
The fact is that it is going to separate them : between the pre-school and the School of Cathedral , between sexual abuse and excessive violence , and , let us say , other accusations .	-7.6620
In addition , the report deals with incidents of the period since 1945 , including four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the Cathedral .	-4.3876
All the appalling teaching of minors , the incidents in which the dead of Sahrawi teachers were systematically harassed and malnourished , and they suffered horrific ones , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhen and Pielenhofen , where really scandalous conditions need to be ruled .	-9.7860
But with them , Domkapelle Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with , for he got the boys face only when they were already on the Domspam School .	-6.6696
On the one hand , as most of the witnesses emphasise , was the subject of " Pre-School " tabu .	-4.9046
They were only lucky to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even " paradies " states .	-4.3907
What was different from the postgraduate study ?	-3.7753
Michael Hesemantic : there was discipline , but not even sadistic violence .	-4.9031
And this is also true for Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims value the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories are combined with it ' .	-5.7298
At most , there is still a charge of walking away .	-5.1172
However , despite all the efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the conditions at the pre-school .	-5.0410
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself , and from the facts at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) he wanted to hear nothing , and then back in 1993 .	-7.3310
Did Georg Ratzinger stop his ears in front of the stands ?	-5.5474
Michael Hesemantic : No , since since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral study , which is actually reproduced in the report .	-4.7385
In this he points out that " the practice of caning is continuing in the early school " .	-5.9438
Already , given the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-2.5057
That was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was ruled out in Bavaria too .	-5.2370
Before that , they came in a legal grey area , as everyone else knows .	-4.4926
It was also difficult for him to assess where the affected persons were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the limit was actually exceeded .	-6.4662
However , it could not be said that it was always tracked down .	-6.2840
That is simply not true .	-1.3253
Only in 1980 the caning penalty in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.3288
Prince Gloria of Thurgau and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's educational standards to the time then .	-4.8244
How do you see that ?	-1.5780
Michael Hesemantic : We historians talk about the " Fallneck of an anachronism " , that is , the danger of judging past moral standards .	-5.6203
The Fürstenin is right .	-3.3762
Of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which at all times has been horrendous and not to what has been done in the pre-school in conflict and violence against innocent sex offenders , which goes far beyond the usual ones at the time .	-8.0584
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .	-4.1943
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.5239
His means of discipline and punishment , that is to say earprints and ears to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-5.2239
When physical punishment was banned , it was strictly forbidden .	-4.4156
What picture of his rainy season did Georg Ratzinger play in the talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.2770
Kam also discusses the subject of caning punishment in the language ?	-4.4119
Michael Hesemantic : Now , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , tells of his perspective , as the Cathedral plays only a secondary role .	-5.9867
Nevertheless , I do not hide the fact that it produced a strict regime there .	-4.9513
But it must also be said : without this cunning delegate without the command of an absolute discipline , it would have been difficult for him to leave an institution of world rank , true cultural treasure in Europe and its musical tradition , which had been on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-9.5350
With Keksen and Bonbons alone , one makes out of restive hacks once no big singers and every success , no matter what area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-7.5129
What kind of man did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks to her book ?	-4.3486
Michael Hesemantic : By working on the book and beyond , I have really experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and have always experienced himself as wonderful , humorous , honest , deeply motivated and heartfelt people , from whom you can not imagine that he could even do something with flying .	-10.9804
I regularly get to know how many former home spas are still today , 23 years after its emergency , keep him regularly in contact with him , read him , he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .	-9.7863
So those who have not yet given him that he was strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.1031
Most of his domains are grateful to him for having enriched his life and brought the world of music to them .	-5.5154
And that he has always been a good , väter teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a amiable person of respect to which they are still chasing and which they even worship .	-7.5459
And , once again , I would like to make it quite clear that all the methods of education that were put forward were on the agenda at the time .	-6.7014
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .	-2.8595
But it is highly unfair to make a man , just because he is more prominent and has an even more prominent brother , a scapegoat for the media .	-4.2512
The evil intent behind it is all too obvious .	-3.0465
The report that has just been published reduces its burden .	-6.3918
Now , the decency , a 92-year-old man , who has acquired great merit and would , without the outside of Bavaria , and perhaps even Germany , no one would know of the airports of Potsdam , would finally be able to go into peace .	-10.6362
