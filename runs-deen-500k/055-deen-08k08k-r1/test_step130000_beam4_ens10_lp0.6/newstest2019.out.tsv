In addition , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop concessions will be tested in two Sainsbury stores , the first week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year in Selly Oak , Birmingham , will be opened .	-9.6030
Online shopping and a shift to the daily shopping of small quantities of food in neighbouring shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit .	-4.3127
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury ’ s , said that the sales offices will look more and more like merchandise , as the supermarket chain tries to combat discord like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-5.5785

One source said , “ It was really high on Holly ’ s list of priorities . ”	-2.1777
It should be its long-term future and secure it for the next decades .	-1.9468
Their decision to withdraw was completely absurd by all the parties involved .	-4.1897

Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his rally speech .	-2.9529
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.2668
" We wanted to war with North Korea .	-1.5569
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.5867
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-1.7182
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have produced positive results , such as ending missile tests , liberating hostages , and returning the mortal remains of American soldiers home .	-2.6700
And he defended his unusual approach when he spoke of relations with Kim .	-1.9774
" It is so easy to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people out who are trying to get into this fully packed arena would stand around 200 people exactly there , " Trump said , and showed the amount directly before him .	-5.9885

While Save the Children comprises a team to travel to Palu , it is still not certain whether foreign staff can work on the ground .	-3.9250
The spokesman of the National Civil Protection Agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations should contribute to aid measures .	-6.8538
Unfortunately , given the earthquake that Indonesia is constantly enduring , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-3.1721
The town is located in the southwestern part of Aceh .	-8.7025
The obvious absence of a tsunami warning in Palu , although a warning was in force , may have contributed to the loss of human life .	-3.2885

His conjunction would be poetic justice to his Taliban and similar destruction of so many cultural and religious artifacts of England by his fanatical puritans .	-4.7716

America Should Double All-Intelligence spending	-3.2046
While China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , Investor , and AI practitioners who worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.8162
These demands were made after US government officials announced AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-4.2176
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the area of KI innovation .	-2.8033
“ doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is about to be achieved , ” said Lee .	-3.8927
The doubling of funding could double the chances of achieving the next artificial intelligence achievement in the US , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.3019
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI companies , Face + .	-4.0799
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player , and later served as a leading player in Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s Chinese branch .	-7.0700
Lee has recognised the US government ’ s former technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Force Authority ) , and asked when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.5460
“ Researchers in the US often have to work hard to get government subsidies , ” said Lee .	-2.7491
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but the companies , ” noted Lee .	-2.8463
In recent years , Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have stopped coryphals from universities to work with KI .	-3.2232
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-3.2956
“ I think Green Cards should be provided automatically to Doktornen in KI , ” he said .	-4.6066
In July 2017 , the Chinese Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan .	-2.3301
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , said Lee .	-3.5123
Earlier this year , the United States established a joint Artificial Intelligence Center , which is intended to involve partners from industry and science , and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-4.7170

As far as the NSF is concerned , it currently invests more than $ 100 million per year in AI research .	-2.3240

Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether to change the country 's name .	-1.4187
On Sunday , the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether to change their name in ' Republic of North Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-4.2931
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim on the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.3338
The two governments signed an agreement in June based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-3.2068
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum , and , in view of a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the result will create the 50 % barrier , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-4.6921
The question on the vote on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership by adopting the agreement with Greece ? '	-3.0987
Advocates of the change of name , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing to include institutions such as the EU and NATO to Macedonia , one of the countries that will emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.2677
“ I have come today to vote on the country ’ s future ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in more security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-10.3092
Although not legally binding , sufficient Members have said that they will stick to the result of the vote so that it becomes crucial .	-3.4961
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for the change of name .	-2.3524
The Landtag Election Committee said at 1.00 p.m. that there was no news of irregularities .	-4.0315
But the turnout was only 16 % – the figure of the last parliamentary election in 2016 was 34 % at the same time , and , in the end , 66 % of registered voters voted .	-4.6069
“ I went for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-3.2334
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son , Dushko , gave their vote for the referendum in Macedonia on the amendment of the name of the country , which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-4.3595
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and set chairs in front of the tents set by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.6630
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to take part with the heads upwards , not through the door , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.5205
“ We live in a poor country , but we too have our dignity .	-1.6250
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn others like China and Russia to join Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.4041
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia , a country with a unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.6414
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev declared his vote after his vote was given .	-7.4833
According to him , the “ yes ” result would be a “ reinforcement of our future . ”	-2.9467
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute of Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-3.1098
Another survey carried out by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV revealed that 57 % of the respondents cast their votes on Sunday .	-3.1139
Of those who want to participate , 70 % agreed to vote “ yes . ”	-3.8135
The referendum will only be approved if turnout is above 50 % .	-3.2262
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office last May .	-2.8582
View : Sergio Agüero from Manchester City disappears on the way to the gate the entire Brighton defense .	-4.1348
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling made Brighton ’ s defense at the Manchester City-2 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-3.0063
Aguero made his hit look incredibly easy in the 65th minute .	-3.9691
At the beginning of the sequence , the Argentine storm received a passport in the middle field .	-3.0611
He trumped three defenders from Brighton to stand up .	-6.6106
Then Agüero was surrounded by three grassroots shimmers .	-5.9472
He encountered a defender before ranking multiple players on the edge of the Brighton Circle .	-5.1423
Then he left a passport and left at Sterling .	-2.7215
The English storm used his first contact to play the ball back to Agüero , who then took his right shots – past Brighton Torwart Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gate .	-5.4763
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City-Manager Pep Guardiola den Reporters .	-2.2168
" We talked about it ; he played 55 to 60 minutes .	-2.4814
That has happened .	-1.4585
Fortunately , he shot a gate at the moment . ”	-2.0052
However , it was Sterling who first led Sky Blues at the Premier-League Duell :	-2.7987
The Gate came in the 29 minute .	-2.0392
The game was played by Aguero the ball deep in the territory of Brighton .	-2.7471
along the left side of the road with a beautiful Steilpass to Leroy Sané .	-5.4938

Scherzer wants to play against rock !	-2.0565
Because the national players were excluded from Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-3.5556
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to be able to beat the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still Playoff implications for the rockies that have a lead from a game in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-5.5362
The Rockies secured at least one place in advance with a 5 : 2 victory over the nation on Friday evening , but the title winning in the first league is still not safe .	-5.8279
" Even though we play for free , we can at least bear witness because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best that has to offer us this year .	-4.2417
Why should I not try to ' .	-2.7553
The nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to throw Scherzer in such a situation .	-3.7723
Scherzer , who would make his 34th start , gave up on Thursday and took his normal rest day .	-3.0953

Trump continued , “ You see this terrible , terrible , radical Democratic Group , you see that it is happening right now .	-2.9716
And they are determined to regain power with all the necessary means , and they will not stop in the face of Boshtians and communities either .	-6.9089
They are not concerned with whom they are violating , who they have to cross to get power and control , that is what they want , power and control , we will not give them .	-4.3133
“ The purpose of the Democrats is to oppose and block itself , ” he said .	-2.5984
" And you see this in the last four days , " he said and called the democrats " angry and common , evil and false " .	-3.5589

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.0038
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.8995
When I voted for the local party ’ s momentum activists to criticize me , it was hardly a surprise .	-3.9234
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs who say that we are not welcome - only because we have said our opinion .	-3.9008
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , was treated in a similar way because she was firmly opposed to anti-Semitism .	-2.9072
In my case I have been criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.0293

The communication for the East Labour in Nottingham on Friday states : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-2.8150
Most of my time as a local Labour Member in the eight years , the GC meeting on Friday evening was exactly the same .	-3.0792
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a more friendly , more gentle policy is long forgotten if it ever began .	-4.0905
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and each opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to party leaders .	-4.2253
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s assumption , because those of my previous colleagues who thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to make a U-turn and to take positions that I would never have agreed with , whether with regard to national security or the EU internal market .	-7.5728
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in social media that calls for demolition is condemning the center ’ s politics and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-6.0088
This experience has not only made me .	-3.2863
I do know that there is more luck than some of my colleagues , since the comments that concern me tend to be political .	-3.3891
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are exposed every day to a flood of sexist or racist abuse , but never deter .	-4.1423
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the scale of abuse has normalized .	-2.2023
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.0491
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules , the party becomes smaller .	-4.2314
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to pull my neck , not to be so loud , and then I would be “ right . ”	-4.6113
That is why I have not come into politics .	-2.0720
Thirty-two years ago , as a student , I joined a Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , which led to my classroom literally collapsing , so I tried to use better public services for those who need it most .	-11.2371
I have never hidden my political views , nor at the last election .	-2.6406
As far as my political positions were concerned , no one in Nottingham East was confused in any way , and the same applies to areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership .	-4.0610
To those who supported the Friday application , I just want to say that I do not understand why they waste time and energy to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that harms households , businesses , and our public services .	-4.5689
But the only message I have is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum , but to my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not withhold threats to elect or political opportunities from work , which , in my opinion , is the best interest of all of you .	-5.0421

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr unbeatable at the top .	-2.7237
Two late tries may have distorted the end result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderful entertaining Tennent 's Premiership Match of the Day .	-3.5758
They are the only unbeatable of the ten teams that run the table .	-3.0490
It was the pleasure of the host ’ s outstanding defense , but also of the better use of opportunities .	-7.9048
" We have been tested so far through our games and we are still unbeatable , so I have to be happy , " he said .	-3.6599
Robin Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-2.3192
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute transformed by Frazier Climo brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s Captain Rory Hughes , who was given to the game of Warriors , allowed melrose to speak , and Jason Baggot to make an unrelated attempt .	-4.6304
Climo , the leader of Ayr , met with a punishment before he reached a strike directly at half and then made a solo search with which he went to the 17 : 5 pause tour for Ayr .	-8.7483
Melrose started the second half season well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform from Baggot reduced the backlog to five points .	-3.8596
After restarting , Ayr was able to build a truy of Stafford McDowall-Climo .	-6.6957
Ayr 's current captain , Blair Macpherson , then got the yellow card , and again Melrose left the extra man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt to pay at the end of a curse of heavy pressure .	-6.0381
The home page returned , however , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a bag without Climo ’ s crowd , MacPherson made a touchdown , the forward Ayr in the back .	-6.5677
Climo converted , as almost after the reboot , after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong Boxkick started and sent the winemaking Gregor Henry to the pass in the direction of Try number .	-5.7062

Throughout the entire Bolivia , memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody conflict of resources in the nineteenth century is still alive - just as the desire to go back to the Pacific .	-9.1777
These hopes may be at their peak for decades , as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment by the International Court on 1 October after five years of discussions .	-6.8405
" Bolivia has the dynamics , the spirit of unity and calmness , and naturally expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.6328
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will find Bolivia ’ s claim that after decades , Chile will have to negotiate unsettled talks to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-5.5272
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a disputed re-election campaign next year – much depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-3.2312
“ We are about to get back access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he commented at the end of August .	-2.4870
Some analysts , however , consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about any change .	-3.4898
The Dutch UN body has no authority to allocate Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.6566
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after the hearing of the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-3.7871
And , far from advancing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years could have withdrawn it .	-3.9103
“ The question of access to the sea is being used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes , ” says Zárate .	-3.1060
Moral warlike rhetoric destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , she proposed .	-2.2589
Bolivia and Chile will sometime resume the negotiations , but it will be difficult to continue the talks after that .	-3.3365
The two countries have not exchanged ambassadors since 1962 .	-1.1176
Former President Eduardo Rodríguez Veltzé , Bolivia ’ s representative in The Hague , returned the idea that the court had unusually quickly decided .	-2.9457
On Monday , Bolivia will provide “ an extraordinary opportunity to begin a new era of relations with Chile , ” as well as an opportunity to put an end to “ 139 years of disagreement with mutual benefit , ” he said .	-4.3715
Calzadilla also denied that Morales , who continues to be regarded as one of Latin America ’ s most popular president , is politically using the issue of access to sea for its purposes .	-7.8226
“ Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean , ” he added .	-1.1670

North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not happen unless it can trust the US .	-1.3628
North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never defuse its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington .	-2.9814
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday .	-0.9991
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit of the two rival leaders in Singapore .	-2.1676
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume the diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament three months after the meeting with North Korea ’ s dictator , Kim Jong Un , in Singapore .	-3.4507
Ri says that it is “ a dream , ” that sanctions that continue to be imposed and the US contradiction against a statement that ends the Korean War will ever force the North to its knees .	-6.1828
Washington would not agree with the statement that Pyongyang has taken comprehensive disarmament measures .	-3.4671
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit .	-1.5816
But it is widely questioned that Pyongyang is not forgiven his arsenal of arms , which the country probably regards as the only way to guarantee its security .	-5.9665

The most extravagant piece of Valentino was a haunting hat with a fencing wide edge that flooded the heads of the models .	-5.1223
Other overdimensional accessories were watermelons with dirt , a magic gesture , and even an anas , but they are not meant to keep the head warm .	-4.1898
Thom Browne showed a number of bizarre masks - and just in time for Halloween .	-2.0395
Many of the colorful masks had accumulated lips and resembled more Hannibal Lecter than Haute Couture .	-3.4134

The overdimensional huts have glued to the heights of " La Bomba " , the straw hut with a 60 cm wide range , which is seen each from Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski .	-6.8317
The cult label behind the highly unpractical hat being sprayed via Social Media sent another large creation on the running steam - a straw pocket that was almost as large as the bathing suit model that weighed it .	-10.2012
The orange bag , filled with raffia-saum and white leather , was the outstanding piece in Jacquemus ' La Riviera SS19 collection at Paris Fashion Week .	-5.2621

Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic quality that continued in 2018 with excellent results in auditing and individual success in the field of sport , art , music and other Community operations .	-5.8962
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , aim to offer their students and parents the best level of service .	-3.3774
Independent schools are designed to prepare pupils – to further education , including universities , to their desired careers and to their role as citizens of the world .	-4.8369
In the educational sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , while realising that modern languages in schools are still popular and desirable .	-4.1166
Nelson Mandela once said : “ If you speak to a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-2.1605
If you speak with him in his own language , it goes to his heart . ”	-3.3054
This illustrates impressively that we cannot rely only on English language if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .	-4.2876
This year 's audit results show that languages are at the top of tables with the highest ratios in independent schools .	-3.3374
68 percent of students studying foreign languages have reached the so-called “ Higher grade A ” higher class A .	-3.7954
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 % of students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among the pupils who learnt from German , French and Spanish each , 72 , 69 and 63 reached the Note A .	-7.1234
This shows that independent schools in Scotland encourage foreign languages as essential skills that will undoubtedly require children and young people in the future .	-3.1148
In the courses of independent schools and elsewhere , the same rank as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , natural sciences and technology ) are available .	-5.4922
A UK Employment and Qualifications Survey in 2014 found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty occupying vacancies should be attributed to a lack of language knowledge .	-4.7966
Therefore , language knowledge is becoming increasingly imperative in order to prepare young people for their future .	-3.9547
With more prospective employment opportunities that require languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.9447
Irrespective of the career that someone chooses when he learned a second language , he will in future have a real advantage with a lifelong ability like this .	-3.9823
By allowing to communicate directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of competitors .	-3.0797
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a discussion , and French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.5371
This is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-3.4233
When children learn to speak multiple languages – particularly those of developing countries – they later have better opportunities to find meaningful employment in the labour market .	-3.3138
Schools in Scotland differ in their language offer .	-1.9708
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .	-3.2599
Whatever your child 's interests , you will always have a number of languages in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-4.4913
Independent schools in Scotland want to provide a learning environment that is well prepared for children and is intended to preserve the necessary armor for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-4.9970
In today ’ s global business world , languages remain indisputably important for the country ’ s future , and this must also be reflected in education .	-3.2900
Indeed , modern languages should really be viewed as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.3226
Independent schools will continue to offer this selection , diversity and top quality to young people in Scotland .	-2.1862

President Donald Trump begins this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.5689
It is the first of five planned electoral events next week , and Trump also visited the Republican states Tennessee and Mississippi .	-3.9383
While endorsing his candidates for the vacant place in the Supreme Court is still unknown , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , otherwise fear that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-6.3065
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye tonight and how can they be viewed online ?	-2.3980
Trump 's Rallye in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this evening , , Saturday 29 September 2018 .	-3.9553
You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online via live stream on YouTube .	-2.6858
Trump will certainly respond to the hearings held this week about the allegations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , who has to be confirmed in office by the Senate by at least one week by the end of the FBI investigation .	-5.7094
However , the main objective of these electoral events is to mobilise the Republicans , who will have a decisive election in November .	-3.8652
According to Reputers , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week to defend and strengthen the majority of Republicans in the Senate and Representative House .	-6.1055
“ The Congressional majority is on the president ’ s agenda , so he visited as many states as possible on the eve of the turbulent election season , ” a spokesman for the Trump campaign , who , by the way , does not want to be called .	-6.9265
According to the Radionetrack West Virginia MetroNews , this evening ’ s election event in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of Pittsburgh ’ s media .	-4.6058
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points , will be visited this month for the second time .	-2.4711
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate , Patrick Morrisey , who is lagging behind in the polls .	-2.7010
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , Politologist at the University of West Virginia , said that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president had to come to improve his poll values .	-3.3668
Ryder Cup 2018 : The Team USA is ready to fight to sustain hope for the Sundays singles .	-4.8919
After three one-sided encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-3.1220
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that the players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-6.7865
So where would they say the momentum is now ?	-2.0713
“ You had a six-point lead and now there are four , so it seems to be a little momentum , ” said Jordan Spieth , when he went back for the day . ”	-4.8971
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of four points , and twelve others are still to be played .	-4.0274
However , as Spieth says , Americans feel somewhat windy in their sails and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justice Thomas who played the whole day together and each scored three of four .	-5.0584
Spieth was thinking about it from the outset and set an example .	-3.3620
These chicken jury cries were louder when his round went on , he poured a decisive putt to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas left 2 points after playing 2 .	-8.9699
His joy at the 15th hole with which they won the game was such that one thought he still won the victory of the Americans .	-4.2951
" You really have to focus on yourself and only worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.7437
This is all that each player has left .	-3.6353
18 holes to leave the impression .	-1.0913
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.7870
Europe 's strange but admirable couple plays flawless and just makes things right .	-2.8355
" Moliwood " was the only couple that did not achieve a Bogey on Saturday afternoon , but it avoided them on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-5.3271
This race , and the way in which their energy seems to flow from and from this displaced spectator , makes it a favourite on Sunday and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who defeats a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-6.7231
Probably both in different holes at the same time .	-2.6092
Speaking of a European victory now would be too premature .	-2.2127
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.2974
With a bogey and two doubles , the first nine , the Spaniards , and the Swede , grew into a hole that they never came out again .	-9.1123
On Sunday there is no one helping you out of your hole .	-3.0346
Due to the interactions between the pairs , given advice , non-given advice , and the way in which a strategy can change in the handicraft , it is very fascinating to observe the football and footballs from close quarters .	-6.3205
As a team , Europe has played a better role and took on a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome-session has also shown that the team US has the pleasure of fighting , as some , particularly stateside , have doubted .	-7.0176
Europe is leading 10-6 on Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.8062
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-4.5303
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two wins over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring its previous record in the Le Golf National to four points .	-4.0217
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who ran around the maintenance of the trophies she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated a American team in the moroccan football and won the series with 3-1 .	-6.2222
The US offered more resistance in the Four and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.6802
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games from Sunday to keep the trophies .	-3.1525
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called Molliwood , are only the second couple that wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-4.1002
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed into the Fourball , it was considered certain that they would beat an even clearer 5 & 4 a sober Woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau .	-6.0341
Woods , who was beaten by two parties on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has lost 19 of his 29 parties in four balls and four and seven after .	-5.9341
Justin Rose , for tomorrow 's Fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-4.9953
However , on a pleasant day south-west of Paris , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.7363
On Saturday two points , the three major winners Jordan Spieth and Justice Thomas set the standard for the Americans .	-3.9060
They won a brave 2 : 1-victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and returned later to strike Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in a four-pack after losing the first two holes .	-4.0881
Only two times in the Ryder Cup story , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , though Halter Furyk 's side only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-5.9566
After two days of the second time , however , a Sunday conter looks like he would go beyond them .	-4.0691
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” one-sided disarmament without confidence .	-2.6639
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that under such circumstances , the country would in no way abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally .	-4.2921
Ri Yong Ho , the annual General Assembly of the World body , said that last year North Korea took ' major goodwill measures ' , such as the suspension of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of nuclear testing , and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-8.6602
" But there is no response from the US , " he said .	-2.8469
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances , there will be no possibility that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-6.8855
While Ri resurrected the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to decommissioning , in which North Korea would be gradually rewarded , his statement seemed meaningful in that it did not completely reject unilateral decommissioning , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-6.0520
Ri drew attention to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on June 12 , when Kim committed to working on a “ dissecting the Korean peninsula , ” while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea ’ s security .	-5.3592
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.7950
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of the harsh international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.7389
The United States insists on ' denucolarization-first ' ( first decommissioning ) and increasing pressure from sanctions to achieve its purpose in an imperative way , and even reject the ' war end ' declaration , said Ri .	-6.9945
" The perception that sanctions can force us into our knees is a dream of people who are ignorant to us .	-3.1176
But the problem is that ongoing sanctions exacerbate our mistrust . ”	-1.9334
Ri mentioned no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which was highlighted by the US President at the beginning of the week at the United Nations .	-2.8111
Instead , the minister has had three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months and added : ' If the party were to be in the question of dissolving South Korea and not the US , the nuclear disruption of the Korean Peninsula would not have fallen into such a dead end ' .	-7.3969
Yet Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he told the U.S. N. The General Assembly that targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called the “ rocket man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.6768
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy ” North Korea , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarmament , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea eliminated the decommissioning .	-5.1338
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe for this and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.7390
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.3107
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , the UN Security Council said on Thursday that , ' Enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without imposition until we implement the complete , final and verified thinking ' .	-5.5814
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-3.4196
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.5907
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-1.6963
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress had been made , and only a few hours after that , North Korea condemned him to “ pro-Europeans . ”	-5.4046
In a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a rocket location and also a nuclear complex when the United States adopt ' relevant measures ' .	-4.3378
He said to Kim that the " appropriate measures " he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.1397
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough rest .	-1.7847
With a new course at Harvard University this year , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of the study of the colourful “ thought-out nights . ”	-4.7917
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unavoidable when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.4675
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , developed the course he thought is the first of his kind in the US .	-3.6116
It was inspired to start the course after holding a talk about the impact of sleeping shortages on learning .	-3.3104
In the end a girl came to me and said : " Why is it that only now , in my final year , said ?	-4.5368
She said that she never told anyone about the meaning of the sleep , which surprised me , " he told the telegraph .	-4.1936
The course offered for the first time this year explains to the students the basics of how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general .	-3.9409
Paul Barreira , a professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-4.6266
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.3876
In one section there is an image of a sleeper hall where students click on coffee , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance influences the sleeping shortage and the importance of a sleeping timeframe .	-6.9500
In another section , participants are explained how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , sluggish , depression , and cancer .	-4.6020
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives .	-2.1674
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-1.5253
" But we believe that they have a right to this - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Czeisler added .	-3.3796
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students makes sleep deprivation a growing problem .	-3.7251
To have sufficient sleep of good quality , should be a student 's " secret weapon " to fight stress , exhaustion and fear , he also said - not to accept sleep because sleep deprived the brain into famine mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-6.1538
Raymond So , a 19-year Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design his course after attending one of his classes in Harvard last year .	-4.1391
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a campus wide course .	-2.1866
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all the doctors to complete a similar study program before entering the high school .	-3.6613
Prof. Czeisler recommended students to set an alarm when they should go into bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting , which may cause their circular rhythm to get out of the clock , causing problems of inhibitions .	-13.1114
Living ton 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal Returns Gerrard ’ s Mans	-4.0866
Further external problems of the rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , the 1 to 0 defeat in Livington came to the uncommon team of Steven Gerrard .	-7.3196
The team of Gary Holt , however , added his second defeat to Gerrard in 18 games as trainer , who left his team at eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke ’ s Premiership chief Hearts .	-7.1860
Menga landed a hit and an unconsiderable ranger setup seven minutes before the half-time period , not that they could a balance .	-6.8118
Whereas the rangers now fall into the sixth place , Living ton climb to rank three and are only because of the torque difference behind Hibernian .	-5.3889
New difficulties for the margins are emerging , because the Linienmage Calum Spence had to be given a head when it was hit by a litter item – apparently thrown away from the foreign sector .	-9.4621
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed away to Ayr and caught directly into the semi-final of the Betfred Cup .	-5.8206
Holt , on the other hand , raised the same Livi elf , which removed a point last week 's Hearts , and he should have been more enthusiastic about how his well-trained team left the opponents at no time for action .	-7.0944
The Rangers dominated the ball and Livingston were better off .	-5.0350
They should have met only two minutes after Menga ’ s first stop Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregors Gate , but the midfield player desperately abandoned his great chances at the gate .	-6.8973
A deep release of Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only go a long way towards a lagging .	-5.1173
The rangers took over control , but there seemed to be more hope than to leave the game in the last third .	-4.0022
Alfredo Morelos clearly felt , after the first quarter of an hour , that he had earned an elf meter after he and Steven Lawress clashed , but SchiedsJudge Steven Thomson did not go to the calls of the Colombian .	-7.7997
The Rangers are only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper , Liam Kelly , was hardly Lassana Coulibaly ’ s headscapegoat and hit a bit of a bit of Ovie Ejaria .	-6.6519
Although Livis 's opening meeting may have been contrary to the game at the 34th minute , nobody can deny that they deserve it for their efforts alone .	-4.8287
Again the rangers failed to master a Jacob standard situation .	-1.8162
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that preserved the peace and revealed Menga for a simple finish .	-4.3263
Gerrard acted during the break when he converted Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change immediately had an impact on the game when the winner played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ranked from his line to block .	-10.2872
But Livingston repeatedly sought to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett wearing long balls .	-5.1696
Holt ’ s team could have extended its leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well placed to deny Jacobs before Lithgow was headed from the corner .	-6.4692
The Rangers representative Glenn Midleton had another delayed claim to a penalty because he was devastating himself with Jacobs , but once again he saw his eyes away from Thomson .	-6.0587
Almanach : The inventor of the Geiger Counder	-3.3052
And now one side of our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day on which the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger in Germany , was born .	-4.0576
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually led to the device known as the Geigerteiler .	-4.7200
The Geigercounter has since also become a mainplay of science , as in the 1950 ’ s of the film “ Bells of Coronado ” , which seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-7.5656
Man : " What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.2301
Rogers : “ It is a Spirit counter used to find radioactive minerals like Uran .	-2.9628
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-6.7415
Evans : “ Tell you , but now it is crazy ! ”	-3.8217
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.1117
But the invention that bears its name will continue to be used .	-2.3457
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-1.3988
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-1.6758
Vaccine teaches the immune system to detect malignant cells as part of the treatment .	-2.5602
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of this in the laboratory .	-3.1159
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancer species , and then inject it again .	-2.9404
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancer species .	-2.7515
A woman treated with the vaccine that provides the immune system with recognizing rogue cells seemed to disappear their egg stock cancer for more than 18 months .	-5.0426
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , modify them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many cancers , and then to inject cells again .	-4.0913
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland said : " Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-2.2059
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer , ” including breast , egg , lung and intestinal cancer , Prof. Berzofsky said .	-3.9627
A similar approach to capturing patients ’ immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukemia .	-4.0465
After appearing on Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , with MAGA cap , sent a pro-Trump tirade from the stack .	-5.7993
It was not good .	-1.1919
Kanye West was buried in the studio during a Saturday Night Live Session after an exaggerated speech in which he commended the US , President Donald Trump and said he would go to 2020 .	-7.1679
After running his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while holding a Make America Great hat , he hated the Democrats , and confirmed his support for Trump .	-9.7601
" As often as I speak with a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.8773
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been exhausted from America long ago , , " he .	-3.0840
The saturday-Night-Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon , on Brett Kavanaughs ’ statement to the Senate ’ s Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Fords , Kavanaugh was sexually curious , funny .	-6.5001
Although it was not broadcast , the film material was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-3.7675
It is not clear whether Rock has tried to pocket West with the contribution .	-6.7924
Even West complained to the audience that he had had had been hard behind the stage because of his head covering .	-5.0375
" They sent me behind the stage .	-2.0048
You said , ' Don 't go with the hat . '	-3.4115
You have annoyed me !	-1.1295
And then they say that I am in a place placed , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.5543
Wed continued : " Want to see the place of trying ? " said that he would attract " my superman , because that means you cannot tell me what I should do .	-7.4961
Try it with love . ”	-1.5659
His comments were quoted at least twice by the audience with Buhrufen , and the comediants of Satuday Night Live seemed to be moved , reported Variety and quoted a person in words : “ The whole studio was dead still . ”	-5.8009
West was used as a later replacement for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-2.7452
West astonished many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , as Perrier Bottle disguised .	-2.6165
West received support from the head of the Conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , the twitter : “ This is for one of the most courageous spirits : DANKE , DASS DU THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . ”	-4.1581
But Talkmaster Karen Hunter twighted that West is simply " that 's what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-3.7045
“ But I will not reward anyone ( buying his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , from which I believe he accepts and distributes an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-3.8553
It is free .	-0.7662
We also , " she added .	-1.9182
Before the show , Rapper announced on Twitter that he has changed his name and now “ the leg formally known as Kanye West ” .	-4.4983
He is not the first artist to change his name and enters the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-2.5430

Conservative web sites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified by the source of the sites was linked to Waters ' Office and published the information from a Waters employee , Hill .	-5.0085
“ This unfounded accusation is totally wrong and an absolute lie , ” says Waters .	-2.7897
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for this information being taught .	-4.0462
This unfounded claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.8619
Waters ’ explanation quickly led to online criticism , including by the former press secretary of White House Ari Fleischer .	-3.2818
“ That the thing is beaten is very annoying , ” meat wrote .	-4.7000
“ This suggests that it is unsuitable as a congressional member .	-2.2688
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.1197
They must not be insignificant .	-2.3190
You must not question the plaintiff 's motives .	-1.9455
They must be calm and calm . ”	-1.6938
Fleischer seemed to compare Waters ’ response to the criticism of judges Kavanaugh , accused of critics , during the hearing on Thursday .	-3.9033
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ran next to the seated Water in the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-3.6784
“ Big , if true , ” he has sweetened .	-3.1279
In their statement , Waters said that their office " informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about the fraudulent claims .	-3.5502

Review of " Johnny English – You only live three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-3.4971
It is a tradition to look at any new film with a British tendency for Brexit , and this appears to be applied to this revival of the John English Action-Comedy Spof-franchise , which began in in 2003 with John English and was rewith " John English Reborn " .	-7.7361
Is the ironic self-satire about the abysmal mankind the new export potential of the nation ?	-2.8202
In addition to this , it is also possible to add a new dimension to the work of cinematic people .	-14.0231
It is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour , received a little clouseau , a Spritzer Mr. Bean and a stick from this guy , has contributed a single note to the guiding melody of the fire-fighter car at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-6.0027
It is also based on the traveler and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once worked in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV shows , who chaos .	-5.4288
There is one or two beautiful moments in this latest John England comedy .	-1.9382
I loved Johnny English , who approached a helicopter in a medieval armor , and the main rotor beats briefly against his helmet .	-4.0998
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially since the " serious " film branches like 007 and mission impossible self-confidently offer comedy as a ingredient .	-5.7403
The humor feels as if he is directed to children rather than adults , and for me , the mad malicious of Johnny English is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson 's Mr. Bean Stumfilms .	-5.1165
The ever-recurring premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.7393
A cyber hacker infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to horror the service agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.8818
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and struggling personality and already suffers a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .	-5.0020
Their secret service consultants inform them that , as each individual active spion has been compromised , it has to get someone out of retirement .	-4.9629
And this means that the wholesale Johnny English itself , who is now a shoulder in an noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gangs here while English offers a School of Rock Academy over Spionage .	-6.9856
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency call and reunified with its former , long-suffering Kumpel Bough , which is being played by Ben Miller .	-5.3927
Bough is now a married man who meets an U-Boot commander , an overwhelming , burschicose role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not completely in place .	-6.5386
So the Batman and Robin of the Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet at Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Fem Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.3744
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously forging the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve British computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.7065
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colorful high-jinks : when Kelllner proclaims them a French Flash Restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board of Voltas Luxusyacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a Virtual Reality Headset with the inner of Voltas House .	-6.3558
I am sure that all the registers have been drawn for this last sequence , but so lovingly and exhausted it is , this is reminiscent of children 's television .	-8.3095
Clearly .	-2.9293
And , as with other Johnny English films , can I not forget : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.5618
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week , for which five days are paid .	-2.8724
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party looks at a radical plan for British working only four days a week , but paid for five .	-3.1243
According to reports , the party wants business leaders to pass on the savings that the artificial intelligence revolution ( AI ) brings to workers by giving them an extra day .	-5.0532
The staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money back .	-5.0255
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plans to overthrow the country for the benefit of workers .	-4.5241
The Trade Union Congress has approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-4.2686
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced by the end of the year .	-3.5240
A four-day week is an objective consistent with the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and the party ’ s general industrial strategy , but this goal will not be achieved overnight .	-5.1556
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day workweek during its 2017 campaign .	-2.6579
However , the entire Labour Party does not support this move .	-3.3966
A Labour Party spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.7565
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to realize his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.7276

Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their opinion in “ 60 minutes . ”	-3.6491
The final vote on the appeal of the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , owing to an ongoing FBI inquiry regarding allegations to Judge Brett Kavanaugh , and the question is raised whether the investigation results of the FBI Republican Senators could lead to the withdrawal of their support for Kavanaugh .	-6.7985
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , a correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” asked Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead them to change their opinion .	-4.3309
Kennedy appeared more openly than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.7756
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.2019
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to judge Kavanaugh .	-1.7537
I called on him after that happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.7829
He was determined , targeted , unambiguous . '	-2.2375
Graham 's voice appeared to be cast in stone .	-2.9345
" I think about Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb reproach , " he said .	-3.6120
“ Dr. Ford , I don ’ t know what has happened , but I know that Brett has disputed the accusation vehemently , ” he added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-5.7208

" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has ensured that poverty is reduced ? " ?	-2.6322
On this Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty .	-3.6517
For this year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival , tens of thousands of people will meet at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars such as Janet Jackson , Cardi B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the real objective of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.4356
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-3.0571
In order to obtain a free admission ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole range of tasks or actions , such as volunteering , e-mail to a guide in the world , a phone call or another useful way of enhancing the objective of combating poverty and increasing awareness .	-11.9277
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 years remaining to achieve its goal ?	-2.5447
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert a real way to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel like sending a tweet through signing an online petition or online application ?	-4.8398
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters , pushing for a variety of different goals .	-3.2966
It is said that these actions have encouraged world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion that will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-3.0989
In early 2018 , the group introduced 390 insertions and announcements from its actions , at least $ 10 billion of which have already been paid or financed .	-6.7219
The group estimates that the funds made available have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world .	-2.5349
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK partnership of investors and executing organizations committed to “ helping children develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to support Rwanda at $ 35 million to end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens received more than 4,700 tweets .	-5.7646
“ With support from the British Government , donors , other government governments , and global cities like you , we can make sure that the social injustice of malnutrition is one day ’ s history , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.7464
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom that have diluted to improve the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will achieve the funding of the Power of Nutrition project of 5 million women and children with food interventions .	-5.4473
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on its website : “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.8827
Global citizens responded : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.8661
Like major civil law and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed because we are more powerful together .	-2.8744
Stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Moná will perform at this year ’ s New York event , moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-3.7639
US might use the Navy to set up a “ blockade ” to impede Russian energy exports – Secretary of the Interior .	-6.9028
Washington can use its marine , if necessary , to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted by Washington Examiner .	-6.8147
Zinke has suggested that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria – particularly in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-4.6661
“ I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-6.6418
And , according to the civil servants , there are ways to circumvent this .	-5.4675
“ The United States has this capacity to ensure that sea routes are open and , if necessary , to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , ” he said .	-3.9406
Zinke spoke to the participants in an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization itself called the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-4.6158
He compared to Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , and found that they are actually the same .	-3.3318
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels , " he said , while he described Russia as a one-way pot , with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-4.6765
The opinions come , while the Trump administration was in the mission to boost the export of its wasted natural gas to Europe , and to replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-4.9344
For this reason , members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to push Germany into a halt to the “ inadequate ” North-Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ prisoner . ”	-4.1786
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 1 billion pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-3.7072
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s resistance to the project is simply driven for economic reasons , and that it is an example of unfair competition .	-2.8927
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-7.3855
The US stance has provoked backlash from Germany , which has confirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.0288
Germany ’ s leading industrial organisation , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.4613

Warren strained President Donald Trump during routine meetings and said that ' this country is heading in the wrong direction ' .	-4.5370
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.4501
Warren did not take a hand in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court , candidate Brett Kavanaugh .	-4.1033
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote . '	-2.3816
A survey published on Thursday , however , showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters did not believe that it should run 2020 .	-2.7892

The Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international .	-2.4052
The Amicus Curiae says that under German law all applications for asylum must be judged according to the circumstances of the relevant complaint and such action violates this principle .	-4.9517
Lawyers continued to argue in the phrase that the policies that refuse to admit to immigrants are damaging the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “ do necessary work . ”	-4.7811
Public prosecutor Jeff Sessions instructed immigration magistrates in June to stop granting asylum to those fleeing domestic or gang .	-4.4540
" Asylum belongs to those who have to leave their country for persecution as a result of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a specific social group or because of political opinion , " said sessions in his statement on the law of 11 June .	-5.0664

US ambassadors bully China with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.9385
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page display in a US daily newspaper on the mutual benefit of US China trade , the US ambassador in China Beijing proposed using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.3475

China , Branstad wrote in an article of opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ is now using propaganda in our own free press .	-5.0782
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government takes advantage of the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and the press , ” Branstad wrote .	-3.1573
" By contrast , you will find limited voices at the Pekings newspaper , and will see no real reproduction of different opinions that the Chinese people could have with China ’ s disturbing economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-6.2775

The Republicans dug voters before the Midterm Elections with the Kavanaugh debacle , Warn Analysts	-3.8677
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee elected to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assaults , warning analysts that they will see a backlash in the upcoming elections , especially women .	-4.2890
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-2.6402

But the number could be higher , especially in the suburbs and younger voters , 18-29-year-olds , who may not suffer the president but often don ’ t vote . ”	-4.7223
Analysts have already noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed forward the candidates for sexual violence against the Supreme Court ’ s candidates before publicly declaring public statements .	-6.9716

Imagine that you have stayed all night to watch the complete Bellator 206 event , just to avoid the major event .	-4.8763
The San Jose plan had 13 fights , including six main fights , and was shown live in the night in Britain on Channel 5 .	-3.5989

" But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday there and we will be able to fix it only on Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-4.1906
But we are working on that .	-1.2219
Just believe me when it was switched off , a lot was written and the content was not friendly .	-8.5201
We tried to repair it , we thought it would be a technical error .	-1.5372
But that was not , it was a government problem .	-1.6677
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-1.5748
We will reduce it to five , rather than six , struggles - as we normally do - and we have tried to surpass the fans and have simply gone over .	-4.7053
It is an unfavourable situation ' .	-1.3168

The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware at the secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-10.8508
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he publicly talked about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-2.7622
He also said that after the birth of his first child a victory in the Olympic Games would have become less important for him .	-2.7532
The regular presentator of the long-running show , Kristy Young , released several months due to an illness .	-3.6931
Daley joined the first program in Lavernes , saying that he felt himself to be a growing “ less value ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-5.1657
He said , “ To this day , these feelings of low value and difference have given me the power and strength to be successful . ”	-4.5218
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , not to disappoint anyone if he did perform his sexual orientation .	-4.1667
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a high-calibre LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-3.2402
He said he was speaking because he had the good fortune of living open and without consequences , and because he wanted to give other " hope " .	-3.8273

The Forsaken Mickelson sat on the Ryder Cup saturday at the Bank .	-4.1978
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he needs to drastically improve his form so that he does not become a sad milestone .	-4.4173
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event , which takes place every two years , was placed on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk .	-3.8705
Instead of standing at the center of what is happening , as is so often the case for the US , the five-time Major winner shared his day between fire and practice rounds on the golf course , hoping to overcome its depth .	-6.0235
The 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver even at the peak of his career and is not suitable for the tight Le Golf National Square where the long rough penalises regularly .	-6.1226
And as if the place alone would not be challenging enough , Mickelson will meet in the ninth match on Sunday on the famous British open-champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neling Tommy Fleetwood .	-5.4134
If Americans have four points behind when they start the 12 individual games and have a hot start , Mickelson Match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.2816
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband , and that was what he left him . was , . was , , , , , , , , ,	-6.7424
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a brap on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.8323
“ He has a lot of confidence .	-1.7305
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-1.8863
I probably would not have thought he played two games .	-2.3104
I had hoped for more , but that was the way we had to deal with it .	-5.8695
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.2603
So far , Nick Faldo holds the record of most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which will break Mickelson on Sunday .	-4.3904
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career , which has never fully matched the heights of his individual record .	-4.4343
The team had a team of 18 winners , 20 times lost and seven-time lost .	-9.2580
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to maintain people , and he is a great guy that he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.8632
I think the younger players were also fun to measure with him this week , that was nice to see . ”	-3.6670
He offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.3395
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows that a great lead can quickly disappear .	-2.8766
Thomas Bjorn , the European Captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the last day ’ s singles can quickly become an uncomfortable rift .	-5.2823
The Dane debuted in Valderrama in 1997 , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans , but only just knocked over the target line and won with a touch-thin lead of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> . . was , , , , , , , and . , , , , , , , , ,	-12.3349
" We remember that we were in the lead in Valderrama ; we had a great lead in brookline where we lost .	-18.7108
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.7609
You will be absolutely pulled in the morning . . is . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-7.0076
Go there and make the right things .	-2.2695
It is only over when the items are displayed on the table .	-3.9607
Our goal is to win this cup , and we focus on it .	-2.9938
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are facing a strong opponent to do the best players in the world . ”	-3.2488
Björn said : " I would never be premature .	-7.4584
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.1545
Tomorrow are the personal performances , and that is another thing .	-3.3712
It 's great to be out there with a partner when things go well , but if you are out there you will be able to test your own abilities as a golf player .	-5.5152
This is the message that you have to convey to the players : Tomorrow to get the best out of you .	-4.1712
Now you are outbidding to your partner and you need to get the full involvement . ”	-7.2582
Unlike Björn , the counter-player Jim Furyk will strive to make his players cut off better individually than they do as a partner , except Jordan Spieth and Justice Thomas , who received three of four points .	-5.8544
Furyk himself saw such a sensational turn at the end of the day , when he was part of the Brookline Sieger team , now he belongs to the losers , after the European team brought about the “ miracle of Mediah . ”	-5.9911
" I remember every word damned , " he said how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had assembled his players on the way in the last day .	-3.4664
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get rid of as quickly as possible , as seen in Brookline , in Mediah .	-3.9489
If , for the first time , a dynamic of its own will exert heavy pressure on the middle matches .	-4.9282
We have built our site and put the boys out as we felt , you know , we try to create something special tomorrow . ”	-4.9255
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European at the top places in the ranking , should give the backlash against Rory McIlroy .	-4.3563
I put this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-2.9311
Renewal of the timetable for Germany ’ s new war ship	-2.2038
The new Fregates of the German Navy should have been in service in 2014 to replace the Cold War warships that had been acquired in the years , but it is now going to take at least until next year because of flawed systems and escalating costs .	-8.6979
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the chief ship of the brand new Baden-Württemberg class frequencies , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ The Time ” on appeal to a military speaker .	-4.9116
The marine should have been in operation in 2014 , but serious problems following the first delivery have affected the ambitious project .	-4.3976
The four fregates ordered by the Marine in 2007 by the Baden-Württclass will replace the ships at the Breclass .	-3.9823
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a number of defense and ship missiles , as well as some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared , and acoustic signatures .	-4.6218
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frequencies should be available for up to two years without running the home port .	-4.6780
However , the modern warships that Germany should permit overseas power projections will already be obsolete by permanent delays if they are finally put in service , as the weekly newspaper “ The Time ” notes .	-7.1454
The unfortunate F125 Fregate last year provided headlines for headlines when the German naval officially refused to start the ship and returned to Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.7404
This was the first time that the marine returned a ship to a shipbuilding company after the delivery .	-2.9821
The reasons for the return of the ships were unknown ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the war ship useless in combat matches .	-5.6108
The ship was named after Baden-Württemberg .	-9.8546
It was also apparent that the ship had a significant overweight , restricting its performance and making it difficult for future marine upgrades .	-5.0746
It is assumed that the 7.000-tonne “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II .	-3.2264
In addition to incorrect hardware , the price label of the entire project , including the training of the crew , will also be the subject of the issue .	-6.3137
Rather than the EUR 2.2 billion initially proposed , the cost has now apparently reached the diminishing figure of EUR 3.1 billion ( $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.7838
In light of recent warnings , the problems with the latest frequencies have been particularly important for Germany ’ s naval power to diminish .	-5.7270
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Committee on Defence of the German Parliament , admitted that the fleet actually took on “ the operational ships . ”	-4.5134
The officer said that the problem grew alarmingly over time , as old ships were put out of service without replacing it .	-5.6937
He complained that none of the bathing Württemberg fregates were put in service by the naine .	-4.1093

The fleet populations in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom have been experiencing a sharp decline in the last hundred years .	-4.6863
They are threatened by building works affecting their camps and the loss of habitat .	-3.6358

The organization has even established Scotland 's first and only dedicated fleet reserve in the thread estate in Dumfries and Galloway , which is home to eight of the ten Scottish fledges .	-5.7757
According to manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.5236
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for mowers . ”	-4.4725
" We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good living space .	-2.5127
But there is still a lot of unknown about flowers and the work that we do here and on other plots helps us understand better what they need to live . ”	-4.8869
He stresses that it is important to check , before maintenance work in buildings , whether or not there are any fledding mowers , and it is possible that a whole local population may be eradicated when a single sleeping area of maternal animals is destroyed .	-10.3699
Mechanisms are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disrupt them and destroy their sleeping places .	-4.7326
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.5988
She said , “ We still have a lot to learn about our paintings , and for many of our species , we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-4.2614

What they say today , Fake News , ” said the five-time balloon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-2.3286
" They want to apply for themselves by using my name .	-1.7189
“ That is normal .	-1.7527
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-1.8190
I am a happy man , and everything is good , ” the player laughed up .	-3.1511
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers make a complaint against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” because of the allegations ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ an inadmissible coverage of suspicions in the area of privacy . ”	-4.2428
Christian Schertz ’ s lawyer said that the player would claim compensation for “ immaterial damage to the severity of the violation , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years ” .	-5.1978
The alleged incident is due to have arrived at a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.2054
According to documents submitted to Clark County ’ s District Court in the state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga withdrew to a nightclub in the room of the player , where he arranged them in an anal way .	-6.9413
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo fell on her knees after the alleged incident , and said to her that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” left in the lurch of the “ 1 % . ”	-5.4443
The documents maintain that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair sex had , but it was agreed .	-5.6458
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had ' fear retaliation ' and worried about becoming ' publicly humiliated ' .	-4.6311
The 34-year-old says that she is trying to declare the agreement invalid because it remains traumatized by the alleged incident .	-4.2777
Ronaldo was close to his change to Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and moved this summer with a 100 million euro deal to the Italian giant Juve .	-4.4287
Brexit : Britain would regret losing car manufacturers forever .	-1.5724
“ The UK would regret its time-life if Brexit lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer , ” said Secretary of Economy , Greg Clark .	-5.1122
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily halt production at its plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-4.2357
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.5483
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of frontier delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.3662
The Burnaston plant , which manufactures Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.2359
“ If the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe it will come in our production stops work , ” said Marvin Cooke , Chairman of the Board at Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.3793
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW , and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.2563
For example , BMW has already announced that it will close its plant in Oxford after Brexit for a month .	-2.6440
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers are saying about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.5653
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on needs oriented manufacturing , that is , the parts will be delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the UK and the EU for special arrang.	-5.4192
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border which , according to industry information , can lead to shortages and partial shortages .	-3.4517
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stock in his Derbyshire work , said the company , and thus would stop production .	-3.6782
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was ‘ calibrated precisely to prevent those checks at the border ’ .	-3.4332
We need a deal , we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed today , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the programme today by BBC Radio 4 .	-9.6385
“ The reference not only to Toyota , but also to other manufacturers is that we must be absolutely in a position to continue what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.7192
Toyota did not specify how long the production stops could last , but warned that in the long term the cost increase could suffer the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lost jobs .	-6.3260

Trump ’ s Rosenstein meeting could be postponed again , says the White House .	-5.5879
Donald Trump ’ s high-calibre meeting with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could “ be postponed another week , ” as the battle for the Supreme Junior Brett Kavanaugh goes further , the White House was saying on Sunday .	-6.4085
Rosenstein supervises the work of the Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible disability of justice by the President .	-7.5840
Whether Trump will fire or not the deputy prosecutor , and thus jeopardise the independence of Muller , Washington has brought a lot of trace for months .	-4.9695
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the weighting of a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th constitutional amendment .	-4.4561
Rosenstein refused to give an opinion .	-1.9439
But last Monday he went to the White House , while reports hailed that he was about to resign .	-3.8236
Instead , a meeting with Trump at the time of the United Nations in New York was announced for Thursday .	-1.5969
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the session was delayed to avoid a conspiracy with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-5.0402
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI inquiry of the claims against Kavanaugh , and continued to delay a full Senate vote .	-4.6860
Donald Trump ’ s press speaker Sarah Sanders was on Sunday at Fox News .	-1.7310
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' One date has not yet been fixed , it could be this week , I could see that I am going back another week , in view of all the other things that go with the Supreme Court .	-5.6404
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-2.3156
Some reporters would contest this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.5582
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.9460
Sanders said that the lack of letters was not an offence against television reporters who behave like self-actors , but she also said : ' I will not be against them being on the gallery ' .	-6.9214
It suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.9596
" The President has more questions and answers than any President before him , " she said and added , without evidence : " We have looked at those figures . "	-6.0832
Briefing is still going to take place , Sanders said , but the press should have the opportunity to put the questions directly to the President of the United States , so this is infinitely better than speaking with her .	-5.0666
We are trying to do a lot of this , and you have seen how we have done this in recent weeks , and it will replace a press talks if you can speak to the President of the United States yourself . ”	-4.7096
Trump answers questions regularly when he leaves the White House or takes part in public meetings or press conferences with attending dignitaries .	-3.2123
Press conferences with a person are rare .	-1.2565
In New York , the president may have shown why this week by taking a freeway and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-4.0909

But the British Government has also intensified preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-2.5907
I know that must be a very worrying time for you all .	-1.4942
That is why I wanted to repeat now how much I would value the contribution of each staff , regardless of their nationality .	-3.7256

This move is seen as an attempt to neutralize the success of Jeremy Corbyn ’ s efforts to attract young voters with promises , to offer more affordable housing , and to strive for high incomes .	-3.2153
The stamp fee is levied on people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the United Kingdom , and the extra money will help the government to fight homelessness .	-4.3411

Jack Ross , currently manager of Sunderland , says that his “ ultimate goal ” is to become Scotland ’ s manager at some point .	-3.5855

He moved to the Stadion of Light this summer after St Mirren left back to the Scottish first league .	-3.9825

The former manager of Alloa Athletic said that he had no fear of going into the footsteps of this established manager in such a large club , and that he had already rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town .	-5.5106
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I return this association to Premier League ? "	-2.4666
With its structure and facilities , this club is undoubtedly part of Premier League , ” he said .	-3.0956
“ Creating it is not an easy task , but I would probably only consider myself successful if I can get the club back there . ”	-4.6730
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching personnel .	-2.4544
He then helped Alloa recover from the relationship to the third class , and made St. Mirren the edge of the relationship the following season as master title .	-5.0438
Ross also says that during his career at Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academical he never felt as he was now .	-3.8318

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for UK pubs attacked , but has increased pressure on the restaurant chains .	-4.4649
Pub and bar groups received a sales plus of 2.7 % in July - but income in restaurants fell by 4.8 % , according to the numbers .	-4.6288
Peter Martin , the consultancy CGA , which compiled the figures , said : " Continuous sunshine and England longer than expected participation in the World Championship resulted in July following a similar pattern as in last month ’ s June , when the pub visit increased by 2.8 % , only that restaurants were more affected .	-6.9095
The decline in gas business by 1.8 % in June has only intensified .	-3.8084

Paul Newman , an RSM analysis for leisure and catering industries , said : " These results continue the trend that we have seen since the end of April .	-3.0536
The weather and the effects of social or sports major events remain the most important factors when it comes to selling in the outside house market .	-4.4752
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups will continue to be under pressure , although a 4.8 % turnover will be particularly painful next to the continuing cost pressure .	-4.5726
The long hot summer could not have come for food operators at a worse time , and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed break .	-8.6840

Milk pump advertising , where mothers are compared with cows , caused controversial online discussions .	-3.1664
A dairy pump company has caused controversial online discussions because of an advertisement comparing nursing mothers with melting cows .	-4.3142
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " world 's first silent and portable milk pump " , Elvie 's consumer tech company published an ironic advertising inspired by music video to show the freedoms of mothers being offered with this new pump .	-5.4935
Four real mothers dance in a hawkish in the midst of cows to a number with the song text : " Yes , I melke , but you see no cock " and " If you haven 't noticed that it is not your fault , it is my breasts . "	-6.7615
The slogan continues : " Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I melt my store " .	-4.1042
However , the ad published on the facebook page of the company has caused controversy online .	-2.7505
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of commentary , the video has received mixed responses from viewers , many of whom say that it looks at the ' horror ' of the dairy economy .	-4.2121
" It is a very bad decision to coat this product . "	-3.1037
Like us , they too must be pregnant and be born to produce milk except that their babies are taken away within just a few days after birth , " a person wrote .	-5.1883
The Elvie dairy pump fits unobtrusively into a styling bra ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-5.1514
Another comment made : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.9510
But why not advertise with them for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.4791
Someone else added : ' This is outdoor advertising ' .	-3.0081
Others defended advertising , including a woman who admits that she found the song “ urcomic . ”	-3.8375

I would have received one more if I had stayed .	-3.9208
I felt like a cow by pumping my foot .	-3.4778
The display is a bit crazy , but I took it as it was .	-2.1678
This is a genius product , " wrote a person .	-2.0424
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertising for mothers who pump ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-3.9473
This is not an advertising praising or judging the dairy industry ' .	-2.8504
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all dance with the devoted pumps in their hands .	-4.0083
The campaign ’ s approach is based on the recognition that many women who are pumping milk say they feel like cows .	-2.9989
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely silent , has no wire or hoses , and fits inexorably into a sill H , which gives women the freedom to move , to keep their babies and even to go to pumps .	-7.7079
Ana Balarin , Partner and ECD commented on Mother : " The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative market launch .	-3.0770
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges while demonstrating , in an entertaining and comparable manner , the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.8236

Hundreds of migrants ' children drag quietly into a camp on the Texas border .	-3.1058
The number of children arrested with migratory background rose , even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s tough rhetoric and policies made it harder to find sponsors for children .	-4.0457
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves and fear that they will risk becoming expelled when they fight for a child .	-3.6472
The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-3.6991
Last week , Matthew Alberce , a high official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , showed before the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-4.4662
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.3835
" Almost 80 % of those who are either sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegally present in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal offenders .	-3.7815
" We continue to follow these people " said Alence .	-4.6231

Those who do not want to grant discharge will quickly be deferred .	-2.5831
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is to be fearful or depressed , leading to violent eruptions or attempts to escape .	-3.3344
Supporters said that these concerns are intensified in a larger body , like Tornillo , where evidence that a child has to fight is more likely to be overlooked by its size .	-5.1052
They added that the move of children to the Zeltstadt , without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or adopt from friends , could exacerbate a trauma that many are already fighting with .	-4.5864
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.4404
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-2.6441
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that under the pretext of combating terrorism , foreign forces were illegally on Syrian soil , and “ they will be treated accordingly . ”	-4.0789
“ You must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.5726
Moualem claimed that the “ war on terror has passed nearly in Syria , ” more than 360,000 people have died since 2011 , and millions more have been displaced from their homes .	-4.1216
He said that Damascus will continue to “ fight this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign attendance forces . ”	-2.7660
The US has roughly 2,000 troops in Syria ; it is mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.3784
France has deployed over 1,000 soil soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.3255
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for the return are right , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fear , ” which led refugees to withstand .	-4.3832
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate return , ” says Moualem .	-2.5308
“ You politicize a purely humanitarian question . ”	-2.2118
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that it would be possible to rebuild Syria only if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to the end of the war were proposed .	-5.3146
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey establishing a buffer zone in the last major rebellion stronghold , Idlib , provided the opportunity to advance political talks .	-4.6300
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russia ’ s backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-2.8473
But Moualem emphasized that the agreement provides “ clear deadlines , ” which hopes that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra front associated with Al-Qaeda that will “ be wiped out . ”	-6.0063
UN Consultant Staffan de Mitura is hoping to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members in order to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections .	-4.8318
Moualem named conditions for Syrian government ’ s participation in the committee : he said that the body ’ s work should be limited to “ checking the articles from the current constitution , ” warning of interference .	-4.0815

But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador , which was estimated to receive $ 140 million of American aid in 2017 , including drug-supply controls , development , and economic support .	-4.2590

The Rangers are the host to Rapid Wien on Thursday , knowing that the victory over the Austrians , after the impressive level in Spain against Villarreal at the beginning of this month , will bring them into a strong position to qualify for Europaniga from the G Group .	-5.6446

Instead of sending him to her , she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice .	-2.5829
After she noticed her father , a " uncomfortable " Plasco-Flaxman sacrificed Mrs Maurice and stated that her disappearing child mood , which was Afro-American , had done a bad job and that she would instead set up a filipino , the New York post .	-8.4246
Mrs Maurice was paid for her work one day and sent home for a user .	-2.4009
Now Maurice suits the couple for compensation for the dismissal and demands a compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time appointment for which it was initially abandoned , albeit without a contract .	-5.5462

FBI investigations have started , and Brett Kavanaughs ’ future is at stake .	-2.1155
“ I thought that if we could indeed get something like what he had asked for - an investigation that is limited at time and scale - we could perhaps achieve a little agreement , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday , and added that he feared that the committee ‘ disappears in the midst of a deep-rooted partisan political blockade ’ .	-8.6183

Kavanaugh demented the allegations that he had been sexually attacking Dr , Christine Blasey Ford , when they were both young people .	-5.0418
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he almost fought with the tears when he spoke about his family and his high-school years .	-3.7841
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated campaign of reputation organised by liberals who are angry that Clinton lost the 2016 presidential election .	-4.9195
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement was that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , because he showed that he was prejudged against democrats .	-3.7768
“ I believe that he himself disqualified with such statements and the way in which he can be influenced by the Clintons and Democrats , ” she said .	-3.3938
When she was asked if , in the case of his confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , she was reluctant to seek an official height proceedings against Kavanaugh .	-6.6132

It is a real hetchword , months and years full of anger , and it can not smoke it without crying .	-6.1480
" We cry when we are angry , " Mrs Steinem said to me 45 years later .	-3.8447
" I do not think that is unusual , or ? "	-2.7472
She continued : “ I helped a woman once in the executive who told me that she was also crying when she was angry , but she developed a technique in which she began to rage and to cry , to the person with whom she spoke : “ You like me to think that I am sad because I weep .	-8.0239
I am angry ' .	-0.8174
And then she just continued .	-1.2062

Tränen are allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-3.0049
One of my strongest memories of an early job in a office dominated by men , in which I used to cry with irony anger , was that I was wrapped by an elderly wife at the neck , an elderly wife who always had a change in front of me - who slipped me into a staircase .	-9.2556

“ It was not a well-thought-out decision , ” she told me 30 years later with a laughter .	-2.8766
" There have already been seven more candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-5.6011
Someone called it " Snow wittchen and the seven dwarves " .	-2.1618
Because the campaign was under way for a long time ago , it was backward with funding , and so it swore that it would not participate in the race unless it were collecting $ 2 million .	-5.8577
It was a lost battle .	-1.0462
It found that some of their supporters , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give her only $ 250 .	-3.4011
“ Think about what I get in advance ? ” she wondered .	-4.7936
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not start a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who supported them to frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to raise voters instead of delegates , and anger about sexism - that she was kicked .	-5.8538

The introduction of new tariffs to US imported Chinese products worth $ 200 billion ( $ 150 billion ) this week has led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-2.5651
Beijing has revived each time in terms of services , most recently increasing the tariffs of five to ten % on American goods worth $ 60 billion .	-5.3827
China responds to any blow from the US with a backlash , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will decline in the near future .	-3.4847
To move Washington to step up is to step up calls but to bow publicly to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , the President of China .	-5.7830
But if Beijing uses its opportunities correctly , the trade war with the US can have a positive long-term effect on China by reducing the interdependence of both economies , say experts .	-4.6611
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is far more dangerous than observers , ” said Abigail Grace , scientific staff at the Center for New American Security , a think tank with the focus of Asia .	-3.8325

Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country that they had to leave because of terrorism and the unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and livelihoods are in place .	-4.4866
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled from the country since the start of the war in 2011 .	-1.6299
