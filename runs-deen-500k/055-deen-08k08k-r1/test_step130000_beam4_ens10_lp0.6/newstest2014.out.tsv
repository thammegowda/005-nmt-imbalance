Gutach : Even more safety for pedestrians	-0.9838
The new B 33-pedestrian ample was launched in Gutach on Tuesday at the village parking site , in view of the older town hall apple .	-11.0836
Two facilities so close to each other : intention or litigation ?	-3.9149
This question was answered clearly by the Mayor yesterday .	-3.0792
" The town map was installed at the time because it secures the school path " , explained Ecker yesterday .	-3.8973
The Kluster light provides both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .	-4.1040
The plant officially opened yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-2.9103
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , doctor and bank , as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-6.8653
" In the high volume of traffic and pedestrian traffic , a further traffic light had to be ensured , " Eckert .	-5.4405
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Country Board Offenburg .	-3.0002
" According to current measurements , the municipality of Gutach , which includes about 12 000 vehicles per day , is approximately ten percent heavy traffic , " said Arnold .	-6.7803
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : ' security is just about before us ' , Arnold says .	-6.2939
Four traffic watches were carried out , a roundabout was also considered , but again dismissed because of the angle in the crossing area of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-7.1862
According to Arnold , everything was previously tested during the assortment of the traffic lights : " By means of an extra charge for us with particularly long timber trims of loading trucks , we have detected whether these vehicles can move from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without turning over the traffic lights " .	-9.2829
The approximately EUR 15 000 expensive traffic light system itself is the most modern thing that currently exists on the market , " explained Arnold .	-5.9991
The complex is equipped with colourful LEDs , which are so strong that the lights are well visible from the drivers , for example in the deep sun .	-7.0025
It is also economical : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-4.0113
There are three lighting facilities per direction .	-2.3342
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .	-1.9551
If the pedestrian has the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-4.2815
If the road is free , it will immediately reach the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.7462
Another radar sensor will check if the green phase can be finished for the pedestrian .	-2.8968
" If a group or disabled people go out of the street , the green phase is extended , so everyone is sure to get there " , said Arnold .	-6.1605
Of course , drivers here must be partners and follow the path .	-6.2024
This was not the case yesterday : Kaum showed the light for pedestrians green , rugged an upper class vehicle with bright red .	-5.7206
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the need of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-2.1783
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the lack of language , the hang to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the angle and blindness - have often been described by the Carinthian poet .	-7.4795
It is known that the winner of the Buchner prize-winner is above all a prosal author , theater texts are in his work rarely .	-7.2276
Collage of prosates Gerhard Fresacher makes for his performance " Weather light on the tongue " which is now on display in Garage X at Petersplatz , therefore a collage of prose texts .	-7.0629
The theatre maker connects , for example , elements from the autobiographically shaped novel " Der Leibeigen " ( 1987 ) with Prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family belonging " ( 2003 ) .	-6.3359
On the broadly empty stage - important requirements : a scarce sofa where manually copied and masturbated - the eight-person ensemble hangs through the text material .	-6.9159
In doing so , director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-3.4762
The 70-minute performance overshadows the template with a wealth of influences of regimes , known as the repertoire of postdramatic games .	-5.9487
Especially the actors will get involved in the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic transposition . can , however , be on the .	-10.9954
They are touched , dipped heads under water , baked with their evenings on the wall .	-5.0762
Forced in cellophane or tenant , they stack on dangerously high stains through the stains , either monologize in silence or lie completely silenced on stage floor .	-7.3273
However , the text hardly conveys itself in this ambitious way .	-5.1678
The best moments will have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folklore songs .	-4.6994
It is only by the end that the twisted show comes to rest , and Winkler 's after-absurd humor stays .	-11.1543
A black box in your car ?	-5.3901
US street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling high-way system , and believe that the solution can be found in a small black box that can fit any car ’ s flagship .	-6.4145
The appliances that record every kilometre driven and report information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state ’ s planning offices to revise the outdated system for financing US US roads .	-6.0896
The usually boring area of road planning suddenly sparked an intensive debate with colorful alliances .	-3.7570
Libertarians allied with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres that have been caught , and possibly where they have gone , and then use the information to calculate tax modes .	-5.6803
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.9854
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and raises a number of data protection concerns .	-2.6902
But , while Congress cannot agree on what to do , several states no longer wait .	-3.1434
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next ten years , where drivers pay for each mile driven .	-5.9599
Thousands of drivers have already tested tachographs , some of which have GPS monitoring .	-2.3944
This really is a must for our country .	-2.2687
“ There is nothing we will only be able to use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , CEO of Southern California Assn . of Governments , who planned a record of the Miles in all California drivers in the state from 2025 .	-5.8701
The way in which we pay that tax will change .	-1.7826
The technology for this is here .	-2.0187
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from taxes paid to Americans at the ceasefire , is broken .	-4.7350
But , in America , no longer goes as much as before .	-4.1819
Cars use less petrol .	-1.1809
The national mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 Eurocent per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.3773
Politicians dare not dare to raise the tax even to raise a cent , even if spray prices are high .	-4.9023
“ The gasoline tax is simply not future-oriented , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.7467
His federal state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a milestone payment system .	-4.2092
“ This is the most meaningful long-term alternative , ” he said .	-4.3729
Bureaucrats call it a miles based user fee .	-3.2568
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberals , as the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-friendly exhaust gases are reduced .	-4.9101
California planners are focusing on the system for developing strategies to achieve the country ’ s ambitious , legally enshrined goals on climate change .	-4.7236
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he sees the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.1134
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also inspired by the idea to let drivers pay on the back track .	-5.4025
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President for Directives at Reason .	-2.2220
People pay directly for what they get .	-0.7710
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers , who , in a report in 2011 , called on Congress to move towards a milestone settlement .	-4.4606
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million last year of expensive pilot project , which would have comprised 10,000 cars .	-4.0687
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented them from taking the lead and responded to the concerns expressed by members of rural communities who often have to make many miles on their way to work or to the city on a daily basis .	-6.0946
Nevertheless , several states and major cities are moving in this direction on their own .	-4.2722
Oregon is the most committed and currently acquires 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s biggest experiment .	-3.6350
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fee instead of the mining tax to the state .	-3.9460
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.7278
New York City is also considering this .	-1.0452
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with lorries .	-1.3285
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the Department of Transport of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-3.6621
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.8803
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment recently , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could follow any of its movements .	-3.3516
“ Preferences against Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , head of strategic and outcome management in the Nevada Transport Department .	-4.5696
People did not want it .	-1.0427
As the test went , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be quite easy to turn the tachographs into large surveillance devices . ”	-5.3526
There is no need to build a huge , unwieldy technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on individuals ' daily movements .	-3.7735
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to capture the landed kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-3.9666
Thus , Khan , the public would be more reassured .	-3.1208
hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.4180
The company originally failed to help states tax drivers .	-3.2165
In fact , its aim was to take root in an emerging market for vehicle insurance , where drivers were to pay on the basis of the Mileage Property .	-6.5649
However , the devices it tested are interesting for road planners too , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is uploaded regularly via modem .	-4.3834
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and sites are not recorded , ” Ryan Morrison , CEO of True Mileage , explained .	-3.0959
Large errors have been made in some of these public pilot programmes .	-2.5129
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-1.9987
In Oregon , planners experiment with giving drivers a number of choices .	-2.3421
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.5372
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a lump-sum fee based on the miles that are generally held by all the inhabitants of the state .	-6.2942
Other posts hope to be able to sell the concept of distrustful public by providing the devices with more functions than those with others .	-3.5066
In New York City , traffic officers want to develop a tax unit that also pays parking fees , insurance only for dropped kilometres and speed data from other vehicles in real time , enabling drivers to avoid congestion .	-7.4130
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages the system offers , ” says it in a planning document of the city .	-10.0254
Some transport planners , however , ask whether the whole talk about each mile will not be just a huge manoeuvre .	-5.0611
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area , officials declared that Congress could resolve the problem of the Bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax .	-4.5402
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol to pay a fair share .	-4.4890
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirine is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of the Commission ’ s legislation and public affairs .	-4.8247
If we do , hundreds of millions of drivers will have their privacy and many other things .	-2.5682
Königsfeld : Small team beats wacker	-4.7900
The volunteer fires managed their autumn tasting despite the staffing fault .	-5.2740
Only 11 men took part in the exercise .	-0.8308
Divisionary manager Hans Kammerer had selected the estate Feder in Burgberger Straße in his rehearsal .	-6.8699
A short gear will have been created there .	-3.5512
Two people were injured as a result of the fire and smoke development , but one of them could still make a call .	-4.5691
After the first review of the state of affairs by Hans Kammerer , two resistors of the Wehrmacht agreed to enter the building .	-5.4586
After a short time , it managed to find the first person and lead to free .	-2.9595
The second person had to be worn .	-0.8087
It was not as easy as a narrow staircase was to be overcome .	-4.4504
The building , an integrated workshop for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-1.9667
It stored a lot of wood and also ribbons in it .	-4.0527
Furthermore there were still electric machinery for wood processing .	-6.3966
The first deletion was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .	-3.0421
Another direction was the hydrant flooding in about 100 meters from the hotel .	-5.7538
Three responses were now possible .	-2.6950
A high jet tube was used in the building as well .	-2.8726
Hans Kammerer also went to show what can be done with low-cost staff .	-4.3273
In the worst case , Königsfeld will support you with the day-to-day stake group .	-4.6517
The commander was pleased with the expiration of the exercise .	-2.2187
Interconnection of universities and companies important	-3.2632
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Schwarzwald , Landtagssident Guido Wolf could also find out in Titisee-Neustadt where the workers of tomorrow come from .	-6.3314
In the Schwarzwald Schwarzwald Railway Station , he and the Head of Managing Schools of the Vocational Schools as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the Chairman of the parent advisor of the Board of Directors of the Schools .	-9.9223
" Education is an important location " , emphasized Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , which presented the networked school project project " Hochschwarzwald " .	-5.5320
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education .	-2.4369
Since 2011 there has been successful cooperation in the Forest City between the Centre for Promotion , Kreisgymnasium and Vocational Education .	-6.4373
He also praised the family friendliness in the countryside .	-2.6570
" It is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to take into account the phase of carers for members , " Wolf explained , because of demographic change .	-5.9918
He also led to an increasing number of employees taking care of and caring for their families .	-8.0172
" Without employers ' support , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " Wolf said .	-4.0588
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers , he continued to say .	-2.3108
Another important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-2.2058
" For those who already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies are often left with his acquired knowledge and skills to preserve the regional economy , which contributes to strengthening the region , " the Landtag President was convinced .	-8.1297
The only way to offer sufficient training places is to meet the professional needs .	-7.6471
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.1882
On his journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he also experienced the efforts that have already been made to develop the local public transport system .	-5.9650
" Stay stubbornly and ensure that public transport is better off , " he explained to the address of the local politicians present .	-3.6300
Living an entertaining afternoon	-2.4003
The Kaul family has been inviting the Dieting-Senior to coffee , cakes and a vesper for 15 years .	-4.5803
In the past , the elderly citizens were promoted in the pitch .	-4.5677
Now it takes place in the care house of St. Josef .	-3.8306
The locals were looking forward to the delicious cakes and gates .	-3.6847
Later there were sausage salads .	-1.8147
With conventional melodies , Silvia Kimich-Bantle and her father , Karl Kiimmich , were converted .	-6.1861
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front line of the old Schulhofes to the Kirchstraße is to be reconstructed with the recovery cost of the city of Bräunlingen .	-7.0096
In the days before the killing , a small angle wall , to stabilize and static discharge of the natural stone wall , which has been built over a hundred years old with Balustrade , was built .	-10.7403
The other approach is to include Alexander Miok from the Bräunlinger Municipality , the National Heritage Office in the planning and the reconstruction of the old wall .	-7.5319
A calculation of costs will then be carried out by specialists , which will then be submitted to the Council of the Community to decide on and determine how to proceed .	-7.5419
A decision on this is expected to come next year .	-3.0951
After the refurbishment , plastering and tree planting of the old school inner court within the two side-wings of the 1912 school school , in the foreseeable future must be reconstructed as a follow-up measure , the needy limitation wall from scratch and placed on new building .	-8.9704
The historical , one hundred years old old narrow wall of the old school court to the Kirchstraße , is mostly due to water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , needs to be restrained and has a archery to the front .	-9.2898
Deep cracks in individual stones have damaging weather , but the wall is not currently under threat .	-4.3359
A secure wall is a precondition for a shoulder to use , which has been done through the current fortifications .	-5.0431
Originally , the school hof approach was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenses were shifting .	-4.8823
An important word in the historical school mould renovation , which has already been used for cinema pictures , will be discussed by the National Heritage Office .	-7.0548
Should specifications come from this site , the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monuments protectors .	-5.3332
The pupils of the primary school of Bräunlinger , who are now again taught in a well-tended old school building with a new Aula , will soon be able to use the old school courtyard .	-6.5535
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart .	-2.1294
Cem Özdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now also engaged in the ongoing discussions on the future of music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.5834
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training in the Stuttgart School of Music , " says Özdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.9248
Jazz and Classic are just a few of the Jazzstandsite Stuttgart .	-3.9206
This is against Özdemir , who , in Stuttgart , is a favourite for a direct mandate at the federal elections of 22 September , is the Green Red State Government .	-6.0072
On the basis of an expert study , this research carried out a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.0823
In addition to this , Jazz and Pop will be moved from the Stuttgart School of Music and Music from Mannheim .	-10.2986
The US border : ' Super Tunnel ' on the smuggling of drugs	-3.7736
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and shut down a super tunnel to smuggling .	-3.7275
As the US customs authorities told , the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railways and an ventilation system .	-4.1435
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of Marihuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized .	-2.5482
According to the tunnel , it was not yet in .	-3.0595
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could go through the radar , " said the US District General Staff of Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in San Diego , where an end to the tunnel was discovered .	-5.4221
Duffy said to the drug gangs : ' If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money ' .	-3.8703
Both the US authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drugs cartels .	-2.8881
Since 2006 , more than 777,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-1.8979
Property constructed by experts	-3.6277
Due to the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place around a year .	-4.7429
The sliding system was equipped to allow electrically powered cars to be used there .	-6.3374
On the Mexican side , access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-2.9674
According to the authorities , a ladder leads a depth of 20 meters to the actual tunnel entrance .	-4.2474
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters of height and 90 centimetres wide .	-2.5900
It would also have been appropriate to encourage illegal immigration towards the United States .	-3.4761
Two suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-2.0890
The third , a Mexican , was taken for the seized marijuana .	-2.7393
All three threaten lifelong freedom abuses , as officials have said .	-2.6816
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , at the San Diego press conference .	-2.3707
But it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel building .	-2.4754
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .	-2.9839
This shows the ' despair ' of drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug flag in San Diego .	-3.8640
They would do everything to get to the US .	-2.0394
No details were announced about the detainees , at least one Mexican , it was said .	-9.5733
They have to expect imprisonment of up to ten years .	-2.2191

The Jubilee of the City of Geisingen on the 1250 .	-3.7089
The return to early mention is getting closer .	-4.3279
When the year ends in a good eight weeks , the year will mark the anniversary .	-4.1220
Gestingen and church houses were first mentioned in history . was in , , , and .	-6.2409
A certificate was made in churches , in which both places are mentioned .	-4.0707
On March 15 , there is to be an official start to the anniversary year , and as Gaussingen currently has no hall , this preliminary event takes place in the place where , two years ago , both were first mentioned in church houses .	-7.8231
A number of events are planned both in violins and in church houses .	-4.1498
On a weekend between 18th and 20th July the 1250 Churches will be held in July .	-7.8699
Happy again .	-2.4538
On Friday with a festive act , on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall .	-2.8156
This weekend is also the church ’ s house festival .	-3.8593
Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the Jubilee , which is performed on three appointments .	-4.4274
On June 21 , together with the Black Forest Society solar party , on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 as the first concert in the new Festhalle Music Festival .	-5.5348
It will be ready and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date is on the last September weekend , 27 and 28 September .	-5.4702
A new chronicle will be released on the occasion of the Geisinger Stadjubilee .	-3.6661
" It should not be a chronic , however , only by Gying itself , but rather a printed work on the violins of today , consisting of violins , churches , paintings , mushrooms , mushrooms and gutmadines , " said Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-9.9817
Today ’ s homage is celebrating 2014 birthday , and today ’ s space was completed with the unions in 1974 .	-5.2936
The new chronicle will then be presented in the new Festingen Hall on 21 or 22 November .	-4.3201
In 2014 , however , it is another year with many anniversaries .	-4.2033
The narrent strohglonki begins on February 8 with a custom evening on the occasion of its 60-year-old existence , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festival banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4 .	-6.8805
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates it on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates it during the Brunnenfest on 4 to 7 July .	-6.0020
The city of Geisingen was first officially mentioned in 764 in a gift certificate owned by St. Gallen Monastery .	-3.4152
The certificate was made in churches , which was then a place of jurisdiction .	-3.5193
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .	-2.5457
The reason to celebrate this 1250 years in 2014 , in addition , the local reform is still 40 years back .	-5.9109
The Council is targeting panels	-2.8797
Should the Am Hirschen railway station be streamlined to increase traffic safety ?	-4.8625
Yes , municipal councils have decided .	-2.1932
Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 in charge .	-3.7581
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway in the coming year .	-4.1488
Especially the safety of rail links is increased - regular collisions of trains with other vehicles .	-4.7949
If the communities vote to restructure , they have to compete with one third of the costs , the rest share railways and covenants .	-5.5037
Schiltach ’ s Mayor of the Municipality , Roland Grießfer , explained to the municipality the peculiarities of the " Am Hirschen " region .	-6.2896
There the city plans to build an overbooking in the height of the tunnel mouth to the west of the railway tracks .	-5.9009
There , even larger vehicles , such as those transporting long timber , could stand by counter-traffic without having to block the track .	-5.9146
Grieshlers therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road at a given time in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-5.3704
This was controversial in the Council of Europe , because some Councils doubted the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , with his statement , brought the critics ’ mood to the point : ' Do we need to take so much money in the hands of so few vehicles ? '	-6.7947
Mayor Thomas Haas disagreed : " Hirschen " is regularly used for long-timber transport .	-3.3914
Even wood from the Kuhbach area is transported partially over this route , because up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the trail on the Häberlesbrücke , because they could not turn off the main road .	-5.9323
Furthermore , the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles which cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed Haas argued .	-3.6183
It should be forgotten that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel need to be rebuilt and refurbished , as is currently the case in Woomber , the " Am Hirschen " rail link can also play an important part for a long period of time .	-15.1055
Councils agreed to have investigated the cost of road spread .	-4.0617
Despite this , the majority of the railway lines were agreed with the measurement that the required support wall is built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstraße " for encounter traffic to around 5.5 meters .	-7.3090
On the other hand , the conversion of the railway line at Gerei Trautwein could lead to a quite different problem , which affects access to the greatly increasing " Geroltzhäuser Trail " .	-6.7318
The administration had investigated the rebuilding plans of the railways by the Brelinger Engineer Office , because it had doubts as to whether the scheduled connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would be easily feasible .	-6.8926
The study found that it was not to be excluded that road density could result in longer vehicles relocating .	-5.2125
The responsibility here lies with the city as a truck .	-5.0856
The conversion could therefore entail liability disputes .	-3.5716
Haas argued that both logging and turning off in the current state of construction should not be agreed with the conversion of the railway line .	-6.3510
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is much smaller than the other railway lines , because it is directly next to the Mitte stop , with a good view connection .	-7.1541
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be shut down so that no collision threatens .	-4.8222
The majority of them refused to approve the transformation of this rail link , as the city of Schiltach had to tackle the problem with expensive vehicles , " says the Councils , because the railways can withdraw from responsibility after completion of the construction work .	-8.6423
The body considers the conversions to the railway lines " Before Heubach " and " Ab Kuhbach " , for which cross agreements have already been reached with the railway .	-5.7239
Esa decides on large-scale space missions : Billions of missions .	-4.1341
Far Planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency now have to agree on two major projects they want to start over the next few years .	-3.7090
30 proposals were available for selection , five are still in the race .	-1.7500
Far World .	-1.1416
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers .	-1.8948
Whether there are at least one in some of them , no one knows .	-2.8897
The selection is difficult : Should you search for gravity waves ?	-4.2786
Or would you rather explore the origin of cosmos ?	-2.2394
Or flying to infinitely subdual planet planets , perhaps discovering extra-terrestrial life ?	-6.1553
These are the questions that are being asked by the leaders of the European Space Agency Esa .	-3.9630
For their Cosmic Vision program , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will significantly advance research .	-4.0781
The budget for such ' L-missions ' is about EUR 1 billion in each case .	-2.3701
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.6593
In early September in Paris , the elite of European space research came to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.7438
30 ideas were debated , five of them have now come to the closest choice .	-4.0248
Numerous bodies analyse the proposals and look after the researchers .	-3.7661
In the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-2.7928
In total , four major questions have been asked by the Esa to find answers to the Cosmic Vision Programme , which was initiated in 2007 .	-5.3379
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life ?	-1.9958
The exact incidents in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the creation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness .	-5.2072
This darkness could penetrate a large infrared scope in all .	-5.3372
And if a star planet has , under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-3.7107
In order to address this issue , the space telescope " Cheops " will start in 2017 , which will examine more accurately the 500 already known planet systems in our surroundings . can be .	-10.2699
But the possibilities are limited , Cheap is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.9998
With larger instruments , astronomers could absorb emotional planets and analyze even the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarcles " : gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity .	-6.0341
How does the solar system work ?	-1.6746
This question , too , is ultimately intended to determine what conditions exist for the creation of life .	-4.9500
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role , as well as the interaction of his magnetic field and the partial radiation from it with the planet system .	-4.9185
In our solar system , these processes can be examined in exemplary terms .	-3.8619
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already granted a M-class mission ( where the budget is around EUR half billion ) for this question .	-5.2255
The probe will start 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun closely .	-3.9450
A great deal of interest for researchers are also Jupiter and his Moon .	-4.3857
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-3.3208
For this , the Esa offers the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme .	-2.9299
The Sonde " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) will start their journey in 2022 .	-2.9149
Eight years later it reaches Jupiter and will examine the atmosphere of the planet , as well as the irritating moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-10.1330
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.7350
The world has many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws known to us are still valid there .	-4.6834
Perhaps there are also divergences that might lead the physicists to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .	-4.9577
How did the universe originate and what is it ?	-2.5511
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos emerged from the scarcity .	-3.8933
In addition to the matter we are accustomed to , from stars , planets and living beings such as we exist , there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together , and dark energy , which accelerates the expansion of the circulation .	-8.2660
So far , researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first secondary parts of the judge , nor what dark matter and dark energy exist .	-5.7512
" Euclid " has already authorized the Esa to undertake a M mission for 2020 .	-4.8610
With a special telescope , the probe will investigate the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time on the entire sky , allowing for conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-5.2609
Who Will Turn ?	-3.7652
Of the 30 proposals , only two will be left at the end of the selection process .	-1.2447
The best chances of granting as L mission , in the opinion of many experts , " E-Lisa " , an ambitious concept for demonstrating gravity waves .	-4.3891
Physicists understand changes in the structure of the space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-3.5390
They have not been proven to date .	-1.9137
Elisa could do that , hoping scientists behind the project .	-2.6569
The mission provided a two- or three-probe detector that is stationed in space .	-4.5930
Unlike plants on Earth , it could also prove gravitational waves , which were created at the original bang , providing new insights into the creation of the cosmos .	-7.5164
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray camera called " Athena " , which is to investigate black holes among others , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the external planet of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Explanet Finder " , which is to replicate and investigate .	-10.8196
Amongst other things , proposals for the pre-transfer of samples from Mars , for the research of the moon , Venus and asteroids , as well as for solar physics are already excluded .	-6.8498
Snowden is ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-2.0884
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and to cancel before the German Bundestag , if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities .	-4.7211
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where he received that asylum to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-4.0309
In a letter from Snowden that was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , he writes : “ Even if the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a breakthrough , attempting to criminalise political expression with a punitive sentence that is impossible to defend . ”	-12.3878
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.8847
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the US Government to leave charges against him .	-4.6327
The prosecution received by the US Ministry of Justice covers espionage and theft of state property .	-3.1747
The German Interior Minister , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said about time online : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to speak to German representatives , then we will find ways to make that possible . ”	-4.0676
US-Germany relations are strained by the claims that the NSA intercepted the mobile by Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-3.7610
Thomas Oppermann , the honourable Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , stated that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as a witness , if that is possible , ‘ without jeopardising it and completely destroying relations with the US ’ .	-6.1784
Strögenau , a member of the Greens , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter Feed .	-3.2003
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.0360
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA member , Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-7.3889
If Snowden says in Germany he needs a assurance that he is “ safe , ” the honourable Member says .	-4.9785
Snowden explains in his letter that he was subjected to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that expelled him from his homeland .	-3.7146
He is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.6116
Citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit to the general public .	-3.4960
In its letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved ” .	-2.5477
Frontier Airlines charges charges for hand baggage	-1.8133
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who want to miss handbaggage on their flight .	-4.2372
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or lemonade , even though it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-4.2472
The new charge applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .	-2.8126
Frontier said that if the fee is paid in advance , $ 25 was charged , and $ 100 for passengers who paid only on the flight .	-5.2382
Frontier 's predecessor Kate O 'Malley said that the cost of $ 100 is to move travellers to pay in advance .	-5.5353
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.3081
Airlines started to charge the first piece of baggage for the first and second checked baggage in 2008 .	-3.9634
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stolen as much as possible into hand baggage , which means that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded over the seat .	-6.5079
Charges are one way to get passengers less on board .	-2.6430
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-2.2966
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier , who had clearly stated that it would become increasingly difficult to find place in speciality above the seat .	-5.4728
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-2.4380
This means that a passenger may carry a baggage free at the flight of Frontier , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a similar baggage .	-4.4001
O 'Malley explained that the website of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be amended so that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the flying spot .	-8.6963
Frontier 's new hand baggage allowance will only enter into force during the summer , and no exact date will yet occur .	-8.1869
Passengers often fly over baggage charges and other charges , but airlines are happy to do so .	-4.4427
They argue that baggage transport costs money and passengers should pay that service if they wanted .	-3.5320
Many at Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-4.5205
Most so far , however , are leaving the fingers of charges for hand baggage .	-3.4372
Spirit Airlines Inc . , three years ago , demanded first fees for hand baggage and then followed Allegiant Air , another cheaper flight .	-5.1629
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , the Airline adviser , Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional fees .	-4.1006
In a December 2011 report , it estimated that the phpying baggage fee amounts to USD 50 million per year .	-4.9857
Sorensen , who previously held a management position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown to Spirit and was curious to see what would expect him at the flight if passengers were confronted with the unusual handbaggage fee of the company .	-7.1072
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth ones I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-3.5168
I was expecting teeth to see teeth and tangible discussions at the flying edge .	-6.3857
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding was as smashed . ”	-2.4618
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-3.3847
The company explained that passengers bought lemonade or juice would have to keep the whole dose and have coffee filled for free .	-4.4640
Water remains free of charge .	-4.1870
In 2008 , US Airways tried to demand money for soft drinks , but it reversed seven months later , after complaining to passengers and leaving no other large company .	-5.5638
Frontier 's move to charge charges for hand baggage if passengers are not purchased directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-4.7277
Airlines pay online travel agents such as Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-3.0265
This will give all companies an incentive to make direct purchases of passengers rather than an online travel agency .	-3.8424
Frontier has , however , gone most widely in this area .	-2.7368
In September , the company started to allocate only half the frequent flyer miles on online travel agent booking .	-4.9731
On Wednesday , the miles were once again reduced to 25 % of the route .	-3.1317
A flight flight with more than 1000 miles booked at a third party provider therefore introduces only 250 miles to customers .	-5.5822
Passengers can also book direct purchases on the website of Frontier seats .	-3.0742
Frontier has a trusted customer base in Denver , but the business shrinks and the company loses money .	-2.6609
The revenue fell by 9 % , and the capacity of the flight fell almost 13 % in the first quarter , as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-9.2239
Republic has attempted to manage Frontier ’ s finances under the sale of society .	-3.6193
The Bible	-2.0398
Gut 40 women attended the last woman 's breakfast in the Protestant parish of Bisingen this year .	-3.6221
The theme of the day in the community was " expressions from the Bible " and " Middle Ages " .	-4.6393
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the church council , went to the Biblical Spirit after breakfast in a lecture .	-4.3813
'Sprachwords contain habits , regulations or warnings ' , she explained .	-4.2319
It lost several proverbs with their respective libraries and explained the importance .	-4.9369
She called a sprinkwords like : a wooden eye is vigilant , as rodes fall from the eyes , throwing an eye on someone who gives His hands to the Lord in sleep , washing his hands in innocence .	-7.2868
Several times the speaker also advised their listeners to which proverb it was .	-4.5934
The Middle Ages speeches were taken by the church communist Christel Dehner : all good things are three , three , blue and somewhat haunt .	-7.2327
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges into the past ' .	-2.6748
In the end a tombola was lost .	-3.5879
The prices stood on a table and were humorously pursued before they were handed over to the winners .	-4.1490
Among the visitors of the breakfast round , the mayor ’ s cathedral , Roman Waizenegger , was also mixed .	-5.3331
Learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unskilled tourism .	-2.8334
At the Mecklenburgian Lakes platter a pilot project for the tourism industry started .	-3.9620
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled workers in the industry are to be qualified over three winter to specialists for hotels and restaurants .	-5.4683
" New to it is that the six-month courses with closing " , said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Working Agency .	-4.8890
The benefit is varied : the participants would not be unemployed by it , the firms trained professionals , who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-6.7049
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel- and Restaurant Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-7.0804
NSA declares that a “ internal error ” and not hacker are to be found guilty of the crash of the website .	-4.2259
The shady National Security Agency declared on the late Friday , a bug has paralysed its public website for a few hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-6.1280
“ NSA.gov was not available for some hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the SpionageAgency explained in an e-mail message .	-5.5595
The problem was resolved this evening .	-1.5798
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.9739
In the early evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not reachable for at least six hours and that is still not available for some users .	-4.5681
Before that , a NSA spokesman told the ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the authority is “ not in any way ” compromised .	-4.5243
According to the speaker , secret information is not in danger .	-3.0667
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-1.8928
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-4.1610
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not intended to enter the internal network of the target system .	-3.0935
The former supersecret NSA , whose nickname was once No Search Agency ( no such authority ) , now finds itself in the light of the public and is exposed to the widespread surveillance program in domestic and foreign countries – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA staff , Edward Snowden .	-6.6094
The growing controversy over secret services fired initial speculation about the fact that the incident today is the result of targeted Cypriot operation .	-4.7489
The number of people without jobs drowned in October at 22 to 1.307 .	-4.4297
Although the quota of 3.1 % was better than last year and also better than in September , " we would have hoped more " , says Monika Feld-Bauer , Deputy Managing Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen .	-4.7802
The fact is that many companies have so far responded to attitudes .	-3.8235
One reason for this is according to Felder Bauer : " We have hardly any skilled workers in the craft , health care and care of the elderly " .	-5.6922
Since September we have also been working on new job opportunities for staff in the hotel and restaurant sector .	-5.3264

Bombardier ’ s loss of profits following a drop in delivery figures and orders	-4.4684
On Thursday , Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturers Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percentage decline in net profits after having been pressured by declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter , as well as contractual problems in the railways .	-6.1085
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also published no flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not give any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-5.2796
At the Jungfernflug of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , only three new starts have so far been followed , which makes it clear whether the test phase is going as planned .	-6.3982
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a turn-of-the-mill of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-4.5477
Cameron Doersen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , reduced its “ out-performance ” evaluation on Thursday to “ sector performance ” in view of the fact that the share has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-6.4902
“ Although weaker delivery figures were anticipated to a large extent in the case of aircraft , we are clearly disappointed in the transport sector , ” Doerschsen said in a customer letter .	-5.8531
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program is progressing for the aircraft .	-3.6687
However , if new orders are not announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-2.9839
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries ’ aircraft series can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.7397
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and was fleeing for the first time in September after months of delay .	-3.2252
But , up to now , binding orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims on fuel efficiency and the cost savings potential of the new jet traffic aircraft are appropriate .	-5.7082
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-1.8382
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its objective of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-3.5239
On Thursday , the company management insured against analysts and the media that the program was in the schedule .	-4.4593
“ The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any more than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that while the aeroplane 's position was based on ground tests and software updates .	-6.8563
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.6386
We have decided to undertake a first flight and then to add a period of revision , which we have also done .	-4.9661
This happens throughout the entire flight programme .	-2.8059
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining being shortly thereafter , said it was from the company side .	-4.8089
However , analysts remain sceptical as to whether twelve months after the jungle the first customer can embark on a CSeries aircraft .	-3.8445
Bombardier explained that it reviewed the planning for start-up ( EIS ) and will update it in the next few months .	-3.8165
“ The slow progress of the flight test – although it appears that it is in line with bombing of internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will shift to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerschsen .	-6.0677
In the third quarter , at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share in the previous year .	-3.3663
The adjusted earnings per share is nine cents .	-3.8254
Sales were down slightly from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-1.8238
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a revenue of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.9120
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a fall of 57 last year .	-3.5552
Net orders range from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-2.7641
The order book in the Air and Space Bank was $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , unchanged against December 31 .	-4.3183
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were in our specifications , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.4783
Sales in the Aerospace Key fell 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.4464
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest rail manufacturer , announced that revenues in this saving have risen by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.2841
The order book in the transport saving was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , thus slightly increased compared to December 31 .	-4.1228
The transport profit margin has been affected by problems with settlement in some major contracts .	-3.7068
According to the management of the company , there will be new guidelines for the fourth quarter .	-3.1608
In the aftermath of Thursday ’ s trade , the Bombardier stock accounted for 8.5 % and stood at $ 4.83 Canadian , after the announcement that the Google Executive Board , Patrick Pichette , will change to the board .	-6.2203
On Thursday , the Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombing of close rivals , reported a ten-percentage decline in the quarterly profit .	-4.2434

Cocaine dependent lawyer warning against police detention of drugs must be imprisoned . .	-4.0277
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided information on the world ’ s sub-world Neil Scarborough	-3.6001
The lawyer was afraid that his hidden drug dependence could come to light .	-2.6302
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.1497
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid his secret drug addiction could be detected , was sentenced to three years .	-4.3728
Basharat Ditta , 42 , world-class Neil Scarborough supplies sensitive information about investigations into its drug trafficking activities after compromised by his own cocaine disease .	-4.9757
The “ first-class ” lawyer , “ Bash , ” laughed by criminalists , was arrested in his house in 2011 after the Scarborough Police , which he held in an earlier drug procedure .	-5.8088
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) replied three Beutel Kokain at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , during a meal of the Bar Chamber .	-5.4566
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs of class A after testing traces of cocaine in his hair , letters , and credit cards .	-4.1974
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorized information on the arrest of two men on the behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.6341
All four suspects were monitored by the police in the context of a major investigative procedure for the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire , and West Yorkshire .	-3.3908
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police secured the value of <unk> 1.5 million in household research , Heroin and cocaine , and <unk> 200,000 in cash .	-5.5101
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug dependence could become a republic .	-3.4547
Today , Ditta , who works for the Forbes Solicitors Office in Blackburn , was found and condemned by the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstructing justice .	-4.3788
He granted cocaine ownership during a previous survey .	-3.3141
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in her investigations against Scarborough that it had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.1428
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw Ditta ’ s house , where the drugs were purely 60 % in a black golf shoe placed under the trash tones of the lawyer .	-6.4418
Shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough was calling regularly with Ditta , who was in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park during dinner .	-5.4364
The lawyer returned home , picking up the drugs and then exchanging nine messages between the two .	-3.4048
Prior to court , it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after being discovered in class A ’ s hair , wallet , and credit cards for tests .	-9.9220
Ditta was arrested later , but dismissed to take cocaine and said that he was talking to the presumed dealer because he was his client , and claimed that she was subjected to a “ lawyer ’ s secret . ”	-5.7396
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and taken away a hair test .	-3.4337
At the police interrogation , he assumed that both his private address and in the workplace he would call him home for legal matters .	-6.1773
It was known before the Court that he had called on important drug-trafficking actors , some of whom had previously represented , to whom important arrests have been given , and informed about what the investigators knew about them .	-11.0971
As prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ A prosecutor should know better than anyone else that you don ’ t break the law . ”	-3.9666
Ditta is accused of misuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has admitted too much to certain clients .	-4.8457
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who provides drugs to his lawyer .	-3.4915
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , for he was the lawyer of these people .	-3.2806
But that went well beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-1.9196
He looked forward to police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-4.3749
Mr Ditta was therefore in disrepute with his profession .	-3.3954
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.2083
Ditta had any misbehavior and claimed : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait for 15 hours , but do that immediately . ”	-5.2684
But after the hearing , superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a prosecutor to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organised criminals . ”	-8.6247
His cocaine dependence led to a desperate compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-4.9869
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence .	-2.1635
Ditta has lost that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-3.6455
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the cocaine and the judiciary , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-5.0889
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that none can escape the arm of the law .	-2.6497
We find you and bring you to court .	-1.5919
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring guilty of conspiracy as heroin , cocaine , and cannabis trade .	-2.4015
Thirty more people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to a total sentence of 153 years for drug offences .	-3.4706
On his website Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , his dream job as a lawyer to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and Equal Opportunities the motivation for his work .	-5.3983
Revolutionary work of church music	-0.5968
At the end of the celebration of its 160-year existence , the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two Gottes services with the " Deutsche Messe " of Franz Schubert .	-4.7391
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which enthusiastically presented the spectators in the spring of this year , the Song Cranz will enrich two Gothic services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the Deutsche Messe von Franz Schubert .	-6.2458
On Saturday 26th October , this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 during the evening exhibition in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday , 27th October , from 10.15 a.m. at the Gothic Service in St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf .	-6.0467
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Messe to celebrate the sacred victim of the fair " , D 872 , is a musical work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of the creation .	-5.5468
The fair is listed in the context of the services of God , as the customer Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-3.6589
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the musical association ’ s Frozen Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi in the organ .	-4.2856
Hasch : skepticism is growing in confidence .	-3.3260
The 2015 Parish Council elections , for example , will change fundamental legacy in Hasch ( SE ) .	-4.2956
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-3.9799
In a joint session on Saturday the bodies of Hasch , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Weltscheich prepared for change .	-3.9358
Because the diocese 's fundamental decisions can no longer be changed and it is up to the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.7736
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism toward the new , but hesitate to gain confidence .	-4.9653
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals about the future composition and the size of the parish community , the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seas Committee were made .	-6.7689
On the basis of a presentation , Georg Schmitt ’ s regional deputy presented the new guidelines for naval units in the Erzdiosse Freiburg .	-4.2664
Afterwards , the SE Hasch , as a church parish , will form a public law body that enters the rights and duties of the six individual church parishes up to now .	-6.6780
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation board representing the parish power office .	-4.5476
Each parish should represent at least two elected members , in which six parish teams are formed on the .	-4.1629
Their role in the future will be to promote religious life in the place .	-3.8454
On the question of the finances of the individual parish community , a great deal of talk was needed . was . .	-6.7870
The innovations show that accumulated credit is maintained for purposes in the parish .	-5.1047
Liabilities , on the other hand , go to the community as a whole .	-3.2179
There was great concern , particularly with regard to major planned investments , whose obligation then affects all the horrors .	-6.9352
" Even in the past , investments were made only in projects that could be handled by the individual horses alone " , relative Hasch ’ s parish leader Bruno Prinzbach .	-6.2884
Practical experience with a common body for five parrots , Barbar Ritter , the Chairman of the body in the Soul care unit Schuterwald Neuried .	-5.5457
They had a job done in 2006 , " One will , keep five " and have to realise that it is not so easy .	-6.9736
The bodies of the Hascher naval unit then responded to the questions concerning the future composition and size of the common board and the practical work of the community teams .	-6.1660
The processing will be carried out at further meetings and decided in another joint session of all six bodies next spring .	-5.2842
In the end , Michael Schöner , the parish community from Steinach , presented the new logo of the Soul care unit , which was approved by a large majority .	-5.0193
In Pullendorf , the Strom of Mater	-2.9887
The citizens of Pillendorfs must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-3.1936
As the head of the town ’ s works , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed in front of the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-person student village of the family grew to EUR 70 to 90 per year .	-6.5416
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG envelope from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.7061
This edition will be redefined each year in October by the four operators of the large currents .	-6.3702
These figures indicate the additional costs incurred by the use of energy , which they can charge by means of a lever above the price of electricity .	-11.1932
The Municipal Works of Paullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-3.3597
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company , in its forecasts , even assumed a higher level of implementation , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-4.1942
Now the concrete figures should be calculated before the city 's works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-3.9492
" We are going from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , Bias says , with the number going to be close to the 2 cents .	-5.0217

Sometimes a traffic light is not green .	-2.3115
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is defective .	-3.3963
What to do - go red ?	-2.9816
Has a person waited long enough on a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains Stuttgart 's lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorcycle " .	-4.1497
But the waiting time should be " appropriate " , which could be interpreted differently from case to case .	-6.8178
Becker advises to stay for at least five minutes before starting from a disruption of the light .	-4.0737
However , anyone who continues the journey despite red-light must be aware of the full blame for an accident caused by it .	-5.6607
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and points to a decision of the Supreme Court of Hamm .	-4.3236
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes of duration and was responsible for a negligent red-light infringement .	-4.7035
After all , the light was not defective , but sprang around green little later .	-4.7118
A ban on driving was spared him because of the particular situation - but the penalty was not .	-4.6751
The Municipal Council looks forward to a solid budget	-3.2655
Whenever municipal meetings are concerned with the budget , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-2.6216
The municipal bake in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled , and debts have not known the administration since 2005 .	-5.1483
The 2012 financial year can also be considered a success in this sense .	-3.3771
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts .	-1.8548
As Andrea Rothmund said , the administrative budget , at around EUR 7.6 million , was over EUR 1 million more than planned .	-3.8495
The administrative budget , too , was around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-2.6278
The surplus was mainly due to higher commercial income and the community 's share of income tax .	-3.5515
The asset budget , too , was well above its intended values .	-4.3543
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-1.7772
" This is essentially due to the higher administrative budget allocation , " said Rothmund .	-4.1284
Since , in the 2012 financial year , less investment has been made than planned , the setback has also been higher .	-5.0148
Overall , the overall reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-3.6343
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work .	-2.5375
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeves , " he praised with regard to the accounts .	-4.9713
He and the councils were keen to see the good figures .	-2.4195
It may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures could soon be costly to citizens .	-3.2401
The good financial situation has allowed the community to refrain from high stakes in the past .	-3.1338
However , according to the Gerster , subsidies have often been cut from the country .	-5.9477
There are conditions for these grants from various balance-sheet schemes .	-3.8241
For example , cities and communities applying for grants must provide certain levies .	-4.2522
" We must look at the subject of stipulations , because in the years to come , investment that we would like to have grants for " is being announced in this connection .	-7.3957
Nagold : Hugo shipyards in chorus for 60 years	-2.6435

The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures designed to strengthen national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Western Gate Shopping Centre in September .	-3.9553

UN announces New Goals to Combat Poverty	-2.9592
The United Nations is now starting to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty .	-4.0460
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing forward “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals that will expire in 2015 .	-4.0005
They have been included in the final draft document to be adopted at the summit by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-3.1539
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon , at the evening , said that the time had come to “ reflect beyond national interests . ”	-3.8998
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.5710
“ These goals will be built on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the 2015 Development Framework .	-2.8605
I will spare no efforts to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to realise our vision of the sustainable development goals that are based on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.6151
Although SG Achim / Bathing has been without victory for four days , Handball Oberligists continue to have good mood .	-4.3845
Trainer Tomasz Malmon has no doubt about this .	-2.8393
All are still fully motivated by the case .	-4.9806

Even though the Third Party Reserve of Fredenbeck has not currently snatched trees , Malmon is warning the pointing .	-6.0039
I have training many players myself in A-Youth .	-3.3066

" In addition , we have to wait to see if there is further reinforcement from the first one , " clarifies the SG-Coach .	-6.0274
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team needs to increase compared to the previous performances .	-5.1152

Mozambique ’ s security concerns are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-3.4781
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and the first president of Mozambique to agree to a rare public demonstration of peace calls .	-7.8510
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , CEO of an investment company .	-1.9494
For fear of the future of the country , it has converted its business clothing against a t-shirt with the label “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd at the capital ’ s independence square on Thursday .	-6.1068
For two weeks , there have been reports of intergovernmental and renamo clashes almost daily , among the worst fears since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-4.5879
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by White ruled Rhodes , and later South Africa ’ s apart-style government , in an effort to destabilise the country ’ s independent government .	-8.5842
Following the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.7455
Analysts believe that it is unlikely that the country is falling back into a full-scale conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-4.0657
The stakes for the fast-growing economy are high , because the discovery of huge reserves of gas from the coast and coal deposits in the north-west could bring in investments of more than $ 50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Italy and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-6.0179
The ruling Frelimo Party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-2.1576
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province on 17 October , a traditional stronghold of Renamos .	-2.5286
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated , attacked as a government force of Renamo bases , attempting to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group ’ s leader , Renamos Spaker explained to the Financial Times .	-6.1287
The government blames Renamo for the clashes , and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-8.0152
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-2.4526
Against AFP , the French news agency , on Wednesday , he said that Dhlakama sees himself as “ losers , ” who wants to use “ all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.2615
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.2225
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted by the words that Renamo was giving up the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.3589
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement .	-2.8855
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously , ” Mazanga said .	-1.5082
Previous talks between the parties contributed little to settling the tensions which were fired by a number of clashes this year .	-4.2664
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who gather the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at Open University and Mozambique Expert .	-4.3656
None of them are well in the negotiation and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-3.0280
Renamo , pushing for electoral reforms , has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.5516
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.4041
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt to force a powerful movement to gain concessions and financial concessions from the government .	-3.4058
Renamo ’ s electoral success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former renamo member , is likely to improve in the elections .	-3.9466
Mazanga argues that Guebuza – whose resignation , when its second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.5450
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.8882
The capacity of Renamo is unclear , but it has made unease attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south connections .	-4.2063
Most of the prefects took place in Sofala province , which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port that uses mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-6.0406
In June , Rio stopped using the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-6.7602
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat . the . was , , and . , , , , , ,	-6.6736
Renamo “ wanted to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.7267
Instability has increased the frustration of the government , says Fernando Lima , Head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already been concerned about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of kidnapping .	-4.7216
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.0885
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.2784
“ No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-2.7888
Children should be given myths and legends as “ exemplars for life , ” says an author .	-3.0666
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal power has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-2.3750
Many myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught to schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of older works .	-4.3914
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-2.1881
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years .	-1.8058
He added that , for authors and teachers who were “ overly didactic , ” children would “ completely disappear ” , because in entertaining stories , messages would be “ underflowing . ”	-4.6528
Crossley Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon , and the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , declared : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-5.4783
Perhaps the greatest difference between a adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to express hope .	-3.2732
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.2296
It must be portrayed underneath , by which history is manifested and not explained .	-5.1582
This is the old story of drawing instead of telling .	-2.3669

The Court is blocking the NYPD ’ s decision on the NyPD ’ s Stop and Frisk Directive	-4.0191
On Thursday , a federal court blocked a judge ’ s order calling for changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program ( “ Continue and Search ” ) of the New York Police Department , and dismissed the judge from the case .	-5.1191
The 2nd US Appeal Court declared that judge Shira Scheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until the city ’ s appeal was decided .	-4.3312
The judge had judged in August that the city contravened the Constitution with the manner in which the program for holding and requesting people was implemented .	-4.4066
The city appealed against its assessment and remedial measures , including the decision to set up a supervisory body to help the police amend their directive and the appropriate training programme .	-4.4701
On Tuesday , the appeal court heard the arguments for suspension .	-1.9339
The appeal report stated that the judge must be disconnected from the case , because it violated the code of conduct for US judges by specifying that a judge should avoid the appearance of Party ; this was partly due to a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the criticism of the Court .	-5.5830
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeting black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk programme .	-4.5770
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot program with cameras placed on the body in districts where most controls were carried out .	-5.0448
In August , New York declared himself willing to end the practice of retaining the names and addresses of people who were released after police control .	-4.5822
Oral negotiations on the vocation of the city are planned after 14 March 2014 .	-3.1653
The Stop-and-Frisk tactic has been criticised by a number of proponents of civil rights .	-2.9148
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades , but the number of records recorded during the term of the part-time Mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-5.4439
In 2004 , complaints were submitted by four men , all minorities , who became a collective action .	-4.4420
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk program say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trusted and more effective police force , and influence the way other police presidencies are using the system .	-5.9330
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the mural of the police , but not criminality ; nor would they wasted money and would not solve the wider problem of a police force which , after the removal of thousands of jobs in the last decade , has been under pressure .	-10.0995
The judge pointed out that she did not end the Stop-and-Frisk practice , which was constitutional , but only reform the way in which the NYPD would implement controls .	-4.7308

Coulson used telephone hacking to verify a tip .	-2.8530
The former News of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly “ telephony hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” when attempting to confirm a false tip about an affair of the then Interior Minister Charles Clarke .	-5.7921
Prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared a false rumor to the Old Bailey court in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive Special Adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.9121
The newspaper instructed the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voicemails , and followed it , but Coulson also called it and left news , as the court learned .	-4.1984
“ According to the prosecutor , Coulson , who is now the editor of the notW , no one who stands before the housing of people and hopes to invade them fresh action , but one who likes to confront people with a history to see their reaction , ” said Edis .	-5.7296
He said that NotW uses three procedures to research stories in an investigative manner : telephone hacking , monitoring and confrontation .	-4.0474
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-3.1276
Obviously , he knows of the second , the supervision , otherwise it cannot be .	-6.2583
What is the first ?	-1.3644
Does he know about the telephone hacking message ?	-2.3917
He challenged that , but we say , “ and whether he knew it . ”	-3.2615
Rumours about an affair of Clarke were first picked up by the feature editorial of NotW , when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was told : “ Do not waste your time , she ’ s coupled with Charles . ”	-4.4725
A band of voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires 's apartment .	-3.0266
The intermediaries also found entries on the computer of the detective , on which Pawlby and her sister were saved as “ projects . ”	-3.6170
During the time that the research was conducted , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.3874
Meanwhile , former chief carrier Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movements of Pawlby .	-3.0732
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voice mail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to speak to Charles . ”	-3.9580
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-3.7508
The stories heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett confronted a married woman for an affair when he was lied to Rebekah Brooks , who was married to the other day .	-9.0588
Coulson and Brooks argue that they had leaked to others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .	-4.7211
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking .	-2.2543

" We want to involve the residents early in the planning process " , Mayor Jens Häußler opened the Civic Information Centre for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-6.2450
Around 80 attendees came to the community to explain the planned measures , to ask questions , to express concerns and to introduce ideas .	-5.7077
The last decision was made by the Members of the Council .	-4.0707
The flood , which hit pain unprepared on 15 May 2009 , had been a radical event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , so peasants .	-5.3731
A survey of the river area was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in memory .	-5.8483
" Protection of as many land as possible is the goal " , so peasants .	-3.8268
The planning of protection against a according to German weather service is statistically established every 100 years of expected floods .	-4.8686
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percentage supplement .	-1.9499
This is called " HQ 100a climate " in specialists .	-4.6458
The water masses , which had caused considerable damage in 2009 , corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood .	-3.5072
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement " , so masters .	-3.6950
In order to protect HQ 100a climate , around EUR 4 million must be invested in remedies , with the municipality expecting about 70 % of national subsidies .	-6.4300
But it has often been pointed out that support only exists if an overall approach is implemented .	-5.1563
This requires the community to participate in the citizens .	-4.2695
An expensive planning and authorisation procedure must be completed .	-1.8638
In the best case , 2016 can start implementation .	-2.2321
Among other things , the concept of protection , which was already presented in the Council of Municipalities last week ( we reported ) local measures in the flow of the Irm river from the tribal Valley .	-5.9811
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to bring in their concerns .	-2.4479
Amongst other things , there has been a question of why no more dams and basins were planned to protect the place .	-4.6354
Gregor Kühn , specialist planner of the Deputy Engineer Forest and Corbe of Hills , who presented the concept , stressed that it needed the interaction of all the measures put forward in order to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-6.6316
The most economical solution is Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-3.4822
Unmutated was the case with the proponents of the ancient origin , who , even in normal cracks , have repeatedly suffered from overloading the canal network .	-10.3323
The problem is well known about the administration and the first measures have been taken .	-3.4718
However , more often than not , the directives on canal systems were different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed up .	-5.1675
The municipality must be obliged to interpret the Channel Network in such a way that two to three years of rainfall could be offset .	-5.0138

The police immediately blocked the road completely , but had little to say about the accident .	-3.1701
However , there are several testimonies that should be evaluated first .	-3.1842
It is clear that the 19 years old Lenkerin of a VW Golf in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came to her with his Hyundai .	-4.7796
Both of these vehicles collided together , with the woman so hard adhering to the fact that the fire was needed just half an hour to get rid of the vehicle wreck .	-7.5910

In September , James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted that the US did not use any means of foreign espionage to steal “ the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms to expand their international competitiveness or profit . ”	-6.1507

CDC publish allergies for schools	-2.4296
On Wednesday , Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a set of guidelines for the treatment of children ’ s food allergies in schools .	-3.4089
These are the first such directives that the US Government has issued , as the number of school-age children with food allergies is increasing .	-4.2035
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.6444
The spread of food allergies among children , according to the CDC , increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.1394
The guidelines contain information for schools to give teachers and employees a awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions .	-4.4430

Parents of intersexual children can vote “ Gender Incorrect ”	-2.8439
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with unambiguous genes .	-3.6031
newborns are no longer assigned to rigorous male or female . are . are , , , , , , , ,	-4.8109
Under the new law , parents must no longer explain a sex to such children , but can specify “ untrue ” or “ not fixed ” on birth certificate .	-5.2009
The aim of the law is to take the pressure of parents , so that they do not have to take overhaul decisions in relation to operations for gender allocation for newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-6.5765
According to BBC , an intersexual person said : “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”	-2.8099
I maintain the skirt that has been created by doctors and I remain full of scars .	-5.6087
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year has neither a boy nor a girl .	-2.8444
They belong to the intersexual group , a group that falls under the diagnosis of “ sex differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a set concept for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( eggs or hodes ) or unusually developed genitals .	-5.9201
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.6340
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US suggest that one should use the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding , if at all , for an operation .	-6.2915
The New York Psychologist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sound after a good thing . ”	-4.5481
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.1057
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but that does not apply to most children , ” he said .	-2.5416
You can do a gender allocation without an operation and then wait for your identity to develop .	-3.7572
Scientific data about how a child develops its gender identity is not very accurate .	-2.9843
No one knows why that is happening .	-1.8774
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-0.9994
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexuals or transgenders , because their status is not gender but from their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-5.5080
These qualities were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscles , thoughts , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or in chromosomes and hormones .	-5.6373
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination that is subject to intersexual and transgenic people in professional life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-4.7520
Young people who are not in harmony with the gender image now have a special camp .	-5.4177
Meanwhile , in Australia and Nepal , it is possible for adults to specify male , female , or “ third gender ” on official documents .	-3.1923

In 2011 , dozens of French MEPs of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that the “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.9954
The US Catholic Online has also spoken out against German law , on the grounds that “ If the world is broken into a new state where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we twist two more pillars of civilisation . ”	-11.6647
The mother of a newborn born born from Maryland explained to Baby Zone , who would be better off giving babies a sex at birth .	-7.8133
“ The parent ’ s life is stressful enough even without further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the child ’ s sex , ” she said the parent ’ s website .	-4.6018
Children need stability and security .	-0.5313
Historically , children born both male and female sexes were referred to as hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .	-3.8513
Ten years ago , medicine viewed gender as something that could be eradicated and then rebuilt .	-3.1794
But , in the meantime , the ethical foundations of an operation are questioned , having become aware of the complexity of gender identity , and doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels when it comes to growing up with the sex they .	-5.4343
“ In the mid-twentieth century , it was called a psychiatric emergency , ” Drescher said .	-3.0052
If such a child was born , it was not called the psychiatrist , but the surgeons .	-2.3701
The ruling theory about treating children with unambiguous genitals dates back to Dr. John Money from John Hopkins University , who argued that gender is formable .	-4.1414
He shaped the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental impacts – such as parents ’ education – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , thus shaping a person ’ s view as male or female .	-5.6186
But , in a case known as “ John / Joan , ” since 1966 , his theories were controversial .	-3.5271
He cried the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a boy had been maimed , to kill the child completely , and also to remove his hopes , and then to take him as a girl .	-9.3934
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , which he was not , ” Drescher .	-5.3275
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to male sex and married a woman .	-6.4118
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-1.6036
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-1.7846
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the Internet admission , survivors of these gender operations have come to the public , who are “ unhappy with the result . ”	-4.6719
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36 years old author from Montana , born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-3.3492
The doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitor or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-3.9786
So his external organ and dwellings were removed just after the birth of 1976 surgical , and he was brought up as girls .	-5.2865
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.1908
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com .	-1.3700
I was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.5493
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-2.1823
But since he was depressed and knew that something did not agree , he demanded his medical acts .	-3.4264
What he found out was shocking .	-0.8440
I was sterilised at my birth – and nobody ever told me that .	-1.9515
Bruce was born with a DSD that could not produce enough testosterone for the development of the genitals of his .	-4.0750
After experiencing the truth , he returned to male identity , received testosterone injections and allowed himself to be removed .	-4.7997
The operation has made it infertile .	-1.7415
Today , he struggles for other people in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal .	-3.8827
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , CEO of the California legal group Advocates for Inated Choice , ensures that the German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatization . ”	-4.9920
“ Many activists worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make rapid decisions and to make the child “ unfixed ” , she explained .	-5.2045
We fear that this will benefit intervention .	-2.7081
We think it would be better to have male or female sex and wait .	-3.4759
We do not yet know how the law will impact , so we can only speculate .	-2.3457
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognise as the third gender . ”	-3.3414
“ Adults should be able to take their own decisions on their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.8011
The German law relates to the allocation of birth . on on . are on . on on on	-4.9529
This is not a battle for which small children should be forced at this time .	-3.4326
When they grow up , they can decide their own bodies .	-2.5535
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a brutal logist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supported hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law “ powerful ” both parents and children .	-4.8219
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD named complete androgenic resistance .	-2.8673
Katie offers female characteristics due to the prescription defect of target cells for testosterone .	-5.5085
She has a vagina , not a Uterus and no eggs .	-2.8920
Katie 29 is married today ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a member of the Psychiatry of Children .	-3.5192
It is infertile , but hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-3.2608
“ The law gives parents space , which does not require them to take overwhelming decisions , ” said Baratz .	-3.7620
It gives them the time to do different tests and to clarify things and gives them time to write them “ male ” or “ female ” .	-5.2900
That is all right – it attracts the child and loves it .	-4.3528
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the parent ’ s happiness .	-2.9390
And you don 't have to do an operation that can 't be undone anymore .	-4.7679
“ This includes children in the decision , eliminating the fear that parents are displacing because they believe they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.3062
Ultimately , the child decides on gender , which is better suited to it – and that is wonderful .	-3.2717
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-2.4029

" You hopefully have no fear of spinning ? " , Waltraud Ries asks and shows a good spider on the door .	-4.7692
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.0613
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.5110
However , the reason is not a spinning phobia , but the concern of not being able to cope with the many steps of the house and of the apartment at age is explained .	-7.5697
In addition , since a menismus operation , the Mittelzinger has had to experience on his own body what it means to move to Stockwerk with handicap .	-7.6619
Recently , a book of her appeared on the subject of ' happiness living in age - what form of living is the best for me ? ' .	-7.4474
'Our home is the best example of what does not work at all at age ' starts to tell them .	-4.8241
When she moved to Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-3.5975
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks otherwise .	-2.4862
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who are dealing with the subject of age .	-4.0819
Most people are out of the question as long as it goes .	-4.0536
Old are always just the others , " she says smile .	-2.9496

And : ' without good knowledge of the language of the country , you can also combine Dolce Vita , ' gives you the written authors to leave .	-7.2764
Among their models are classical care models , alternative forms of housing or the often quoted pension WG .	-3.7684
At the age , everyone has their tickets and corners .	-3.7766
" For me , such a community would be nothing , " says it with an eye bull .	-5.2076
Not even a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .	-2.5922
" At age you just need the space for withdrawal , " Ries .	-5.8285
The fact that a community of senior residents can still function is that the bookauthors do not want to exclude it .	-6.0999
This should then be done differently from the classical student WG .	-3.5524
And sometimes you just want his rest , " she believes .	-3.0324
It is not alone , at least in the capital of the country .	-3.1258

Your department advises people around the subject of ' getting older ' .	-3.8257
That is why older people would often accept inconvenience and limitations , only to be able to stay in their familiar environment , which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-5.7586
There are a lot of possibilities today for making the house or apartment accessible .	-5.3443
Ries recommends all those who are concerned with the age-oriented rebuilding of their house or apartment to get detailed information and not to entrust the first handicraft .	-7.3921
Today there are also specialists for age-oriented reconstruction .	-2.4660
Even in the rental flat this should be realized one or another , and if it is only the toiletries increase , the interior designs will clarify .	-6.7766
But it is not always possible to reconstruct the existing apartment for ages and thus for barrier-free , even if it is still so beautiful .	-5.9807
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-2.0762
A staircase lift could be installed inside the apartment , which would also be paved with stairs , but this would be a much greater obstacle .	-6.1868

America wants Snowden to keep on prosecuting .	-3.2976
The US did not change its stance on the former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.4622
He will continue to be accused of having provided secret information without permission .	-3.2170
Thus , he would have to face criminal proceedings in the US , said the spokesman of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-3.9773
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this either .	-3.0103
Prior to that , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbeli called on the US not to continue threatening him with punishment .	-5.1145
Psaki stressed that the statements made by a parliamentarian in Strölle were those of a German Member of parliament rather than those of a German government .	-6.8380
Edward Snowden 's intelligence cover is basically ready to talk to German authorities .	-4.9777
First of all , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-3.0409
This made it clear to the former NSA staff sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by the Greens politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and passed on to the Federal Government , Bundestag and General Prosecutor .	-6.0641
The letter follows : after a phrase spreading Ströbeli :	-4.3272
The Contents	-2.6009
I have been asked to write to you on your investigation of mass surveillance .	-2.7479
I mean Edward Joseph Snowden and I was previously engaged in a contract or in a direct position as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-5.5528
In my work in these institutions , I witnessed the systematic breach of the law of my government , which prompted me to take action on a moral basis .	-8.6302
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and persistent army that forced me to leave my family and my home country .	-4.4285
I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum , which the Russian Federation grants me under international law .	-3.2571
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.0995
Citizens all over the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations to a system of all-embracing surveillance that nobody is accountable as a service to the public .	-8.4801
These espionage revelations produced many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuses of public trust .	-6.8585
The benefits to society from these acquired findings are becoming clearer and , at the same time , the risks that may be purchased have been significantly reduced .	-4.6588
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government still treats dissent as a fiery , seeking to criminalise and prosecute political expression .	-5.5855
However , speaking the truth is not a crime .	-2.0581
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will adopt this disastrous position .	-2.9698
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to take appropriate and lawful part in the responsible investigation of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.2615
I look forward to hearing you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and I thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that we all protect .	-4.5846

It is still not clear how the new owner wants to use the former nursery .	-2.5294

Report : Obama campaign considered replacing Biden by Hillary Clinton	-2.3022
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign , the New York Times .	-2.7311
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-2.9899
The Times is a copy of the book that will appear soon , and on Thursday night , she reported that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ large group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to see whether Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election would be better if he had fallen into bonds .	-7.4910
According to Jonathan Martin , the national correspondent of the Times , the book thoroughly recognises the history of the efforts of leading officials in the campaign and the White House to measure , in particular , the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Dley , the effect of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-Presidents .	-5.9183
The potential change was a strictly secrecy in the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.6441
Only half the President ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , the former Obama campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former White House leader , David Axelrod , and David Pluffe – knew about the proposed change .	-4.5842
In “ Double Down , ” Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids despite their “ close , personal relationship , ” before opposing such a chess , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-6.7298
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing ties with Clinton .	-4.2043
“ I mentioned a whole series of things that one should consider , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine .	-3.6018
It must be remembered that the President at the time had terrible poll values , so we thought : ‘ To God ’ s will , what are we doing ? ’	-4.7743
While Daley described the investigations as “ commendable care , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the re-election campaign , a considerable effort has been made to find out whether such a train pays for the ballot box .	-6.2953
“ In campaigns , not spending so much money on surveys and focus groups unless one really thinks about something , ” Martin explained to AC360 .	-3.4073
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking of an exchange .	-2.1569
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his boss had known about the potential change .	-3.0212
While Daley explained that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of ” the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew of it .	-4.3882
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether political songs had reached Obama ’ s desk .	-3.9706
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama knew nothing of the investigations into whether to leave bids in the elections .	-4.7567
“ Perhaps , ” Martin replied .	-2.3242
What happens on the way to my e-mail ?	-2.4532
E-mail actually means electronic letter .	-1.9853
Was the design of the Internet service E-Mail technically implemented the mail secret as did the conventional post ?	-4.6461
The concept of early Internet services focused on making communication possible .	-2.5426
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been considered to create a stable foundation for a prolonged exchange of letters .	-4.9748
Therefore , a traditional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter .	-3.1694
If User " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " , are the computers of the two directly connected ?	-8.8190
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna will send you the mail to your service provider in the first step .	-4.4697
For example , if you have a Gmail account , the Google would be .	-2.2584
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni .	-2.8717
On the track , you can run the mail over a number of other servers on the Internet .	-4.1332
Bennie can then call the content at its provider .	-3.3062
Will conventional emails be read through the network on their way ?	-2.4440
Most mail is read by software robots on the move .	-1.9869
On the sender 's provider , it is usually checked if the mail contains a malfunction as an attachment .	-5.2864
A virus check is also made on the receiver systems .	-2.8570
In addition , the providers check if this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least removed in a spam folder .	-9.2830
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.4940
For systems such as GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-4.2294
When Anna and Benni communicate via Gmail on their coming holiday trips , Google can make links to holiday offers .	-5.4184
Also unknown people can check e-mails ?	-2.9811
The likelihood that unauthorized persons can read a mail is extremely small .	-3.6140
In theory , however , that is possible .	-1.7803
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.0596
Criminal law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails .	-6.5222
Possible illegal delays are to be undertaken .	-3.5658
Is it possible to protect emails against co-reading ?	-2.6011
With a encryption based on the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against fellow reading .	-3.7203
With high technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata to an email communication so that it is not even easy to detect who communicated with whom .	-4.4451
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.5186
Yahoo and Google , according to a survey by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , play only a minor role in the postmainly used for .	-6.7190
While the Yahoo-Mail shares had recently fallen , Google ’ s GMail was able to reveal .	-5.7392
Mother in Forest Hardness and Pensions	-4.7816
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.4983
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and caregivers .	-2.7550
In order to be able to collect further pensions and caregivers , a 67-year-old Wolfsburger burhis dead mother after from in the . the police were , , , , , , and . . , , , ,	-8.2230
At first , he was concealing the death of the 89-year-old people , and he had taken the money for more than a year and a half .	-5.7831
Now the 67-year-old is due to fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-3.2102
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-1.9742
The man was suspected in May : At that time , no longer needed medicines for the nutritious mother .	-5.6078
Pensioners told pensioners that their mother went to Spain .	-2.7155
Because the officials made this odd , they continued to investigate .	-4.1935
It came to light that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that they had recently cared for it .	-5.7858
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-1.6498
Police said there was no evidence of capital crime .	-3.4891
Are you looking for ice cream light in the dark ?	-7.8701
A British entrepreneur has developed the first luminous ice in the darkness – with the help of gaps .	-4.2455
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of marine animals and made it a bright blackmail .	-4.9181
The idea came from him , having read a nasty research and persuading Chinese scientists to produce the shining protein artificially .	-7.9366
The ice cream responds to consumption with the tongue , thereby increasing the pH value in protein and triggering light .	-3.5120
According to Chris , the ice reacting to the heat in the mouth and light – so the more one leaks , the lighter it becomes .	-5.8421
Charlie , founder of the “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” ice cream company , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-4.1752
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.0667
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value and the ice increases .	-2.3225
We have tested it over recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to the market from Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-4.8600
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the quality luminaire is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.6915
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.1454
But it is delicious for that .	-2.2407
Charlie ’ s experimental company , headquartered in Bristol , is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-3.4844
But his latest creation is to be made even more ambitious .	-2.3585
He said , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.0251
This is impossible in itself because of the breakdown of light caused by the ice crystals that make up the ice cream , but I suspect we find a way of creating it .	-5.7394
The ice cream uses the fluorescent qualities of a skill made by Chinese scientists .	-3.3562
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association , after six days of play .	-4.2050
For the team of Ingo Ehlers , it will come tomorrow to the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-5.3604
The season begins again for us with this game .	-2.8201
" I hope that we finally have our head free , " Ehler is behaving optimistic .	-4.1215
He finally got his complete cader , except for the durable violated Hendrik Blohme .	-4.0428
Davern also relies on games of speed .	-4.4110
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.1380
But above all we need to increase the cover , which has left everything but a sure impression .	-4.6607
Daverden Coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first season victory against North Horn .	-5.1796
The game was of course a house number .	-1.6967
But that is why we are not the favorite yet , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-4.0520
However , Panitz now wants to think in Morsum to start a series .	-3.8792
There is no Jan-Malte Jodat .	-3.1569
For this , the A-Youth Joost Windßßßßßßßßß , who is active with double play rights with the HC Bremen youngsters , celebrates his seasonal debut .	-6.0585
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.7402
Shall 2013 : In Numbers	-2.9546
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.3198
My sister and I have been allowed to eat sweets late and suffer for our neighbourhood .	-4.1217
Today I have become more a Halloween muffle .	-3.9723
In the last two years I have not been willing to distribute from my home from sweetness , and I am sure I will not do it this year .	-5.8241
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep for halloons .	-3.1876
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion in sweetness , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Dealers ’ Association ( NRF ) .	-4.9902
One thing that I look forward to every halloon is the trend values .	-4.8432
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , the NRF .	-2.0915
This year , enchanting unlived objects are the last cry .	-4.6344
Women no longer need to hurt themselves in sexy clothing , they can now also embody tempting food such as pizza , hamburger or carottes .	-4.9372
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft Punk Space Area will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-4.7519
According to Google , most common costumes zombies , Batman , pirates and witches are .	-2.7597
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.6029
Last year we beaten our dogs and were not alone with my surprise .	-3.3726
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on their pets ’ costumes , the NRF .	-2.4727
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-1.9290
We are not pacifist about the scourge .	-4.1045
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.3444
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates , lutches , bonbons and rubber bears .	-3.8957
So good news for the US Department of Commerce ’ s 41 million people who move through the quarter with the saying “ Süßes or Saures . ”	-5.2251
Indeed , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloods and , let us not imagine , eat .	-3.8868
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar sweet Candy Corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms are sold around hallowees , according to the National Association of Concrete Producers .	-5.3327
These are about nine billion maintainers .	-2.4643
It is a puzzle that I could not solve yet .	-4.3136
Nothing belongs more to hallowees than houses in which it spurts .	-4.5822
They have great names like “ Behind the Walls Terror ” , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.6340
There are , indeed , 1,200 officially recognized jumps in the United States that generate $ 500 million , such as America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photographs on which you are pinking in your trousers and then put your friends on Facebook , where you will not get rid of them again , and then leave a commentary like “ nice face print ” .	-8.9007
But let us finally get to the news .	-3.5626
Charlie Brown trusted us with the Great Curse when we were children , and the cutting of a pumpkin is like the crushing of the Christmas tree – something that we made from small .	-6.1336
Fortunately , the “ baby in the shortest ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us have grown up with coping with the shorts and not sitting in them .	-4.9433
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on shortbikes , the US Census Bureau .	-4.3934
The shorts that were slowly rotted in front of the garden probably come from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of tiny were harvested this year .	-5.5435
If you want to put it right , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut some hills from their 921 kilo heavy shorts .	-5.7794
Flace-fire in Helmbright : Revolutionary forces Mount Sheets	-5.9579
The fire service had to leave the late Thursday evening in Helmbright .	-5.2288
A three-family house in the district of Hof begins the night for Friday .	-3.5023
The rescue forces have a stolen body from the house .	-3.8611
Savings have found a cured body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbright .	-4.6856
Whether it was a resident would be unclear , as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said .	-3.2406
It was burnt on the ground floor of the house at the late Thursday evening .	-10.4943
When the fire fighter hit , the flames started to slip from a window .	-4.1192
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room .	-2.6433
This and another room burned out completely .	-2.5219
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.2460
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police continued to declar.	-3.1678
The building was not inhabitable for the time being .	-3.7396
The exact cause of the fire was not clear .	-1.9169
Germany ’ s largest church has an offensive start to promote the Pastor ’ s profession .	-3.4891
The background is a possible lack of parish : the Gospel Lutheran National Church Hannover expects the number of its currently 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 .	-5.8183
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Gospel press service .	-4.1286
It is attractive to be able to determine the workflow and the day sequence itself .	-4.4927
With Burgeen , the National Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full site to inspire young people for theology studies .	-5.7915
Currently , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology .	-4.9560
Burfia returns this to the process of decommissioning : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud . "	-4.1899
It is the profession of great freedom and diversity .	-1.9192
I am Mr my calendar and I can focus on where it is important .	-3.8226
As a soul , pastors could be very close to people .	-3.2865
They deserved as much as teachers , and they could live well .	-2.1116
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologists would have a safe employer .	-3.1113
This is what will meet the young people of today , who are not just about careers but about a meaningful job .	-5.9991
According to the National Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastores are currently retired per year .	-6.9590
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theological study begin their Vikariat .	-3.2984
In thin populated peripheral areas such as Harz , Emsland , or Wendland , it can be hard to fill jobs in future .	-5.1314
Burgeen wants to organise a tuition for young people and also invite celebrities that have studied theology .	-5.7307
Study of theology provides broad education .	-3.6193
It is even possible to become President of the Federal Republic .	-3.8049
Land Rover Rally Series	-1.0659
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a leisure area .	-4.7738
The options range from enhanced brakes , a service pack with support for Bowler Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-3.8558
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.6378
They are not all experienced racers but people looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world class events .	-3.9687
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA , and we believe that the format opens up new opportunities to see the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare newcomers to the Strapas and the reality of Rally Raid .	-6.2013
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Card – a very entertaining Championship .	-3.9385
In addition , the Defender Challenge has a training and testing day in February and the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.2988
Fire brigade called to save a chicken , which fixed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rocky lead in a quarry .	-6.3980
Cockerspaniel Hündin Ruby was on the way after a smaller road accident .	-4.1348
Three days later , she was discovered by a stroll in the quarry in its unfortunate situation .	-3.7316
Fire defenders diminished on rock walls and rescued the dog from safe death .	-3.8673
The fire station was able to bring a chicken to safety , which was fixed in a rock wall at a 15-metre high juncture .	-6.9492
The nine months old Cockerspaniel Gift Ruby was killed after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days before being rescued on Wednesday .	-5.0048
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 , who belonged to the dog , came to the stone burst Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire , to recover Ruby and to thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-4.6230
They had desperately sought for their missing chicken and made relief available to social networks when they had escaped into the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-6.3951
On Wednesday , about 14 : 15 , a stroll that took its dog , the strolled ruby at the 15-metre high level of stone .	-8.7736
The Cleckheaton Fire Station ’ s technical rescue team took place and rescued Ruby , which was then transported upwards in a dog box .	-4.7946
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ she was in a dangerous situation .	-2.1591
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from above and the ground .	-2.7848
She did not move muscles during her rescue – she was like pig-frozen .	-3.9324
But now it is doing well .	-1.6019
She then drew a few dogs .	-3.4441
That was a rather unusual exercise .	-2.2072
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible .	-1.0551
Peter Lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said , “ Ruby had a giant piece . ”	-2.8892
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.7137
Ruby was brought to the veterinarian , but he did not detect any exhaustion and dehydration .	-3.5627
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire said : “ Attention to rescue was frightening . ”	-3.4231
I could not even believe that it was actually there above .	-6.3940
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-1.5479
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too big and it would have collapsed , it would probably have been crashed .	-4.3899
Firefighters have done a great deal .	-2.6552
It was truly brave that they did .	-2.9125
We are just as grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.7820
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that she would fall down , but she stayed up . ”	-2.8890
The fire fighters were great .	-1.5087
I can hardly believe where it was .	-0.8302
Mick Jagger said he never made Katy Perry reservation when she was 18 .	-5.2216
On an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the Pop star said that she was a Background singer on Jaggers song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-4.9264
Perry explained that she had eaten with the Altrocker at night , and that “ he promised me when I was 18 ” .	-3.4722
She added : “ That has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.1228
In a statement , a representative Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever tried to approach Katy Perry . ”	-4.1092
The representative added : “ Maybe she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.6737
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year .	-2.4957
Her new album " Prism " landed on Anhieb in place 1 this week .	-2.8659
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the choice .	-2.2858
A new day , a new history of terror for independence .	-1.5981
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.1059
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured by barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall .	-3.6065
In fact , the Strathclide proposal highlighted the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , it did not matter in the headlines .	-6.2525
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often lend themselves to their strict rules if it is cheaper for them .	-4.1630
As Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area , continuing disregard for Brussels would be a small concession in return for what the Scots really want .	-5.0113
So no story .	-2.5570
And one that has happened in the years that she is already like a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport control ” entity 40 years ago .	-5.3545
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story .	-3.2829
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance on the European pipeline ?	-3.5023
Why do the London Joch trade against Brussels , especially now ?	-3.4237
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled .	-2.7966
The European project has officially died with the euro crisis .	-2.0709
Parties in the EU are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro on board as a common currency .	-3.3331
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – just founded this year – could cast almost five million votes in the September federal election , thereby effectively exporting free democrats ( the equivalent to British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-5.6926
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-2.1413
But the current economic crisis has turned out to be the turning point .	-3.8412
Because of the strict austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in conjunction with the straitjacket in which the national economy is being forced to remain in the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.3316
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-2.4302
Instead , the Eurosystem has stipulated its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to make that happen .	-4.8241
Without the possibility of local currency devaluation , southern Europe will find itself in the form of a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-4.3189
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred from Berlin .	-2.1422
A deeper European productivity problem lies behind the current economic and monetary problems .	-2.7054
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives ordered by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and quadruple gas compared to the United States .	-4.6311
This is a paralyzed cost disadvantage , as we have seen in Grangemouth .	-3.6908
All the world ’ s wage constraints do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed aside by cheap American shale gas .	-2.3160
As a result , revolt is on the rise , particularly in France , the former leader of the EU .	-3.2921
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris for an eye to Washington .	-4.3029
But Berlin does not need more than a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe up its own economic policy , which is struggling with the struggling French economy .	-5.9660
The result is that Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive retribution , thereby highlighting the ruling socialists in place three .	-4.4542
Front National is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the electoral votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that splitting in the right would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-3.6797
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French ?	-2.1679
It would like to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament .	-2.5443
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very well possible – such a block could for the first time dominate the European Parliament .	-3.9533
This is the point I want to make : in the not-too-distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will meet to abolish the euro .	-3.9355
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of the ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-2.6335
Germany and some of its satellite economies may remain on the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.6963
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering in the United States .	-3.2899
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone will be in Atlantic rain .	-2.0372
Where is Scotland left with all this ?	-2.1798
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-5.7709
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including , say , Berlin and Brussels , what they can get out of .	-2.9872
I suspect Scotland could go quite well in a more relaxed European association if we keep our own currency .	-3.5987
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in an unfederal Europe of nations .	-2.5042
Otherwise we should consider doing so in Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-3.0923
The SNP government in Scotland , notably , is the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and in 2011 won a spectacular majority on the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that Labour finance minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem coalition had to accept .	-5.5967
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence only to be imposed on austerity from Berlin and Brussels .	-3.1368
Early Puberty	-2.1500
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white ages , as investigations show .	-3.5374

Should a mother be worried if their daughter grows breasts and shamehair at the age of seven or eight ?	-3.5049
At the annual conference of the Children ’ s Medicine Association , American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz stated that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-5.0947
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually that is no sign that now comes fast in puberty , ” Kaplowitz explained .	-4.4334
Apparently showing the development , such as growing breasts , shame and axis hair as well as body smell , girls are shown earlier .	-9.0934
Yet there was only a slight shift in the Menaarche ’ s age ( appearance of the first regular blood ) in the last 40 years .	-5.2808
The average age in the United States is 12.5 years , less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.2630
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it will take at least two to three years to the menarch , ” Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early Puberty of Girls : The essential counselor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ” , , , , , and .	-12.7913
Time is the most precise test as the puberty progresses .	-2.3716
It is controversial , which is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early in ” when the growth of the breast is accompanied by an age of eight .	-5.8486
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a child ’ s director can monitor closely .	-3.6448
For faster advances , tests could be shown by an endiconologist to prevent serious problems such as tumor or cysts .	-5.1721
There are methods of treatment to delay early menstruation and defense of another consequence : the premature ageing of bones , which can lead to the ultimate impediment of growth and thus a small body growth in adults .	-6.2515
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and emotional maturity .	-9.9836
Psycho-social aspects are also important .	-2.2039
Kaplowitz is reticent when it comes to medicines , but he admits : “ The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavioural problems and moderate the feelings of girls , unlike their sense of age . ”	-5.7991
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.5396
“ They worry about pregnancy risks or how they handle the hygiene side , ” Kaplowitz said .	-3.5177
“ It was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter was ten days old .	-3.3303
Although there were first signs and we had spoken about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-2.7335
She joined the school and excited her home because she was the first in her pucirc.	-5.1097
There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.0820
But there is no coherent evidence that hormones are causal in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .	-3.6553
Young are getting into the puberty like girls sooner .	-3.6406
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.5257
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 about girls aged six to nine years , who created a connection between fat and entering puberty .	-4.8270
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-1.8092
In this country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age senses .	-2.7489
There are different explanations for this .	-1.4732
Global , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .	-3.0274
Another puzzle : Although boys grow facial and shamboo conditions earlier , the trend to a full-fledged former puberty is not as pronounced as a girl .	-4.9681
Other doctors at the AP conference emphasized the complexity of the subject .	-1.6217
The appearance of acne and shamhair is widespread even among babies and infants .	-3.1361
“ We must be careful to identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.3757
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician how they should speak to their child .	-3.3576
“ This can mean that you have to hold a conversation earlier than expected , ” Kaplowitz calls .	-4.2203
If you remain calm , the child normally reacts well .	-2.8781

Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders over seat width .	-2.5228
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class for long-haul flights , which indicates the tone for a bitter clash at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-5.5121
The dispute revolves around the seating width offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who make the most of the effort of airlines , but this established space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co aircraft .	-6.9902
Airbus has demanded an industry standard this week requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrival Boeing says that airlines should decide .	-4.5460
The debate comes at a time when airplanes are therefore competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft , and record sums are expected at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-6.3478
As the rear part of the aircraft is staged – especially if there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the given economic results that the new “ mini jumbo ” design will deliver .	-5.6559
Boeing claims that its modernised “ 77X ” has a total of 406 people at tourist seats over 17 inches , allowing ten per line .	-6.2602
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-4.3810
Aircraft giants often share bullets with technical details using advertising in the trade press .	-4.1016
Now Airbus is appealing directly to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X will likely be racing with more than 100 orders .	-4.9883
Recently , the company presented an indication that could be the beginning of a new war of advertisements , showing donors an image squeezing three people into a restaurant , and entitled “ Would you accept that ? ”	-6.9291
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats narrower than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus ’ sales chief John Leahy .	-4.4223
With changing nutritional habits , people are getting thick , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.6752
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when Boeing ’ s 747 defined modern long-haul travel , and the end of the century , male average American weight increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to the US Department of Health .	-3.9062
According to US health statistics , the taxis of male average American in the 21st century are 100.8 cm .	-4.5059
Airbus says that its rival is based on a 1950 ’ s seating concept , when the average body amount of fresh “ jet set ” was narrower .	-5.5436
They carried out investigations , Airbus said , showing that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases the sleeping quality by 53 percent .	-4.9675
Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus to the sizes and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines balance between fares and equipment .	-5.2711
The company also explains , according to studies , that the experience in the aircraft depends more than the seat width .	-4.0750
“ There really is a need to give airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains the Kent Craver of Boeing ’ s cabin expert .	-4.8057
They do not want us to dictate to them what they make profitable .	-2.4064
You know your business better than any other .	-1.8847
There is more elbow free for passengers , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can have an impact on sales .	-5.6822
Behind the discussion is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated $ 700 billion for list prices in the coming decades , which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-4.7829
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seating layout is the driving force behind the discussion about the new jets .	-2.7434
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range design than the market leader in this segment , Boeing 77-300ER 3.	-4.1229
The Boeing statements to the results depend partly on the 777X being compared with the original design of nine seats in the 7777 .	-4.3403
Increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per line .	-2.9506
“ Boeing therefore quetches more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Kenniston , head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-5.1804
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins of ten seats per series of existing 777s pointed out that many passengers decided on the tighter arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-4.7715
“ Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert on cabin equipment , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.8136
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a list of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-2.6579
The world 's jet sellers even wear bandwidths to measure the setup at competition .	-6.3963
Even if they offer comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.4519
Airbus offers a ten-seated A350 , but has not yet sold according to its own statement .	-3.4093
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of adaptability for cabins and offered wide seating for some jets .	-4.0394
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard would probably be puppeted , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-5.0510
New anti-nicotine vaccine could kill the fun of smoking .	-2.3048
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil fun with smoking .	-2.4256
A single dose of the vaccine has been able to protect mice for a lifetime from nicotine disease .	-3.5472
Other experiments are needed ahead of human testing , which may take several years to complete , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-3.9491
“ We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccine strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying to stop trying all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine search is stronger than those approaches , ” says Cornell .	-6.2566
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been changed to include genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.3714
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-2.1782
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , so that a smoker does not experience nicotine high .	-3.9125
In trials , vaccinated mice awarded to Nicotine received her normal level of activity .	-4.5405
Mäse , without vaccination , had taken a “ time out , ” the researchers said that the nicotine had reached her brain .	-5.1054
Experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine Industrial Journal .	-2.4868
Early tobacco vaccines failed because they contain antibodies .	-2.6218
The vaccination had to be given so often in order to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.7721
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.6745
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for humans , if absolutely certain , could be handed over to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-5.2283
But it is more likely that smokers would use him to stop .	-1.9567
“ They know that when they start to smoke again , they no longer feel pleasure in smoking because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to dismantle habits , ” he explains .	-6.0198
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that more research was needed .	-2.2668
Tripodi denied having been influenced by Obeid .	-5.1344
Former Labor-Party ministers Joe Tripodi from New South Wales are being investigated by state corruption regulators .	-4.8155
Former NSW ministers denied having amended the Maritime Complacement rules , on request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had hidden investments in three plots of land under state control .	-5.3312
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC / Independent Commission against Corruption ) expanded its investigations on the question of whether Obeid had influenced different Ministers of State to extend leaflets at Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without bidding for their exit in August 2005 .	-6.3387
Now , because of the accusation , Tripodi knew that Obeids had a hidden interest in the property , after Tripodis 's former deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole announced on Thursday that it would .	-6.8814
In years of talks starting in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the package contracts .	-3.9718
The paths were against this and wanted longer maturities .	-4.1156
In 2009 , the Circular Quay leasing contracts , which contributed $ 2.5 million annually to the Obeids , were extended without any public tender .	-6.2371
Tripodi , who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , was originally in favour of public tenders .	-3.4705
But he dismissed having made changes to Obeid ’ s requests , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganisation of government leaflets .	-4.9501
One of the ICAC 's proposed telephone book showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had switched to the port ministry after working under obeity in the Fisheries Authority .	-5.7634
“ Was the issue discussed in these telephone conversations the drawing up of commercial dispensing rules ? ” , Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-5.8756
No , Tripodi responded .	-1.7866
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-2.0479
definitively not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.4265
Israeli fighter aircraft Activate Syria , Official Sources	-3.6502
Israel ’ s hunting aircraft would have attacked a target in Latin Syria ’ s port on Thursday night , confirming a senior government official to Fox News .	-4.4580
The official did not explain what the goal was , but said that it was at least one .	-1.9015
According to Associated Press , the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.8104
At least twice this year , Israel has already made air strikes in Syria on missile supplies .	-2.7193
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ real test . ”	-2.5328
In the context of expanded measures , the government is considering a “ test of realities ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-3.7870
Should the test be introduced , it would be used through a criterion to prevent the use of 457 to occupy unqualified jobs or as the back door for the accumulation of family and friends to Australia .	-5.4605
Today , a government proposal for discussion was published after the former Labor-Party MEP Maxine McKew , who condemned government comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.2307
“ Lautterly declarations like foreigners are supposed to stop “ and , Australia first stop ” are a very unpleasant retreat in times when unions were demanding a protected labour market , ” she said to Australia India Institute today .	-7.0205
Historically , that means that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region interfere with an echo of this historical artifact , I would not be surprised .	-3.6595
The proposal for a debate includes twelve measures which were once considered by former Immigration Minister Chris Bowen .	-3.4427
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was yesterday talking about the smuggling of human beings in Sri Lanka , implemented five of the recommended amendments , which others will consider .	-4.6354
If the “ realities criterion ” is adopted , anyone asking for a visa could be reviewed as to whether “ the application is real in cases where the applicant is transformed or personally linked to the holder or relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-6.5280
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders , since in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers finally abandoned hundreds .	-4.4795
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker may have died in a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island .	-5.4413
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia with him , is served by an adult cousin , who was also on the boat since his father 's death on Wednesday .	-4.7569
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.7235
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 Railway Project for Scotland .	-2.3791
The work of HS2 Ltd is proposed to implement high-speed connections between Scotland and North England already at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.7284
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.4428
Scottish Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.5115
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed connection between London and the West Midlands .	-2.2021
After phases 2 , connections will be made to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.7636
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England of <unk> 32.7 billion and <unk> 42.6 billion .	-3.1662
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has instructed HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel improvements for North England and Scotland .	-4.9218
This includes the possibility of a travel time from eventually three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-4.0335
Baroness Kramer said , “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.3592
We are moving forward with HS2 , because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.4477
Without it we are faced with a capacity crisis in our rail network .	-2.7596
But it is also a matter of linking 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.0109
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.2515
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmicael called for “ unambiguous ” involvement in the HS2 network .	-3.1006
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link has the potential for huge economic benefits for Scotland , while at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power is arguing for rapid rail links across the UK . ”	-4.4380
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow Edinburgh link , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.1863
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and to jointly adopt the next steps .	-3.5751
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft are provisionally in force in Australia	-2.4627
Australia ’ s passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease the rules for such devices .	-4.2092
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their specifications so that passengers can read , watch , or play video during critical flight phases of e-books , if they are in flight mode .	-4.2142
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they are not allowed to read their e-books when starting and landing .	-4.9995
Australia ’ s companies are watching the decision that US airlines must do a great deal of work , but they are not pursuing any immediate plans to amend their rules . US airlines do .	-9.6762
CASA also stated that it would look at the announcement , but emphasized that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply in critical flight phases in Australia .	-3.9831
“ CASA has currently not had any specific rules regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft ” , has been distributed .	-4.9244
The subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines must maintain safety at any time and that passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew .	-4.8115
Virgin has already had talks with the CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and explains that it is open to change but that it needs to be initiated by the legislator .	-5.3964
“ We would welcome a review of the CASA authorisation , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.6080
Qantas explained that it would remain with the current regulations until further notice .	-6.4918
“ Our current guidelines suggest that electronic equipment should not be used when starting and landing , and at the moment we have no plans to change it , ” said the company .	-4.0362
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines .	-1.3131
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.4143
The decision varies depending on the age of the fleet of US companies .	-3.9721
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruptions through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer documentation .	-5.0435
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at all levels ” , the FAA announced .	-5.1077
In rare cases when the viewpoint is bad , the crew will show passengers while landing will disable the equipment .	-5.2272
The group also recommended to dump heavier appliances at startup and landing safely under the headquarters or across the seats .	-5.6206
Before the Revierderby against Schalke , some BVB trailers with light-rockets had ensured for ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena .	-4.9002
Borussia Dortmund then announced severe consequences .	-1.0868
Before the Friday match of the VfB Stuttgart , the World Cup League against the VfB Stuttgart reacted with a - .	-5.3447
It was an uncomfortable acoustic , almost already split , which offered the viewer until just before the advent of the Bundesliga game between the German vice-maker Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park .	-6.1251
Most of the people were listening to their singles .	-6.4320
On the other hand , the South Vengeance , where the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand , initially presented themselves quietly : no songs , no slaughter calls .	-6.2446
The pot of Capo , which otherwise coordinates the attainment , remained unemployed .	-5.2327
And in the front of the gallery there was a big flag flag with a label " Section Stadium Ban " .	-7.5142
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as always the first BVB player to be in the place , broke up shortly .	-5.3765
When his team colleagues followed , there were loud vocals and wealthy shells - but not everywhere .	-4.9514
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern tribunal .	-2.9593
Also that songwriter Norbert Dickel recounted the positive experiences of recent days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , prolonged contract by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide feelings .	-6.0415
It was only five minutes before the capo landed his podium - and until then the rebellion turned out to be in a loud shrine , when the mood discharged the ranks in the stadium .	-9.3373
As always , it was the turn of the South Stadium - and finally it was here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium .	-6.6269
And , at the latest , when the South District presented the loud call " Derbysieger stands on " , everything was as always .	-8.6951
The silence earlier was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-2.5131
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the participating BVB followers had fucked lighting missiles into the spectators and in the place - and hit almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller .	-7.5849
The game was baptized late because of the chaotic scenes .	-5.9929
BVB Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tips of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and you believe Wattke 's words , this was a rather unwise appointment for the fan representatives .	-6.1594
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-movement , " the BVB Boss announced on a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening .	-4.0931
As an instant measure , Watzke signed a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-4.0998
" I have banned this , " he explained .	-2.4723
We cannot abandon zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.1189
In addition , several punishment options have been shown to the Ultras – until Tuesday they have time to choose one .	-5.3919
Otherwise , so Watzke , the BVB will establish a sanction by the end of next week .	-3.4474
" That will be far-reaching , " insured cheek .	-3.6577
It is worth mentioning how the reactions in the South Gulf are then to be .	-6.0539
Pfandhouses boom in Singapore , as the middle-class crisis hit	-3.3215
In a Pfandhaus in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armerif , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters .	-5.5366
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is my whole money in , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.9111
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( about 1,730 euros ) as an administrative assistant and her husband does not make up a monthly income , she explains .	-5.7303
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is so great that ValueMax , where it made its exchange , became the third panel that is listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-5.1138
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan .	-4.8214
Typically , Pfandhouses in Singapore demand an effective 17 % annual interest , which is just over 15.4 % that the United Overseas Bank demands , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center .	-3.9991
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that credit rating or income proof is not required here , which is why loans are faster than banks allow .	-5.8857
As a result , millions of people in the region turn to Pfandhäuser , after families feel the pressure from rising living costs , as well as increasing household and consumer debt .	-4.3931
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans , owing to loose fiscal policies in the developed economies , families with lower and middle-income Pfandhäuser have been searching for the difference in stagnant economies .	-6.8039
This week , the credit rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing fiscal debt , mainly through rising mortgages , was a risk factor in Asian banks ’ borrowing .	-3.8211
Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore , according to the Agency , have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic .	-3.2710
Malaysia is leading the list , with 80 % of GDP , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-2.0987
Economists are also concerned about the high consumer debt in Thailand , which came out of a technical recession this week .	-3.1043
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing shortage of exports and a shortfall in consumer demand .	-3.5879
“ In the end , in the face of rising costs , the mid to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their incomes wherever possible , ” says Song Seng mir , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.9678
Historical peaks in gold prices over the last two years have exacerbated the trend to foster personal objects , as people use the opportunity to turn the family 's jewelry into cash .	-4.8011
Singapore represents about 70 % of the pledged items in the 200 pledges of the Gold State .	-4.5921
People say , “ The price of gold looks good , let us pave the grandmother ’ s gold chain and recover next month . ”	-4.2526
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator , EasyMoney , has seen a 20 % increase in customer growth in recent months in its branches .	-7.2390
Pfandbrief growth is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , would like to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , such as Yeah Lee Ching , CEO of ValueMax .	-4.5620
The company finances this with 60 percent of the $ 66 million of Singapore that it received this week with the stock market in Singapore .	-4.3588
While some lenders were in the crossfire for high interest rates , Yeah says that Pfandhouses were not only mortgaging interest rates other than others , but also not directly raising the debt .	-6.4028
“ Customers alive items they already own , and the liquid of personal values does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.2373
Policies are increasingly socially accepted as short-term , secure financing .	-3.7800
Nor are all those who use parcels in financial difficulties .	-2.6888
Realms from Singapore also come to ValueMax branches to catch gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price .	-5.4905
We produce clients from every social class .	-2.8890

Backup of more than $ 325 million for Tasmanian Health Care	-3.9358
The Australian government insists on tough conditions linked to the bailout package of more than $ 325 million to Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the federal government cannot waste money .	-4.7002
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will “ take immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging island state population , a higher rate of chronic illnesses and system constraints .	-4.4108
Funding for a period of four years was decided by government consultations with the independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-3.6026
“ The government has launched an emergency bailout package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” Plibersek today declared .	-4.7027
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million instant help for election benefits .	-3.3096
Another 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and gray Star treatments , are intended to eliminate residues .	-5.2833
There are also money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better care after stationary stays , professional training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-4.8253
“ This investment is in line with the ideas of clinical staff who have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian healthcare system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-5.3780
The minister insisted on rigorous accountability and accountability for the Tasmanian Government .	-3.1733
The state must retain the current level of financing to get money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where the extra money was spent .	-3.9007
A three-person Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as efficiently and efficiently as possible .	-6.2373
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by genuine reforms that push the public Tasmanian health system toward a more sustainable path . ”	-4.4309
Nevertheless , he commended the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .	-3.4991
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the list of sorts , ” said Wilkie .	-4.0926
According to the federal government , these electoral services will largely be betting the recent cuts .	-3.7839
But the German opposition ’ s health spokesperson , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ plaster solution . ”	-4.3088
“ We are in today ’ s situation because the Labor-State government cut $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.8460
It cannot be that a government travels almost half a billion dollars out of the system , including the Commonwealth of 300 million , and then pretend that the good news is good news .	-5.4872
Dutton called for Plibersek to be guaranteed that not a single dollar of the bailout package will be spent on extra bureaucracy .	-7.1196

Syria has destroyed its possibility of producing chemical weapons , such as a surveillance group .	-3.0389
Syria has destroyed important Chemical Weapons and Gasma Units manufacturing facilities , the global chemicals surveillance group on Thursday , while in the north of the country , serious clashes occurred near one of the sites where suspected poisonous substances are stored .	-7.0803
On Thursday , too , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people were killed soon three years ago since the civil war began .	-3.1458
The announcement of the Organisation for the Ban of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) took place one day before the deadline .	-3.2702
November 1 , which the organization Damascus , based in The Hague , had set up to destroy all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to “ inoperable ” , including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition .	-6.1411
The conclusion of this process , basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at eradicating all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.5664
The destruction of the institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.2516
However , Damascus still has to begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-3.2791
According to assumptions , there are some 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and nerve gas Sarin .	-4.4811
The announcement came at a time when battles took place in the city of Safira on Thursday , experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses , as the Syrian observatory for human rights in the United Kingdom .	-4.7881
The activist group that pursues the number of dead over a network of activists in Syria explained on Thursday that 120.296 people died .	-3.3814
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6.365 children .	-1.8428
On the side of the government , 29.954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.5153
Also among the dead were 2.202 army soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-3.9286
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.0412
This number has not been updated .	-1.2679
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-1.5718
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting against the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of which have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-4.9756
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday but did not mention details .	-2.0446
The battles underscore the danger of chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arms arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a dead civil war .	-8.2826
According to the OPCW , working closely with the United Nations , “ the team is now convinced that it has seen and experienced its destruction all the essential production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-5.3092
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ”	-2.7112
Earlier this week , the inspectors said they had completed the first round of audits and visited 21 of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus .	-3.8878
Because of security concerns , the inspectors were unable to visit two institutions .	-3.1263
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites were “ abandoned , according to Syrian assertions ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme in question were shifted to other types of facilities that were inspired . ”	-6.5156
It was not immediately clear whether the sites in Safira were one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.2128
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved by the Executive Committee of the OPWC next month .	-2.8743
“ I take the hat from the navy and the courage you have shown all when completing the most challenging mission ever performed by that organization , ” explained Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization , in a commentary published by OPCW .	-6.4303
For three years now , the largely Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad ’ s government and its security forces , which include many members of the Alawites , a secession of Shia Islam .	-3.8921
With regard to further developments , the head of the Observatory , Rami Abdurrahman , said that on Wednesday , there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latin America .	-11.2807

Anger about Bali ’ s Bali bombers	-3.1296
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 during the bomb attack in Bali reacted angry at the judgment of the last of the prosecutors who was put before trial , since they believe that Umar Patek should be shot permanently .	-7.4107
Patek , who was on flight for almost ten years as one of the most sought people in Southeast Asia , was condemned yesterday for his role in building springs for the bomb to a punishment of 20 years .	-5.4380

The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for attacks on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.2581
A blame also took place in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Holy Eve in 2000 .	-4.0328
The prosecutor had called for a lifetime sentence , even if it could have applied for the man who , because of his reputation as a chief bomber , is also called a “ demolition man ” .	-6.4663
The decision has woken painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39 years old twin brother Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-swords almost ten years ago .	-5.3799
In fighting with tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-3.4134
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-2.3322
“ You should put him before a shooting comando , ” said Corteen against AAP .	-4.3718

Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-3.2504
In fact , this type should be given the death penalty above all else .	-3.2619
Allowing him to live – no , there is no reason to let him live .	-2.7390
20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds , not much .	-2.7474
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber in court .	-2.6397
He dismissed nearly a decade of arrest , but eventually took up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed the former al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden barely four months later .	-4.7007
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-4.4189
“ He hasn ’ t asked , ” said Corteen .	-2.9767
Until recently , he did not show any faithfulness to how much suffering he had inflicted on other people .	-2.7420
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is celebrated with memorial celebrations in Bali and Australia .	-3.7361
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.1281
Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-1.1139
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not have mobile calls )	-3.3582
From the departure to the landing , passengers can now use their electronic devices to read , work , play , music and watch movies , but do not phone with the mobile , so the new directives issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-6.2327
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.2657
The FAA staff Michael Huerta explained how quickly they would be implemented at a press conference .	-4.5851
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft correspond to the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the aircraft and the rules for appearing devices in accordance with the new rules .	-6.2671
The FAA has already stated that some airlines have already received plans that want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-4.0060
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines .	-1.5282
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could very soon authorise the increased use of electronic devices , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-3.9785
Passengers currently need to disable smartphones , tablets and other devices when the airplane doors are closed .	-2.6629
They may not reboot until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain is given the green light .	-4.5630
When entering the landing flight , passengers will have to shut them off again and they must not reboot before the airplane arrives .	-6.2029
Under the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft were safe against electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use equipment even at launch , landing and rollfield announced the FAA .	-5.2872
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.8105
Laura Gladding , President of the Professional Federation , welcomed the amendments .	-4.2981
“ If the new regime is enforced safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit , ” commented glass .	-4.7313
In all honesty , we are sorry to have to feel better on this issue .	-4.4734
However , Internet connections for surfing , exchange of e-mails , text messages , or downloading data below three kilometres remained banned , the Authority explained .	-4.2802
Passengers are asked to put smart phones , tablets and other aircraft in flight mode .	-3.2619
So no “ Words With Friends , ” the scrabble of similar online game that Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines publicly because he refused to shut off the device while the aircraft was parked at the flying .	-11.6168
And heavy equipment such as laptops must continue to be missed , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-5.4864
Mobile calls during the flight will remain prohibited .	-4.2716
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.6911
FAA may ban certain electronic equipment on start and landing .	-3.1928
Last month , Mark Rosenker said that the National Transportation Safety Board , national transport experts on CBS News , mobile phones are still at risk .	-3.9457
“ Mobile is really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruptions in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt sendemastes , ” said Rosenker .	-5.0925
A Consulting Committee of the Industry set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allowed a broader use of personal electronic devices .	-4.5472
In recent years , the pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-3.3603
Critics like the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid grounds for prohibition .	-2.7785
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the instruments has become omnipresent .	-4.2248
Some studies talk about this , which forgets or ignores the dismantling of the device up to one third of passengers .	-7.5545
In 1966 , the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic devices by air passengers after reports of the disruptions of navigation and communication devices by passengers of UKW radios , which then became the latest technology trend .	-6.2113
New aircraft are far dependent on electric systems as former generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed in such a way and approved by the FAA that they do not make electronic interferences .	-5.0714
Airlines have been serving Wi-Fi for several years now , when flying height is reached .	-4.9204
Flights adapted for Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences .	-4.2942
The overwhelming majority of passenger aircraft should be able to use electronic equipment for greater use under the new guidelines , Huerta said .	-4.7505
Today ’ s electronic devices generally produce far fewer radio radiation than previous generations .	-2.7859
E-Reader , for example , will give up only minimal radiation when translated .	-5.3902
But when downloading or sending data , transfers are more powerful .	-2.1535
Amazon.com. , one of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers . are .	-4.0190
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not find .	-4.8662
Members of the FAA Consulting Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-2.0091
Douglas Kidd said by the Passenger Association of Airline Passengers that he felt that the disruption caused by the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .	-4.2498
Other members of the committee said that there are only few clumsy reports of pilots who are in favour of disrupting aircraft systems by the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-5.8101
However , the Committee recommended that pilots be allowed to arrange for the dismantling of equipment by passengers in the event of an instrument landing with poor visibility .	-6.3933
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a sensible adaptation for travellers who would now have a wide range of technology .	-4.6232
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.9338
Replacing birds saved for air rescue service from North Sea drills .	-4.2649
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , who had been exhausted on a North Sea drill island , was redundant in nature again .	-5.6806
The water threshold was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter , where it was paved by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa .	-4.9304
Colin Seddon , Head of the Centre , said : “ This water ralle was probably a wintry train from northern Europe , held by the strong wind above the North Sea . ”	-4.8854
Apparently the exhausted bird was seeking refuge on the drill island .	-2.6483
He added : “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.8859
In their release , the water pit was once again fit and healthy .	-3.5799
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.0695
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and to define what those who provide prosperity and work in Britain want to change our relations with the EU .	-4.0444
To this end , we commissioned the biggest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.0232
YouGov consulted more than 1,000 executives from the economy , roughly Britain ’ s size , sectors , and regions .	-7.1369
The results of the survey will be surprising .	-1.5106
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while the countries of the EU are stagnating .	-4.0609
They want government side to favor new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil , rather than restraining with the long and demanding process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.3478
In their view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competencies should be returned to Westminster , in their view , on certain legal issues – from the right to product legislation .	-6.3368
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , because , according to companies , the cost of Brussels ’ regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed to this , which is traditionally the most pro-European .	-4.4557
Finally , and probably the most , our survey of economic leaders found that a substantial majority in Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not with politics .	-6.1153
This recognition among companies of all sizes and leading corporations shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change , ” which will bring the rejuvenation of action to Britain .	-5.2970
It is a lot at stake – changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a referendum , at 16 % , a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU .	-5.8345
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating the British conditions for EU membership .	-3.1679
It also shows that companies expect a marked shift in the balance of power to Britain from renegotiation .	-3.2849
A better deal for the British economy is possible , and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone is now moving toward a tighter economic and fiscal union .	-3.7709
The priority must be employment and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-7.9809
Alexei Miller of Gazprom calls Pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new Gaza	-2.8101
The construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects , the Gazprom Board declared .	-3.8169
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : building work on the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said the Chairman of the Executive Board of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-4.0936
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.7068
South Stream intends to provide more variety in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.7280
A dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , would help to raise the risk of conventional routes , as the official said .	-5.6110
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , meant that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “ eliminated forever . ”	-2.1285

Concerning the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused of allegations against Jonathan Lord of sex offences .	-8.7590
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were charged for child sex offences before allegations were made in 2011 against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for child sex abuse .	-4.7081
But at the opening statement to the Commission , YMCA declared that “ the organization never had to do with an incident of sexual abuse of children ” .	-5.4518
Phillip Hare ’ s CEO was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged for child pornography abuses , and another one in which a YMCA Caringbah Hall ’ s sporting teacher was sentenced in 1991 for the abuse of entrusted children .	-6.7400
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the lawyers assisted by the Commission , that he knew of the first case but did not identify the second . , .	-6.8812
He admitted that the YMCA opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the assertion that “ there were external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as being at the forefront of child safety . ”	-5.9167
Evidence before the Commission demonstrates that the YMCA was informed that it received the second highest evaluation of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year .	-4.9114
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the management “ failed from me to the bottom ” and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the guidelines on child safety .	-5.3679
Lord was sentenced to the YMCA for sex offences by twelve boys during his two years of work .	-4.5435
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.2782
Hare contested , however , that YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing the employee from reporting Lords violations of children ’ s safety .	-4.5152
The staff said they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , to attend them privately as babysitting , to sit on his boss , to one said he loved it , and to play children with his mobile phone .	-7.0276
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord was and who had asked for a training on child protection because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child ’ s officer , Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior lords in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimate , and most of the time was very inconvenient . ”	-7.7745
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to refund their superior reporting .	-4.5651
Instead , he said , instead , that her friendship with Lord affected her judgment ability , which is why she did not report it .	-5.2653
Hare explained that he told the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson to draw the organization from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” was “ not about reporting ” by staff , and the Board agreed to it .	-5.5715
Hare said that the decision to urge staff to sign secrecy obligations was made shortly after the accusations were issued , had been taken by the Chief of the Child Services of YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-5.3713
He said that this was to prevent the contamination of the evidence , but that was “ over-hasty ” and poorly implemented .	-4.9292
YMCA NSW was not an organisation for children during the time Jonathan Lord was occupied there between 2009 and 2011 , Professor Stephen Smallbone explained by Griffith University , expert on sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-4.6596
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , verification , elaboration , training , and supervision of employees .	-3.4642
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.8507
Tony Blair said that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely .	-3.2197
In an interview this evening on the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.4319
Since resigning in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided making a statement on British politics , and his comments have mostly been confined to foreign policy and its role as the Quartet of the Middle East peacekeepers .	-5.3386
Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London in the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office : “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that that will happen , so ... ”	-4.9897

Fenton was praised by the Jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony , which was far above his age .	-4.1367
And Toffee received bribes for his appearance and personality .	-2.6584
Fenton got Toffee as a gift to his third birthday last March and has been wearing the Shetland Pony every day since .	-5.3621
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and Toffee are a great span . ”	-5.8355
They had to compete against the entire entrant field and went out of place with gold and rosette .	-4.4426
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with Toffee and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.2206
Fully foreign in the arena thought that he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-4.4646
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebw Vale , South Wales , follows the footsteps of his Tante Sharon Howell , who has been presenting horses for over ten years .	-4.8060
Howell told : “ The whole audience was as electric and everyone fired and bottled it . ”	-4.1498
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and , although he resembled so tiny , he did a fantastic job .	-4.9371
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of .	-2.4861
As he has started , it will not take long to be on the “ horse of the year ” chase – and I am sure he will cut well .	-4.8913
A spokesman of the annual horse discovery said , “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-4.2189
Together they are a great team .	-0.5823
The jurors judged Fenton and Toffee how well they beaten and presented themselves in the preliminary round .	-4.0999
They pay attention to good cooperation between Pony and Leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-3.9040
I am sure that Fentons of sweet clothing has contributed their part , which is a perfect occasion .	-5.1597
The Chinese newspaper is supposed to be “ reformed ” after call .	-2.7817
A Chinese newspaper called for the release of a reporter accused of defamation had to be reformed on the front page declared a press regulator .	-3.8228
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.7650
But Chen later admitted on television that he had adopted bribes to counterbalance reports about a partial company .	-3.4090
Now the new Express is subjected to a “ comprehensive rectification ” , the regulator declared .	-3.8839
The Rectification Order was issued by the Agency for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-3.5361
Preliminary inquiries have shown that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several incorrect reports on the listing company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-4.9711
“ The editorial management of the New Express was unordered , ” the Regulatory Authority issued a statement .	-3.0164
She said that it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting licence . ”	-3.6043
In addition , “ Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to undertake a full rectification of the New Express and recommended that those responsible for the New Express be identified and immediately review the New Express management team . ”	-6.4747
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoomlion .	-3.7541
After he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and replied behind his journalistic work .	-2.9754
But then Chen appeared in the public TV show and admitted that he published false reports against payment .	-4.5331
“ In this case , I hurt Zoomlion , as well as the entire intelligence sector and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the state news channel CTV .	-5.6053
I did so primarily because I was on money and fame .	-1.8441
I have become clear that I have been mistaken .	-3.2326
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that it failed to properly review the reports .	-4.3671
Various well-known suspects have recently departed from television constellations .	-4.4000

Drug tunnel with its own railways between the US and Mexico is discovered .	-2.8886
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electrical railways , has now been discovered .	-3.5842
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres of measuring tunnels as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever had .	-5.3521
The tunnel that runs in the zickzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.4209
There are countless invisible warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide with drugs loaded trucks .	-3.7994
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could not be transported in it , the authorities declared it .	-2.4570
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of Marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , the record of the Court .	-3.6667
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged for ownership and the intended sale of Marihuana and cocaine .	-3.1243
They threaten imprisonment for ten years and for life .	-2.4687
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels .	-2.2535
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.1219
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico after the Marihuana harvest in October , posing the challenge that drug cartels can bring their product quickly to consumers .	-4.7532
In 2010 , authorities found a barely 640 meters long passage with rails running from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two camps in San Diego .	-3.9856
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still loving .	-1.2708
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-1.9304
In an interview , however , Bloom said he and Kerr still love .	-5.5806
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn .	-1.5081
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about separating his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.6310
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes is not exactly as we plan or hope it " .	-4.1091
Kerr and he himself still loved , stressed the 36-year-old .	-2.3445
" We will support each other and love love Flynn 's parents " .	-1.9965
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their sons Flynn was born .	-2.2312
According to Lexika , Vegetarianism is based on vegetarianism , but it differs greatly from that .	-4.9002
For while vegetarians allow the consumption of sahnetorte , ice or a strong Edam , these grinders are not on the menu of a vegan .	-7.2504
Milk , cheese , eggs , besides withdrawing meat and fish , the vegan leaves from all animal products - honey is also denied .	-6.1107
Whatever remains , one may ask , but when looking closer , the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity .	-5.5810
" Browff 's strikes are very popular , " explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local Reform House , which has a variety of special products for Vegans .	-5.8040
Reuben Proctor also likes to visit the store at the Domgasse .	-3.2841
For 13 years now , the born New Zealand was living vegan , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I created my diet and became vegetarian " .	-6.5161
The next step took place around the turn of the century and I became a vegan .	-2.5623
" But the conviction was not only because of nutrition , but because of shoe selection , " says Proctor , who prefers art leather normal leather .	-9.8868
He acknowledged that in other day-to-day situations without animal products , too .	-5.4476
First and foremost , vegan is an ethics .	-1.7191
" I don 't want animals to die for me " , Proctor talks about the maxim of the vegans , which covers all the consumer behaviour .	-4.7580
Instead of leaving behind burgers , stirrers or rubber bears , the Vegan quickly discovered completely new products , and enthusiasm increased .	-5.2081
" It is a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " in fact , vegan is not a waiver , not an Ascese , but an enrichment , " assuming that the dietary shift will reduce the selection of food options , Proctor is more likely to return to the power of habit .	-8.4938
And it was these conditionality that led some to fail even so well intentioned attempts .	-5.1188
" The addiction factor is a very important factor that leaves many behind quickly , similar to smoking , " Proctor places a comparison .	-5.8511
And if there is one : " Some tastes are not fixed on the animal " .	-5.4952
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.4687
" You can also generate the same effect in other ways , " illustrates the Vegans .	-3.6101
For example , Proctor has a BBBQ fist , which includes eggs , champignons and a couple of vegetables .	-9.1363
It takes care of a balanced , varied diet , and it should taste it softly .	-5.7687
Of course , one wants to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.9002
" It should taste , but this is not only to reduce animal food , " says Proctor .	-3.3653
Healthy damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption he did not suffer .	-2.7641
For me , the conversion was one positive aspect .	-2.2082
I don 't take a strange cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin content .	-2.7488
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan .	-2.8469
" My blood values are excellent , I leave me often check " , tell Proctor .	-4.2680
Particularly before the lack of vitamin B12 many Vegansi critics warn .	-6.4105
" Since animals with feedingstuffs are nourished instead of grazing on the pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cooling truhe purchases , the vitamin 12-percentage is high " Proctor finds .	-6.3842
Vegans can take the coenzym in the form of tablets .	-3.4066
" My B12 values are in order " , he explains .	-1.4841
There is a long way to go from Proctor for the procurement of food .	-4.4324
After all , there are staple foods everywhere and every supermarket now has sojamilch and other products .	-4.5499
All I need is local .	-2.3097
I only buy something special from time to time .	-3.4274
" Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive , but so it is well known for " ordinary " finished products .	-4.6582
The preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than previously thought .	-5.9097
" In the house kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small knives you can achieve good , if not partly better , " says Proctor .	-4.5589
Proctor was able to put his swimmers to a standstill .	-9.9955
The Vegan family festivities a new dignity .	-4.7682
This is dynamic if you cook together , and it is very important .	-4.5822
" The situations that can arise are as diverse as the people themselves " says Proctor .	-2.8397
Of course , he has already received scepticism .	-2.9831
Do not taste my meal anymore ?	-2.7525
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - as a vegan , you have to act with finger sentiment in this way .	-7.0985
" I don 't reject people , I am part of this society , " Proctor doesn 't want to run an enclave .	-4.0671
And , more precisely , everyday life doesn ’ t seem as strange as it would – and the vegan doesn ’ t seem to be so limited as usual in everyday life .	-8.3656
Fast Food is also allowed .	-1.6929
Pommes exist everywhere !	-1.6179
" Many dön shops offer fabels , or just a vegetarian yufa , " says Proctor .	-5.0320
In a pizzeria he turns out on pasta dishes , or ordered a pizza without cheese , everything a matter of habit .	-3.9415
The restaurants are so slow in coming .	-3.2285
" When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult " , the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , bring them to their attention " .	-6.0923
" When enough inquiries come , they may be inclined to supplement the menu " , he hopes .	-3.8353
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the Mannheim combus or the Café Vogelfre .	-5.5085
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants at least have a vegan meal on the menu .	-4.4085
Vegan dishes are basically available for everyone .	-3.5302
Everyone can eat it , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.3926
" Meat dishes are , however , exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they close others " , Proctor states .	-4.0718
" If we want to avoid food scandals , then Veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority of them impossible " , says Proctor .	-3.9377
However , purchasing vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-3.3185
Especially , if you learn to understand which , even on earth , animal additives can contain as a color donor , it seems that , with so many hurdles and traps , you can quickly leave the courage .	-7.5304
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganismo - Animals and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are adding food and cleaning agents .	-3.6874
" After gradually developing a scanner view and knows which characters and logos you have to pay attention " It is sometimes better to do little steps than to stand or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-6.0739
The Veganism , he is an important moral finger that beats mind .	-3.3643
Perhaps he does not entirely manage to disprove his habits , but at least he can teach the consumer to question his habits critically .	-4.8800
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in Atem .	-2.4118
The trade at Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on the Friday afternoon of German time .	-3.0360
The operator was responsible for technical problems in a communication .	-1.7718
The other 11 US options markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.6932
The latest incident continues a series of smaller and larger tanks at the stock exchange operator .	-3.3712
Only on Tuesday the Nasdaq indexes had not been calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport .	-3.2848
In August this year there were two tanks alone in one week .	-2.3816
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs sent heavily flawed purchases to the options markets because of technical problems .	-4.6342

British police forces forces Assange to issue an extradition certificate .	-3.4338
Today , the British police have passed a line of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum .	-4.4149
Scotland Yard explained that 40 year old Australians were given a “ invitation to stand ” demanding him to appear in a police guard , and added , if he did not honour that , he threatened him to be arrested .	-7.1504
Assange is threatening to extradite to Sweden for charges in a sex offence , after its possibilities have been exhausted by British law , since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition earlier this month .	-6.0980
Because he fears that Stockholm would send him to the US , he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.7018
Scotland Yard “ sent a 40-year-old man an invitation to join a police guard at a time that we elected . ”	-4.6711
He continues to violate the terms of his release to bail .	-2.1127
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police request .	-3.6000
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States , accused of having published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks revelation website .	-4.7852

Howie was also sentenced to pay for 90 <unk> expenses and a sacrifice supplement of 100 <unk> .	-4.3330
Tax for foreign property owners against London ’ s Speculation Bubble	-2.9324
The Treasury has progressively calculated the CGT measure , but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who in the 2012 budget imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on housing that cost more than two million pounds , and who hold annual fees for buyers , apartments as a company and not as individuals .	-6.5863
Already , revenues from the stamp tax for residential property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea are exceeding GBP 708 million in the 2012 / 13 fiscal year , collecting proceeds for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , North-West , Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-5.3982
Cook said , “ After the increases in the stemple tax on high-cost housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against a turnover , it is hard to say that high quality property is too low , regardless of the effects of the outdated local taxation system . ”	-7.7960
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more reticent about buying property in London , or discourage owners , ” he added .	-3.4354
First class real estate – the top five to ten per cent of the housing market on price – in the wealthy London southwest belt , stretching from Fulham to Wimbledon , have risen by a record of 11.8 % last year .	-5.7559
The prices in Central London had an equal annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where the south-west part of the city , the North ( 7.4 % ) , and the East ( 6.5 % ) experienced a upward trend , such as Savill ’ s investigation .	-5.7013
Scientists could cast more light on the context in which a dog ’ s tail is conjuncted .	-4.9636
Former research showed that happy dogs with the tail weighed more to the right ( from the dog 's point of view ) , while nervous dogs were the left .	-4.5138
But scientists now say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-1.5672
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trient , said : “ humans know well that the left and right brain coats react differently to stimuli that causes positive or negative emotions . ”	-4.4548
We have tried to look at this in other species .	-2.3120
He also noticed that , for dogs , the right brain pitches were responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-5.1977
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral flowers of their arts , researchers monitored the animals , while these films were seen by other dogs .	-5.8453
It measured the heart rate of the four-legs and analyzed the behavior .	-3.4111
We will probably soon understand why the tail is heading in one , and then in the other direction .	-3.5449
As Professor Vallortigara said , “ We have shown dogs with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distant other aspects , and in doing so we could control the movement of the tail to left or right . ”	-5.2792
When the animals saw a dog that was otherwise impressively pushed the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the blind dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-6.0579
But if the tail was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog who bleeds ) , their heart rate rose and they looked alarming .	-5.2690
Professor Vallortigara believes that dogs do not deliberately communicate through these movements .	-2.7245
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience on which movements they should worry , and when not .	-4.0954
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and the dog is associated with the tail in one direction more with friendly behavior , and the right side produces less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.3072
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to understand their animal 's emotions better .	-3.5436
John Bradshaw , expert on dog behavior and pupils at the University of Bristol ’ s Faculty of Animal Health , said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs .	-5.0476
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln discovered that dogs turn their head to the left when they see an aggressive dog , and to the right when they are a satisfied dog .	-3.9523
In a different research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog if their tail is weathing on the left and not right , rather than being alarming – precisely elsewhere than in the Italian study . ”	-7.0687
According to his statement , the differences could therefore stir that dogs in the different studies did not interpret animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .	-4.7019
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help he .	-2.2412
“ Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain vessels are used for different purposes , many still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-3.7987
Since their behavior simply signifies , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes the other .	-4.7238
Arctic Monkeys Moves appearance in Glasgow due to Alex Turner 's disease	-2.7052
The Arctic Monkeys Rockband has moved a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer gets caught with a chain dust .	-6.2954
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in Hydro on Friday .	-2.2561
However , due to the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner , the concert has to be moved .	-3.7900
The announcement of the band came after she had already postponed an appearance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-4.3728
In an explanation on its official website , the Arctic Monkeys participated : “ After the decision to cancel the show at LG Arena in Birmingham this evening , and on medical advice , Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show in Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , November 1 . ”	-8.0575
“ Alex Turner diagnosed a chain dung , which is why he cannot appear . ”	-5.0408

Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals in February	-7.3314
Pope Francis will first convene new cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-2.6464
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who choose a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.3370
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-0.9232
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope Election – that is , a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals ” .	-5.7296
In a statement in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman of the Vatican , said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinal , which is also known as the consiorum .	-6.2026
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistium in February in advance , so that other meetings requiring the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-4.6511
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have declined by February .	-3.0600
He explained that a Pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of eligible cardinals is 120 again , and as many cardinals as he wants .	-4.7689
The consortium next year is significant because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Valero .	-4.2942
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and in particular Italy .	-2.9428
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-2.0795
Four percent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-4.3106
The Cardinals will also be the first to call the Cardinal Council since the formation of the Franciscan Council , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the task of finding opportunities to reform the Church .	-5.2051
In the past , the Pope chose everything alone .	-1.8246
“ Now Francis selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” Valero said .	-2.6399
He explained that it was “ possible ” that Franziskus should ask for advice on the cardinals .	-4.9557
But we have not been able to do so until now – that is all very new .	-3.5429
Valero said that the bishops would typically call cardinals from large places , but Francis is “ full of surprises – we don ’ t know who he appoints . ”	-5.0648
GM is calling for new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seat leap	-3.3962
General Motors call almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with a construction year 2014 to fix a problem with the manually adjustable seats , such as a statement from the US Auto Safety Regulatory on Friday .	-6.2360
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for withdrawing the Chairman ’ s loan .	-4.8761
For this reason , they do not comply with the federal directives on vehicle safety at the head restraints .	-3.2989
“ When the back of the vehicle is mounted , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-5.7976
The returned models were manufactured between August 1 and September 10 .	-2.1947
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the leading American car manufacturer since the bankruptcy restructuring in 2009 .	-4.7166
GM informed the vehicle owners of the defect in the first October half .	-4.2923
NHTSA could not check the notification letter due to its 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-5.5543
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks newly developed for the 2014 model year had risen by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , explained GM on Friday .	-4.2408
In October , GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra Pickup Trucks .	-3.0868

In the evening , when I ’ m ready to do and go to bed , the book brings me back to a time when politics was inspired by millions and a speeches that could kill the breath .	-7.5060
The election was a landslide victory and news leaders held to realize the historic importance of this hour .	-4.1682
My classmates wept with joy , and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-4.1493
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.3658
When Obama changed office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval .	-2.7185
And then I finish the book .	-1.7799
Turning to the present is a malignant awakening as if one is struck out of a dream .	-4.5301
It is hard to recall these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder , a sad reminder of misplaced possibilities .	-2.8327
In the years since I first cast my vote , something has actually changed .	-3.0059
But it is nothing I could have imagined .	-2.0964
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.2547
I agree that the partisan political blockade tactics have overturned many aspirations that should push our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.8730
But , having defended the Obama administration by colleagues and acquaintances on countless occasions , I have come to the end with my attempts to make an explan.	-5.2840
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.3472
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to intercept or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas .	-3.2305
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblower are punished disclosing government misconduct .	-4.5387
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and spending are evaded during the presidential election .	-4.4565
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House ’ s efforts to restore the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon Government . ”	-4.2090
And , recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was adopted .	-3.1171
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected .	-1.6700
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could have contradicted its pre-eminent political .	-3.5176
Obviously , the Parliamentary Office is not a predictable course , since an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-4.7561
But when I look at the above examples , they seem largely elected by the government itself .	-2.5839
And that bothers me most .	-1.3916
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.1560
Mitt Romney was a confusing and untapped alternative , he seemed not to be able to determine his direction and positions .	-4.7536
I had the impression that a second term in office for Obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard for so long .	-3.1693
But , with the sense of approval for Obama to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become much harder by this book .	-4.0735
It gives me the longing for the many promises that have disappeared in the air .	-3.5246
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to make a serious loss against Clinton in the early elections in Pennsylvania .	-3.3581
In a meeting with the electorate following the decision , he told his staff that they had to get back on track and follow the purpose of their business .	-5.2408
“ I want us to find our magic , ” he said .	-6.2222
We must remember who we are .	-1.1034

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave .	-2.3598
The billionaire and Member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters could become pregnant and benefit from it .	-3.4734
The mining magnate , which is in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 taxes , argued when he wanted to wipe questions from the table about whether he was in a conflict .	-6.7850
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important in deciding whether or not to eliminate CO2 and mining taxes .	-3.4262
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.7210
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters is pregnant , he has a direct interest in obtaining or not , ” said Palmer .	-3.7964
Two months after the election , the Palmer Election Commission , with 53 votes , officially declared a winner in Fairfax , after the recount .	-4.9331
Palmer called for a review of the voting counting process to be made faster .	-4.3622
Tony Abbotts daughter Frances and Bridget .	-1.1734
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.4910
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-0.8751
Why should we not have a system where you march in , enter the data into a computer , select it immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in ?	-5.1152
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking ballot papers .	-3.4675
Is it used , because you can wipe out the results if you do not like them ?	-3.4000
It is incredible to vote with pencil lifts nowadays .	-3.5884
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.4646
Palmer , 59 , explained that his policy includes an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “ very seriously ” .	-3.3375
At a public office it is public service .	-2.3021
“ We strive for no reward other than history , namely that we can serve in a critical time of this community , ” he said .	-3.7397
RBS suspended two foreigners	-0.8484
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its Forex Department , two of whom are familiar with the situation , and this is yet another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the presumed currency market manipulation is on the move .	-5.4449
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion a day exchanges the hol.	-4.6190
The two retailers would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the wide-ranging investigation that the scandal relates to the Lebor interbank business .	-5.7290
The Bank , which made no comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .	-2.7565
“ Our investigations on this matter continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-3.0020
Last month , those close to the situation reported that the RBS sent the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former trader to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-5.1887
This trader , Richard Usher , had left RBS 2010 and is due to have been deprived of his current position as European leader of Forex Pot Trade at JPMorgan .	-5.6371
Rohan Ramchandani , Head of the European Spot Trading at Citi , was deprived this week and Matt Gardiner , a former senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-4.4621
None of these traders were accused of any failure .	-2.6478
Bankers belonging to the instant message group of Usher at Barclays and the Citigroup said persons close to the situation .	-3.7419
UBS announced this week that she took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss Regulatory Authority , Finma , stated that she was investigating a presumptive manipulation of the currency market in a number of Swiss banks .	-5.0590
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Agency Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently guilty of accusations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market .	-5.4821
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also started internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said with the situation familiar persons .	-2.9648
Banks go through Messages and e-mails from several years in search of misconduct .	-3.3207
The news about these investigations has put the traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year has been under pressure , because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .	-8.8133
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the expanded and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading retailers believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.9840
A leading retailer noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of its own internal platforms by banks has led to the “ being able to influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-6.1221
The news came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she was cancelling a trader of their London Exchange Traded Fund offices this week after he lost almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.7079
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and collaborates with them .	-2.5515
" We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is contained , " explained Credit Suisse .	-3.6404
Charming the Bauzaun on the Beachle plot	-3.5712
A group of citizens ' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " seized the Bauzaun on the Bechtle plot on the courtyard promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-5.4883
Also acidic and spread the foot path , it is called in a press release .	-3.3680
The planned cover of the crumbling house at the back of the land was not permitted for security reasons , because the area threatens to slip away .	-5.6523
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the plot , had arranged the sealing action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-4.1552
Before the BI was involved , a transparency was attached with the message " We were in favour " .	-4.2789
But that did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative .	-3.4488
Their motto on the big poster was " We are against building ruins " .	-3.0002
As a result , she wanted to point out the risk of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - one day the giant project should fail .	-5.1154
When talking to many people before the " Building Centre " , it became clear that some citizens believe that it would be better with the implementation of the city project , although few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-6.8155
But they start to resign , because the city continues to delay these answers , says it from the BI .	-4.0715
As we heard , public statements by the Mayor also look like .	-4.4258
In May the municipal meeting said that he feared the spas for the thermal baths , the public should vote against plans for a spa and spa complex on the Swiss meadow when deciding on the citizens ' decision .	-6.8305
Some therefore seem to be scandalous , others see it as a " plummet attempt to blackmail " to the population , says it in the BI press release .	-6.8711
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .	-3.3867
Rangnick Challenge for Shiris : No Double	-4.2832
Ralf Rangnick 's current high form of Bundesliga tablet leader Red Bull Salzburg was so disappointed that the sports director of the " bulls " was shown by the referee .	-6.7702
" There is a dangerous tendency at the moment for men and Alan to be pushed into the Schwalben category , " he defended the two offensive wires at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-5.8052
Recent occasion for Rangnick ’ s critique was Yellow for Mane on 3 : 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday , in which the Senegalese got a supposed actress - which was not , of course , as the TV images showed .	-8.7871
" A crass misrepresentation , " Rangnick said , that arbitrator Hargate was known as " completely overburdened " .	-6.5307
Harig also had " his part " contributed to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Value Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-4.6985
His German compatriot defended him decisively : " In each situation I would have behaved the same way as Roger Schmidt " .	-4.9847
Schmidt himself wants no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with his husband .	-3.9583
I do not know why .	-1.4744
" Because I am the one who was offended , " said the 46-year-old .	-2.8526
Rangnick , however , agreed to praise in the light of the success story .	-4.4524
" There are only two words for this : Correct good , " he noted .	-4.8849
There is not much to be suspended .	-2.3727
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-1.8414
Let me just go on like that .	-3.7451
Kaders in the winter transfer period will hardly be there .	-3.1841
There are no great reasons for changing things .	-1.9825
" Unlike a player , Rangnick has made clear that he wants to leave the club .	-5.8748
Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-1.8991
It is a major victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the closely linked health law with Barack Obama is constitutional .	-3.5555
With five to four votes , judges judged that the individual mandate of Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to close health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the fiscal authority of the state .	-4.7759
The chief judge John Roberts suggested the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy judges decided against it .	-4.1147
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages general law , and also argued that the provision of the health law that states would either have to expand access requirements for Medicid or otherwise cancel all state medicaids would not be unconstitutional .	-7.2512
The legal proceedings against the law had been tried by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-3.4255
The law was strongly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger , Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-2.8745
Norway : Giant Spiegels Light	-6.9013
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian learning have brought light into their gloomy valley .	-3.9101
Due to the low level of sunlight , the Rjukan located in the Vestfjord valley from autumn to spring usually falls in the shadow of the surrounding mountains .	-4.7434
Three gigantic reflectors of 45 metres high were preserved on Wednesday .	-4.2973
" Finally ! " , mayor Steinar Bergsland dwinds at the beginning ceremony in the TV2 channel .	-5.3610
Some people of the valley recreated solar chairs , others set up safety-half-sunglasses .	-5.2588
Until now , sun-hungry women had to travel to a nearby summit in winter with a cableway .	-4.7391
Ten years ago , the local artist , Martin Andersen , had presented the proposal to direct the beam with mirrors into the valley .	-3.7302
However , this basic idea has been in place since 1913 .	-3.2627
After several years of debate , the city council finally adopted the 5 million crown ( around EUR 615 000 ) expensive project .	-5.1352
A similar construction has been providing vineyard sunshine for several years .	-4.2616
Very few empty Sundays	-3.1121
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red points for the Sunday empty are still in various postboxes of the city and its parts , but if you read the small printed on the yellow containers of the Post AG , you will soon find out that the loading on Sundays and holidays is no longer held " , shares the FDP with .	-9.1614
A FDP request confirmed this .	-1.7409
On Sundays and public holidays only before the postal building in Ernst Ludwig-Straße 36 and in the Jakob-Müller Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-3.9861
Whether it is used on Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten will not be answered in the answer to the FDP request .	-4.2111
The Socialist and juvenile spokesman for the FDP , Fritz Röhrbeck , wants to recover here .	-3.7775
The Sunday empty is just an important postal service .	-4.3250
" This undertaking is sparsely and unreasonable despite the price increase in letters on January 2013 . "	-7.9801
Thomas Bittner , the leader of the Liberal Group , supports his group colleagues : " What annoys me is the fact that slammerly changes or even deletes periods of learning . "	-6.3572
The post office is a bit far away from the town .	-3.6677
" At least , the letters in the districts of Neuschloß and Rosengarten will have to be taught again on Sunday " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-5.5303
Even for the core city , especially non-mobile citizens would have to be able to reach a letter box with Sunday empty .	-6.1280
Röhrbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post office on this matter .	-4.5601
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.9164
But in Hofheim , his knowledge also gives a Sunday empty .	-4.4635
Your party has indeed argued in favour of privatisation .	-2.8814
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " said Maier .	-1.2858
Frankfurt parking fees should rise vigorously .	-2.9293
Staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.3641
This morning , the city 's Magistrat Council advises on a presentation of traffic decreer Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-5.0107
Therefore parking charges are to be increased by 50 percent .	-2.8404
However , we should not increase prices but reduce the time interval of parking and parking tickets from 30 minutes to 20 minutes .	-4.5749
In December , the Municipal Council will have to decide .	-4.5301
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-2.9090
The parking possibility in front of the shop is " an unbeatable advantage for smaller retailers " .	-5.0886
The German Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is " fairly appropriate and , in fact , long overdue " .	-3.7813
Public transport will also become more expensive .	-1.7197
Freudencity : Speedy actions overrumping host	-4.4857
With a small cader , men I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to compete in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb .	-5.1327
The elderly stood with an experienced team on the other network side .	-3.3596
However , soon it became apparent that they were unable to keep up with the rapid actions of the Freudencity .	-6.0290
The Gönninger took an extremely difficult position with the tough and plated scenes .	-6.5349
They once again missed the passports and attacks gamed by Simon Schulz and Eduard Schulz clean over the network centre and were not on the spot .	-5.3644
Two first-rate wages clearly expressed the superiority of the frequent cities in every respect .	-7.1036
In view of this shocking and playing performance , the third sentence was then won somewhat lash and loose to 3 : 0 endstand ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 25 , 25 : 22 ) .	-10.9313
On November 2nd , the TV Baiersbronn , which was able to achieve clearly in Nagold , will be a far more powerful opponent in the field .	-5.4644
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Buchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pölchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-2.4861
The second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn in Baier. was . , and . , , , ,	-7.2200
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match .	-2.6332
Nervositity on both sides mainly caused bugs and point cookies ; the precision was sometimes defective , and in some critical game scenes , the overrunners prevented the view of possible punctuation .	-8.5375
In this highly balanced encounter , the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently agreed to the great physical dedication and a pleasant commitment of both teams .	-8.7652
Care Day at the Small England Hut	-4.0402
In the meantime fifth maintenance day in the succession of the Natura 2000 project upper hotzenwald met a group of dedicated participants at the small English lodge in Ibach .	-4.6328
Because of suggestions from the population , this day , in the area of the hut of sight , should be cut off into the valley , Mayor Helmut Kaiser said .	-6.6234
Many hikers , Kaiser , called this area as the splendid part of the Gorge , where the landscape is the ideal setting for magnificent views .	-6.0770
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that care day was an appropriate instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-4.6175
It gives every citizen the opportunity to emphasize in nature itself .	-3.5161
At the same time as the tourist aspect , ecological consideration could also be found .	-3.3142
This ecological aspect outlined Friederike Tribukait from the Natural Protection Department of the Governing Board of Freiburg following the greeting of Tilman Bollaker , who took over the patronage and wanted a good success .	-6.6755
According to Tribukait , the tourist aim of the Weitschen is to preserve the old Alpine wine field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures .	-8.0530
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grassworks , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.6020
You need these free Armory links .	-3.8333
Tribukait said that she would not miss the opportunity to break a lance for the planned biosphere .	-4.5177
In this planning , the current measure does not just enter seamlessly .	-3.2905
A biosphere area also offers the opportunity to sustain economic and ecological development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status and , hence , to complement the Life project and the previous maintenance achievements for the future .	-5.5195
After these various statements , Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff joined the helpers in groups .	-5.2289
The larger trees had already been beaten in the run-up to the forestry trawlers , where appropriate they would be ready to go .	-8.9112
A group of helpers should take care of the release of Wacholder pockets and the maintenance of a dry-stone iron .	-6.3211
The aim was to make a free view of the viewpoint .	-3.6680

Egypt America ’ s First freely elected Presidents	-2.5384
Mohammed Morsi declines in office , but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt .	-3.4421
Islamist Mohammad Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was first freely elected president of the country , thereby imposing the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been displaced from office 16 months earlier .	-4.4448
With his inauguration to the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 .	-4.0076
He abandoned the oid before the 18 in black robes judges of the court , which is based on the Nile and is traced to an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.4476
“ We strive for a better future , a new Egypt and a second Republic , ” Morsi said at the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live on state television .	-3.1720
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an engineer trained in the United States and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its founding 84 years ago , had been severely targeted as a banned organization by the government .	-5.7310
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen watched the building when Morsi met in a small autoconvoi shortly after eleven clock .	-4.3723
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to rejoice the new president , and , unlike the Presidential Prunk of the Mubarak era , traffic was stopped in a short time so that the autoconvoi could cross the usually lively road linking the city centre to the southern suburbs .	-8.1607
As an uncharismatic “ substitute wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech that he presented himself not only as a candidate for Islamists , but all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-5.9223
“ Egypt today is a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the Morsi , claiming in a blue suit with a red tie , declared the judges in the wood-shaped chamber in which he left office .	-6.3445

He was officially welcomed by an army chapel playing the national anthem that he listened to in hanging .	-4.0617
The military leader Feldmarshal Hussein Tantawi was present .	-2.0736
At his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of attendees in the greatest hearing hall of the university with spokespersons of “ The Army and the people are a hand ” .	-5.4361
The University of Cairo , built in 1908 as a base of secular education , has developed into a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .	-4.0637

But by putting the official egg in front of the court , and not , as usual , before Parliament , he bears the will of the military , pointing out that the struggle for power will continue .	-6.5355
Mursi ’ s speech at Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-2.6730

Kana admitted to have been in a bar during the night of the Tatnacht .	-4.2273
He also admitted to have beaten and raped , but he insisted on being responsible for the death of the girl .	-2.8644
The police first assumed several perpetrators , but dismissed two suspects , because the evidence against them was inadequate .	-4.2516
The prosecutor also stressed during the process that she was convinced that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .	-2.9530
In South Africa , rape is almost daily : there are about 64 000 ads of sexual violence per year .	-5.0275
This is almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people there are far more people than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-3.9789
Police and women ’ s associations in South Africa estimate , however , the dark rate of sexual violence at 10-25 times .	-4.5414

You thought travel agents are part of the past thanks to the Internet ?	-2.9140
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend .	-1.4786
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and is expecting recoveries from tourists in Australia and Great Britain .	-5.8034
The travel company now operates from a adjusted annual gain of between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to 315 million in its previous forecast .	-4.8492
If current targets are met , it will mean a growth of 12 to 17 % compared with a record gain of $ 290.4 million in the period 2011 / 12 .	-4.6976
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and spent a strong start in the second half of the year , especially in Australia and British private .	-4.7521
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well headed toward record year revenues before interest and taxes , ” he said .	-4.2017
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which typically belong to our strongest earnings .	-2.7965
In Australia , the recreational sector has recovered in the second half of the year , leaving a slightly weaker market for business trips .	-3.2644
Likewise , Flight Centre ’ s recreational business in the United Kingdom , while its business customers spent less .	-5.9550
US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first half year , with a third year result expecting a profit for the year as a whole .	-5.7312

In courses of English literature , students will have to deal with at least one piece of Shakespeare , a novel of the 19th century , romantic lyric and contemporary British novels from 1914 .	-3.8495
The examination also includes “ unseen texts ” to encourage broader reading .	-4.6384
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished .	-1.4543
As of 2015 , pupils will have to make their own GCSE exam in language , with strong incentives to choose English literature as separate qualification .	-5.4121
The Ministry of Education will publish tomorrow the new curricula for English and mathematics – the first subjects that were radically transformed .	-3.7345
Other core subjects will be changed next year .	-1.1642
In a separate initiative , Ofqual , the supervisory authority for examinations , will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures , including a new system of bending and fewer short work .	-4.7651
In a summer speech , Secretary of Education Michael Gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system in order to restore public confidence , ” emphasising that the GCS would become “ challengers , more ambitious , and more stringent . ”	-5.1161
Studies show that in English schools , less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .	-6.1444
In contrast , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore get 138 hours .	-2.9623
While there will be no formal requirement to foresee more time for mathematics in the hour plan , from coalition circles , the comprehensive math test – combined with a greater emphasis on the ranking field – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours .	-6.5106
The curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life , ” including financial mathematics .	-2.2039

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Forum	-1.5724
At the next Ecumenical Meeting Forum on Monday , 21 October , at the Neuer Museum of the Palace , the theme " The Hell with Hell - Theological considerations on how to deal with the last things " is .	-6.1348
Professor Johanna Rahner is a lecturer .	-1.8028
The Ecumenical Meeting Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parish of Salem , Salem Castle and the Bodensee Region .	-3.4235
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum how today people classified the " last things " after death .	-3.0802
If people had known too much over the past few centuries , putting on the images of heaven and hell , " which until today shape our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic lesson of hopes for completion is more characterized by a certain amount of embarrassment or even lingualism .	-7.8347
" Greater hope has been exhausted by religious criticism to Christians , " says the speaker .	-3.3548
She gave us so many question marks that the exclamations seem to have lost us .	-3.8263
Johanna Rahner continues to say : " But the crucial challenge remains the troublesome of death " .	-3.5644
Thus , the question of the desire to see , " which dreams that in the end all things may be good " .	-5.8287
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-1.8281
She promoted Dr. theol in 1997 , also in Freiburg .	-2.6303
The Habilitation of Fundamental Heology and Ecumenical Theology followed in 2003 at the Westgelische Wilhelms University .	-4.1206
Since 2010 Johanna Rahner has held a PhD for Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .	-4.1399

In the morning , the service was accompanied by the Laudato group , in the afternoon of the youth choir The Spirit .	-4.8569
With the reception of the firmsacrament , young people said yes to their baptism and asked the power of the Holy Ghost .	-3.0980
In the last few months , under the leadership of Diakon Reiner Dehner and with the help of many community members , the company had prepared for the big day .	-5.8641
In various projects they met various tasks of the Christian community level and experienced the Youth Day in Untermachtal .	-4.9164
Ilmensee : Two mountain bike races excited participants .	-2.5006
With wonderful weather , 214 cyclists came to Ilmensee to manage the course across the hill ranges around the lake .	-4.8780
Ulrich Knofel shares this with the organising sport club Ilmensee .	-4.4178
Among the participants were , especially at short distances over 15 kilometres and 300 height meters , a number of Jedermann cyclists wishing to practise their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere .	-7.0180
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also on the start of this race : Felix Baders from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with a recommendation for good placement in the German Championships .	-5.5705
These two were able to withdraw from the field as expected .	-3.9022
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to rescue a small period of time until the end and defended his title as a total winner of the short distance .	-5.2615
Two of the Pascal Treubels were able to place again .	-5.6141
On the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of Team Altrum , who made it high on the side of the Siegertreppen .	-5.6699
Two and three Anne Adel from Ilmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen came in space .	-3.2764
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-2.9011
The full range of athletes was represented not only in terms of performance .	-3.1094
The old age structure also ran among the oldest stars in the youngest up to 70 years .	-3.9210
In the main race this year more absolute top athletes were on the start .	-4.1286
Four drivers were able to depart from the regional leaders .	-3.1888
Under Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk racing team .	-3.5760
Together with a team mate , Pangerl was two times the world champion in twelve hours driving .	-3.6092
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline .	-2.4161
Roland Ballerstedt , who already calls his own two German master titles in the Duathlon .	-4.1888
After 45 kilometers and 900 metres of altitude , there was a finals of the hopper in the finish in front of the Three Sea Hall .	-6.9183
Pangerl was the first to cross the target line .	-3.0006
Only a second behind this , Routinier Ballerstedt was able to secure second place in overall evaluation .	-4.6183
Hermann and Warthmann came to the target as a third of the overall rating .	-4.3615
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the main race .	-3.3744
Areane Blersch was the second place in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart .	-3.8450

Driving through sludge , rivers and jungle for free medical care .	-2.6035
Dr. Georges Bwell provides free medical assistance in remote villages in Cameroon .	-2.2978
Blwells and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-1.8179
There are not many doctors in the West African country , just one for 5,000 people .	-2.5792
Vote here or with your mobile device	-2.0855
Dr. Georges Bwell is one of the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ” .	-2.6829
You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the top 10 to select him for the “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-3.1083
The winner gets $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.6510
For 21 years , Georges Bwell looked at how his sick father lost awareness and traveled to hospitals who did not have the means to help him .	-4.5354
Jamef Bwell was injured in 1981 with an accident close to Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-6.3975
At first , he had only a broken arm , but then there was an inflammation that expanded into his brain , causing a hematom that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-5.1911
“ There was no neurosurgeon in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwell .	-3.3395
We would have released it from Cameroon if we had had had the money .	-2.2057
Instead , it spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-4.4981
“ It ’ s not easy , ” Blower commented .	-3.4333
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and go to the hospital to be the first , but is not the first .	-4.0839
There are many patients .	-1.3530
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-0.7951
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell 's father died in 2002 .	-2.5001
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , the World Health Organization .	-2.9523
Conversely , the relationship in the United States is a doctor for 413 people .	-4.5674
But even if there was a doctor for them , most cameras could not afford to visit .	-2.6665
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country are private .	-5.5995
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwell .	-2.4501
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.6853
Blwell 's father and many of his compatriots suffer from watching him .	-4.7301
Dr. Georges Blwell and his volunteer team performed 700 free operations last year .	-2.3408
He became a doctor himself and works as a prisoner surgeon in Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-4.8724
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical services there .	-3.7147
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 32,000 people .	-1.6026
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people are forced into small buses and travel on the roof over unfixed terrain to the villages that need help .	-6.4848
It is not always a good thing .	-2.4988
More than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.9887
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a festive meal , song and dance and the best accommodation to offer the place .	-4.3039
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and shaft – with its wide smile and limitless energy – happy to celebrate .	-5.3652
The next morning , the team will begin the investigation of hundreds of patients .	-6.1259
“ We handle 500 people per trip , ” said Bwellle .	-6.0740
They come from a circle of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-3.0789
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.7327
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.5324
Others receive crumbs , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-5.0281
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with a local stunt .	-3.1253
Operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after intervening patients stand up and go in the recreation area to make space for the next .	-5.0284
Lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is stored by the generator of the group , thus working well and his volunteers in the early morning hours of the Sunday .	-5.4350
It is a tough pensum , but villagers usually help keep the team motivated .	-3.1046
“ You are drunking all the night so that we can remain vigilant and continue our work , ” says Bwell .	-6.1082
The team then returned to the city on Sunday , tired but proud of the work they have done .	-3.8370
The group – a mixture of Cameron doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with their work , it makes a huge difference for the people to whom it helps .	-5.1725
One man explained that the free operation of a truck that he received now makes it possible to work again .	-4.0191
“ That changed the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.2328
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in hospital , Blwell also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-4.3680
With this second job , he financed 60 % of his nonprofit activity , according to Blwell ; the rest come from private donations .	-5.0617
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and is voluntarily involved in Bwelle 's group .	-4.6680
He is always in hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-3.7805
For medical and nursing patients such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support the bull , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-5.0156
“ We can be involved in operations where we help to tap blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwell , ” says O 'Malley .	-4.9365
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.2142
Students pay their trip to Cameroon normally and bring often donated sanitary material with them .	-4.5139
Once in Yaoundé , however , it is possible to travel , transport and instruction .	-6.1088
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.5611
He devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameron people knows no limits .	-3.4739
Almost constant work is not a burden on shaft .	-4.4116
To help others to live a happier life , thereby fulfilling a promise that he gave to his father , prepares him great joy .	-4.7303
“ I ’ m so happy to do this work , ” says Bwell .	-3.4496
And I have in mind my father . my are , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.6081
I hope he will see what I am doing .	-1.6278
I make it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.4982

Excellent Fighting	-3.7294
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , was cut by Horst Janson .	-3.4454
Janson is himself an old hate in his meter , the actress art .	-3.7694
No one can imagine fishing at the old man Santiago .	-2.6777
So the two just get great .	-2.7540
It is almost thought to be able to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of which the fishermen talk about Manolo .	-6.2127
When Santiago tired of life stays on the chair , this is true with Janson .	-4.1722
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson performs excellently .	-5.9079
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and his will .	-3.7090
Janson is on stage in broad distances as a single actor .	-3.9043
He manages to focus the attention of the public , so that his monologists are not boring for a moment .	-4.1873
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is made up of blue lighted water bottles .	-5.2674
Director Jens Hasselmann leaves the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.7810
In the course of the performance , he puts the active scene into light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with their songs and their wonderful voice , has a life-feeling of Cuba .	-6.7631
The four musicians play Kuba Rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-3.5837
Tourism : descent to the Romans	-1.2766
About 120 meters of length there is a Roman sewage channel below Cologne .	-3.9187
If you visit Cologne , you will not have to leave the Cathedral .	-5.3592
Around 157 meters the two towers reach the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-6.8930
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigrant churches can understand that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-5.6408
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the subject of Cologne subworld .	-2.2857
Meeting point for its tours is the service centre of Cologne Tourism directly at the cathedral .	-4.0222
The tour starts completely unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-2.3301
In the seventies , the city ’ s fathers wanted to be an authentic city , so the remains of the old city wall remained only what was not too big .	-5.8213
This is why most of the users of the parking house are now passing through the Roman remains and only putting their car off .	-5.9917
However , if you look more closely , the parkdeck D2 detects an archaeological site separated by metallic grids .	-6.1370
There are about five meters of high ruins of handheld stone .	-4.6588
" It is remnants of the Roman wall , built to Christ in the second half of the first century , " Schulze tells .	-3.2524
Before the daylight goes back , schools still have a look at the upper level participants in a darker , 15 m deep cheek .	-6.8965
This is the well of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly perceived .	-3.8968
Next station of the roundabout is the Pretorium , and here the participants get down to the depth .	-4.8369
Here we are witnessing the headquarters of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the CCAA pregnant .	-4.9874
What CCAA means is a visitor wants to know .	-1.6970
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in English as much as " the city of Roman law and city of the Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius at the town of Altas for the Kaiserkult " .	-6.1281
And the Pretorium is the former statth-old palace , the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-4.1896
From the exhibition hall there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is here at about 120 meters long .	-5.1172
" You can walk quite a bit along the Cloaca Maxima , if you want , " but Schulze takes up the guests .	-6.0095
A surprise is left to school .	-2.6476
After having caught the key at the ticket office , he leads the group to a 16-metre depository .	-6.4001
" We are now in Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.8331
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to come to the ground water , which was essential for ritual washings .	-4.5918
Until now , in the lower end of Mikwe , whose origins go back to the eighteenth century , different water levels can be seen by changing the Rhine .	-6.5919
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square , for which the work will begin soon .	-3.9443
A few years later , however , will be completed .	-4.2984
Be it Hard : Recovery of Rocker Process	-4.2262
A bloody attack in the Rockermilieu is rolled back after four years .	-2.8369
A process for attempting deaths , dangerous body injury and material damage to two 30-year-old people began before the Frankfurt District Court ( Oder ) .	-5.3632
It is accompanied by strict security precautions .	-2.0834
The defendants went up for a while .	-4.6563
They are supposed to have been active in the rocker scene and then heard among the Bandidos .	-4.9160
The Public Prosecutor 's Office asks them to join in a car in June 2009 with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt to three men .	-5.0014
All victims were seriously injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .	-2.3630
The victims are to have heard the competing group Hells Angels .	-4.0115
A high-level member of Berlin was to have been one .	-3.9090
Apparently , a persecution hunt with several cars was preceded .	-2.8556
According to the indictment , there was a fight for survival and a demonstration of power .	-4.6974
The two defendants had been released in a first trial in early 2012 .	-3.1209
A court said then that it could not be proven that men were actually involved in the bloody absence .	-4.5489
The perpetrators had worn masks and were not recognized .	-1.6396
The Federal Court reapplied the judgment after the revision of the Public Prosecutor 's Office and referred it back to the Court of Justice in order to negotiate it again .	-6.5025
One of the defendants is currently open for execution due to another offence .	-3.1498
First of all , there was the reconstruction of the workshops in the evening .	-4.7369
The Commissioner was loaded as a witness .	-2.2976
The centre was hosted by mobile calls from the accused and other people who had interrogated the police .	-4.5528
Difficult is that rockers almost always abide by the courts - and not say .	-5.4029
This also applies to the victims .	-1.1723
In the first process , only one victim had wrapped .	-2.3062
Public Prosecutor Stefan Gollier said on demand that new traces have appeared since the last procedure .	-4.9410
eleven more days of negotiation are required for the process .	-2.5568
The Weggerland Think Not	-2.0399
The night was long , the music loud and the atmosphere good , but eventually it goes home .	-2.3165
Only : the hunger is noticeable in the trees of people on the front-passenger and rear seat .	-4.5158
Of course one cocktail or sect may be responsible for this !	-2.9678
What is closer to there than to drive to the next one , to treat yourself to a small thing ?	-6.5391
I admit , I am happy to do so when the Fastfood hole goes late or early in the morning .	-5.4635
A few pommes , a Cola , a burger - and then nix as from home and in bed !	-3.9611
But at home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco corners are becoming apparent .	-3.9213
Because what needs to be missing from a steady regularity to throw its fastfood bags out of the auto window ? !	-5.8358
There are exceptionally well-preserved papers on street watches and parking spaces at weekends .	-7.0033
" Why ? " , I ask myself .	-1.0834
Are the people too doof them to take the dust with home with respectively until the next dump ?	-6.5928
It is not just the case that the paper witness is sending the landscape off .	-4.2782
Trained have also covered transport facilities such as guiding schemes , thereby causing accidents .	-6.2878
However , what does not think about what is said " Wegwerfgesellschaft " , it probably does not even know what that word actually means .	-5.8823
If you are travelling on a couple of occasions in the evening , you will know how a rear bank can look like after a staggering nights : ramps , bottles and other rubbish towers .	-8.8517
There would be no more or less nox at all , in contrast to the street , where no one wants to smoke at the food rest of others .	-7.5623
I can already see that the day when cities and communities will be bloated - and the fastfood chains will have to demand pounds for their blossoms .	-6.9682
Obama ’ s Health Readers	-2.5132
After strong criticism , President Obama yesterday offered a retreat to his often-repeated clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-8.1956
After hundreds of thousands of their insurer have received a letter of notice , the Republicans have told the president in recent days that he has missed the American public .	-4.6447
Yesterday , Obama relied on his original promise .	-1.6406
“ The overwhelming majority of citizens with functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-2.7954
In response to the numerous media reports of dismissal , Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance .	-3.4997
In this way , most citizens could receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price , or less projected .	-4.3256
“ You come a better offer , ” he said .	-2.0812
The government called it a little surprise that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance would have to look at a different rate , because their treaty does not meet the new standards according to the Affordable Care Act .	-10.1378
“ I would like to tell these Americans very directly : they deserve better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing before the Washington Energy and Trade Committee .	-4.2702
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , stated that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-2.8441
“ I am as frustrated and angry as all others , ” she said .	-1.7765
I am determined to regain your confidence .	-0.9295
This pronouncement of a sebelius which was raised behind her seated adviser at yesterday 's hearing in the House of Representatives was received after a dispute with Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri , about whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-8.0948
After more than three hours of hearings , Long Sebelius repeatedly urged to ask why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily abandon state-sponsored insurance to withdraw a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which they now want to sell millions of Americans .	-5.3970
The Jerusalem Government does not confirm attack on Syrian air base	-3.0068
An American government official wishing to remain anonymous , on Thursday ’ s US CENN , claimed that Israel ’ s military aircraft had attacked an air base in Syrian Latin America a day earlier .	-6.0289
The objective was ' missiles and associated equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared was intended to have been for Lebanon 's Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-5.0768
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab broadcaster Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the support point in Latakia ’ s port town was bombed on Thursday night by Wednesday , and that Israelis was responsible for it .	-6.1453
Israeli television channels Channel 2 showed satellite images of the support point in Latin where Russian defense rockets were seen from type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometers and warheads can carry up to 70 kilograms .	-5.7144
The Jerusalem government has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.8646
However , the Reuters news agency quotes an equally anonymous Israeli government officer in the words that he believes Israel has run the attack , but is not certain .	-5.4712
A spokesman for the Israeli Ministry of Defence said , in any case , ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.8179
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai stressed in Yedioth Ahronoth ’ s daily newspaper that the Syrian regime has already succeeded , in part , in trying to supply ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-4.1120
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean exceeding a red line that would be followed by a military response .	-2.8505
John Kerry , in an unprecedented admission that America ’ s espionage has “ gone unreasonably far too far . ”	-3.5054
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a revival of the US ’ s defensive stance on its surveillance programs by saying that , in some cases , the spy was “ inappropriate too far . ”	-5.8716
The foreign minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for switching to Autopilot when the explosive revelations of the whistlebuyer Edward Snowden became public about NSA spy activities .	-4.8835
Through the leaked information , the US government has entered a diplomatic storm of disarmament on its allies .	-2.6164
In a speech on the open government conference in London , Kerry said , “ It is no question that the President and I and others in the government have learned of some things that have almost run by autopilot , simply because the ability to do what was left for the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to 11 September . ”	-8.9009
Then , as the first high-level member of the US government , he admitted that the US espionage crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights were abused .	-4.0065
He said : ‘ In some cases , this has gone poorly too far . ’ .	-3.2652
The President is determined to make clarity and is therefore conducting a thorough investigation to ensure that no one has to feel that there is abuse .	-5.8298
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-1.9088
Kerry , however , insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives were saved through its surveillance processes .	-4.0320
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves up . ”	-2.5195
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eager to kill people , blow up the air , and attack governments .	-3.1703
So what would be if we were able to do that and stop before it happens ?	-3.7423
We have , in fact , blocked aircraft crashes , buildings attacks and the murder of people , because we have heard about plans of this kind .	-5.4937
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about alleged American espionage and to persuade Europeans of the need to continue working with the United States on anti-terrorism issues , as the Chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs stated on Thursday .	-5.4579
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he was speaking with representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and was concerned about their threats of not engaging in anti-terror organisations because of the frustration of the surveillance by the National Security Agency .	-5.2176
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board with a view to our joint efforts to combat terrorism , ” Murphy , who , for the first time , is in the Senate as a Democrat and working as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs , stated in an interview in Washington .	-5.7490
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , irrespective of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.5362
Media reports that NSA has gathered millions of phone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , even though the secret service leader announced this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by Nato allies and exchanged with the United States .	-5.8142
Other revelations quoted from Snowden published documents that NSA monitored the mobile by German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-3.7475
The head of the national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended espionage by allies as necessary and declared that it was customary on both sides .	-4.4795
In all of the Tumult , Murphy said that his authority is preparing the Congress to be held this year , and hoped that the delegation will comprise members of both parties and chambers .	-4.8948
The names of the other Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.6593
He said that the exact route is still being prepared .	-2.8832
While Murphy pointed out that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.3938
He said that European governments would have to be honest about the kind of spy programmes they have been using for years .	-3.9197
“ While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect Europeans ’ rights , we must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones who spin , ” Murphy said .	-5.1063
Meanwhile , for John Kerry , a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland stands to grip on America ’ s strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , and US surveillance activities .	-7.2179
A tough violation of the jumping line threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the FSV Mainz 05 German External Action Game at FC Augsburg .	-5.6483
Mainz was involved by Nicolai Müller .	-2.9392
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.2364
So far he has only been able to do this individually .	-2.9139
" We will decide on his commitment in the short term , " said Trainer Thomas Tuchel .	-3.6858
The 40-year-old hopes to have his six-hit pets safeguarded .	-4.6383
Mainzer must already do away with the injured players Niki Zimling , Julian Baumgartlinger and Niko Bungert .	-3.8517
Australia is making appeal against prison sentence in Thailand .	-3.1649
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced in Phuket to 15 days in prison because she wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has been appealed against the sentence and was released on bail .	-5.1833
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false image after having given the Thai police to the indication that a local taxi driver had raped them in the morning hours of Sunday 10 June , while two other men did hold them .	-6.5427
Later , however , the photographs of a video camera showed that she was safely in her hotel after having been separated from her Australian friend .	-8.9056
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they realized their history .	-3.2201
They were in police custody until trial .	-2.6009
Bamford was sentenced to 15-day prison in a low-level prison at the margin of Phuket , instead of being in prison for adult women .	-3.6174
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy-League , who has sent help to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Canberra .	-4.0893
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family is “ extremely worried ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to return to Australia .	-4.0345
“ We are naturally worried about it , but we hope it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.6138
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is free from a 50,000 baht cover .	-4.9019
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime it makes a holiday in Krabi in South Thailand .	-4.0647
Von sides of the court were heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-4.0473
It is also possible , however , that after the recent assassination of the purchasing department , Michelle Smith , in Phuket , Thailand could be attempted to improve its tourist image , and that is why there is no contradiction .	-7.3589
