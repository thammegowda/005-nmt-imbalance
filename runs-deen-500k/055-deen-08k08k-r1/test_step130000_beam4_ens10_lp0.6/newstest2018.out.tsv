A scrap chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now being digged .	-3.4507
Small farmers are managing the former cause of farmers .	-4.3519
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-1.4058
It 's nerved if maps are not up to date .	-2.5176
Everyone who had to get excited is familiar with that , because the car navigation instead of a bypass showed a green meadow .	-6.2032
The historic maps of the Bavarian digital Atlas , an offer by the Geo-portal Bavaria of the state government , are anything but up-to-date - but for that very reason .	-7.7759
Especially when compared to current online maps .	-2.4163
Then it is clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the dissemination area of Münch.	-4.0454
The Bayern Atlas is a patchwork that you do not see as the same .	-4.6143
The large overview map has been compiled for cities and municipalities with more detailed maps , so-called uranium position sheets .	-4.6807
This was created according to the Bavarian Versicherung Management between 1810 and 1864 and the first Bavaria measurement .	-6.2243
Your client : Napoleon .	-0.6352
The French army leader has been occupying Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-3.0855
Napoleon hoped for an overview of the occupied country and ordered a topographical recording of Bavaria for military purposes , of course .	-3.0310
Even though the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunéville from February 9 , 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card .	-4.8077
Kurfürst Max IV. Joseph further pushed the project forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bayerische Versicherung Management .	-4.3698
The location sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like any other on the Bavarian National Library website .	-3.9905
The comparison Spring / Today is most impressing of the country 's capital .	-5.6551
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown up .	-3.3034
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated on the map of 1856 .	-2.3353
Sendling was inaugurated 21 years after the creation of the card , in 1877 , as a city in Munich .	-4.6972
Today , Untersendling is in the middle of the city .	-2.7017
The houses of Untersendlings are located around 1856 along today 's Plinganserstraße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser only in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian Farmers ’ insurrection against Austria in 1705 .	-5.3341
Where the Western Park is today , there is nothing to be seen as a field - at first glance : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten , numbered rings from the so-called " original " from which the property tax was derived .	-8.0007
Small parcels there are no longer farmers there , but small gardens of the " Land in Sun " facility .	-5.2854
A large green area is located north of Untersendling .	-1.8917
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the site of Oktoberfest , was indeed a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-4.0174
On the other side of the Isar , the historic map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.0873
In the Urposition Blatt , in the region of today 's Au-Haidhausen district , not only read the street name " at the Gasteig " or the hill " On the Lifts " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-6.9375
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstraße you used to locate people with dashes .	-4.9112
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Kreis-Irrenlant " On the Auer Lüften " was born .	-3.7747
As of 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-4.5171
" He was progressing for his time and ended , for example , the chains of the so-called mistakes .	-6.4272
In addition , he forbidden the personnel to use violence against the inmates , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt .	-8.4007
280 patients initially had space , later to be expanded to 500 places .	-4.6473
At some point , this capacity no longer existed - the reason for the construction of the district vintage in Haar 1905 .	-4.4476
Since 2006 , Isar-Amper-Knikum München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrics , is located there .	-6.4873
In the former Auer Anstalt area , young people are now in the Münchner Salesianum .	-3.7439
Order bought the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-5.8743
Westlich lies TSV München Ost , east residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.8543
In 2015 , the “ Casa Don Bosco ” Children ’ s House was built in an architectural approach to the origins of the Irrenalt , which had been destroyed during World War II during bombing .	-6.6898
The Marienplatz was recorded around 1856 as " Main Square " , the " Kaufinger Gasse " was named .	-5.0961
The Second World War also brought a significant change in the heart of Munich .	-1.9206
Allied bombs risen many holes to the city centre in December 1944 .	-2.4343
A big stay until today - at the Marienhof .	-3.8149
The English Institute , small businesses , and a chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof , where the preliminary works and on 5 April 2017 at the Spartensstick for the second S-Bahn railway line .	-10.9729
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with today 's aerial image - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.8503
Missouri Citizens ' Rights Group published travel warning	-2.1130
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri on the basis of the discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.5059
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and Missouri to pay particular attention and extreme caution when travelling by the state , as a number of questionable , race-based incidents are occurring in the entire state and are recorded here , " says it in the opinion of the group .	-7.5261
A recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes people more difficult to win acts of discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that target minorities disproportionately , led the group to issue the warning of travel , said NAACP .	-5.5118
" You have violations of the civil rights that happen to people .	-2.8280
They are persisted for their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-2.8937
'We are hearing complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . '	-2.1638
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued to a state in the US .	-2.5661
The group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.2690
Sanders died in questionable circumstances early this year , after he had no petrol during his trip by the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri without being accused of any crime .	-5.6186
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Attorney General ’ s Office , which shows that black drivers in the state will be held 75 % more frequently than white .	-4.9424
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " Chapel said .	-2.8266
" People need to be willing to bring in cash or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-4.1263
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures in the FBI ’ s Hasscrimes program , which classified the state as regards the number of such injuries to the 16th rank of the country .	-4.7051
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.7916
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws obliging local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for violations of immigration , which , in the view of the ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.1230
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently stakeholders have deployed the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.3212
Weidezaur Project is elementary .	-2.4807
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.0919
The CDU employees Peter White and Kordula Kovac have got a picture on the spot .	-6.8870
At the Schwendemann family ’ s Right Grabenhof , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .	-5.0583
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his operation in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows , as well as many jungments and in five apartments accommodates guests .	-5.6631
The Black Forest milk is , for him , an alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , Schwendemann .	-8.6806
The holiday table consists of only regional dishes .	-4.9011
Since he is also BLHV Chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaun project " fundamental important " .	-7.9211
I cannot make such sharp surfaces profitable .	-2.6586
The green surface provides much work , much work needs to be done with the engine sensor .	-4.8249
" We are fighting with the conditions and with the topography " , emphasized Schwendemann .	-3.9913
In 2003 he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not lead a biomass operation .	-4.8363
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the Weidezaun project and is happy about leather support " .	-4.8836
Farmers would have to be supported at the cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare .	-2.3422
It is hoped that this could go beyond the afforestation of the area for a long time .	-5.4091
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to get their business further " , the mayor stressed .	-5.2753
Farmers stand in criticism often because of the promotion of support .	-4.4116
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were imported via grass production .	-5.3618
The revenue area thus stands at 40 hectares , which cannot be reformed until at least 2023 .	-4.3758
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half of the Leader was promoted , a quarter bore the municipality of Fischerbach .	-4.7602
The farmers left EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Widezaun .	-4.2213
" The big advantage is the durability of the fence , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.5668
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a really good job , without farmers and farms it is not " .	-4.0541
Peter Weiß also stated : " The best food produced here " .	-4.4954
The Landscape Care Guidelines ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state support for pasta fences .	-5.2180
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.0122
The condition is that a cult of support referred to by the LPR is present .	-6.2847
Moreover , the area in which it is to be imported must not be sloppy manageable ( hiding over 35 % ) and must be threatened with afforestation .	-7.1752
For the 2018 Fischerbacher Weidezaun project , the request for eight participants with 24 parcels is now running , with about 16 kilometres of fence .	-6.1525
The revenue area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are over EUR 112 000 .	-3.1623
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.7281
Now , the Trump White House is embracing the Statue of Liberty	-2.6974
The safest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-1.8412
The Americans appreciate them as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.1848
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axis in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the status of freedom .	-5.2616
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.8009
A horde of boatowners and liberty imitators would have loved him if he had done so .	-4.0962
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance it attached when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-4.1988
As Miller Acosta complained : " I do not want to go into a whole thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-3.8465
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Freedom . '	-2.9942
Miller is right , but as he put it himself , it is not really a matter of history .	-2.9877
It is about the contemporary resonance of the upset words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrant , but the poorest of the poor : " Your troubles , your poor , / your afflicted crowd , which then yearn to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your coasts . "	-6.9780
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " on our screens was better seen .	-3.2826
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump ’ s US are not welcome .	-2.1034
This conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict of America 's importance .	-4.3537
Lazarus - and her friends who advocated placing their words on the base after their death - knew very well that they undertook a highly political act .	-4.5693
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a sewn classic picture .	-4.7599
Lazarus changed that meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-2.7788
And it gives itself a very different name : mother of the exile .	-3.6095
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-1.9374
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people from the right have long wanted to change it .	-3.4134
The great Rush Limbaigh , a kind of Trump ’ s debtor Johannes , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame to the around world : " Lady Liberty is moving ahead .	-6.7518
It should bear the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .	-5.2040
The torch does not want to go down the road to the United States ' .	-3.7449
Unusually , Limbaurg has encountered something here .	-3.8836
The significance of the statue is absolutely a question of the point of view of perception .	-2.9571
The great imagination of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by exhausted , miserable , but hopeful people after long and often dreadful trips on the decks of ships .	-7.4627
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-4.0851
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the will they have to hear .	-3.0745
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.3471
Their torch is intended not to enlighten the path , but to destroy the hatred that is their only source of power .	-4.1040
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team .	-2.1668
Eilidh Doyle recalls a time when only two Scots were a British team .	-2.3870
The performance director of the United Kingdom ’ s athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Cup will make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-9.8347
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.5607
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and the UK 's track athletics must learn something from it .	-4.3045
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it out , " said Black .	-1.9925
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.6381
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.7736
British athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2624
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.0318
Whatever the combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant ' .	-1.5853
Several of Scottish athletes are Medaillen Anwarmers , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who are going to compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by team captain .	-5.3182
" Eilidh is fairly modest .	-1.8692
Their speech on skies was incredible , " says Black .	-2.9131
" A series of athletes , no matter whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-3.5206
The passion and real feeling , which Eilidh naturally brought , were great ' .	-4.0447
The Commonwealth Silver medal winner who will compete with the 400m barriers in their fifth World Championships says it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.6929
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.3783
The intermediary route , Muir , is along this road and has set five British and two European records last year .	-4.7865
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m arrows .	-3.1544
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and Anniversary Games .	-4.4312
Doyle is reminiscent of her first world championships when the only other Scot was in the team Lee McConnell .	-3.0799
The team captain says that she is ' enormously proud ' on the fact that many of her compatriots are not only team but , in some cases , also in the medals and in the finals .	-5.8184
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was in any case a great honour , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , making it a very special thing for me , " she added .	-5.1948
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team .	-1.5020
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.5626
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb to podiums .	-3.4171
As regards my speech as Captain ?	-2.2587
Yes , I think she went good .	-1.1359
I just mentioned that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .	-4.0197
So it is really important to rely on this heating support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.3758
I have a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there ' .	-3.6580
Facebook critics are blocking : Don ’ t beat a public office if you can ’ t hide voters .	-5.4828
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.7992
The Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-3.5050
He marched safely in the criticism .	-3.3570
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.0538
For in 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be dismissed - and , stupid and stupid , as the sheep are led to battles ' .	-4.6610
That brings me to Maryland to Larry Hogan Governor , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.5538
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and cleared the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .	-6.0133
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week .	-2.8317
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as a fresh people , and the online commentary was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-4.4021
" It 's only Facebook " , said many people .	-1.9527
But it is important .	-0.5897
And it is especially important if it is a type like hogan .	-2.7150
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state .	-1.8685
He has the second highest approval of the 50 nation governors .	-2.0246
Hogan is not a reactionary Hitzhead .	-4.7406
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict observance of the principles .	-3.0169
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect to his constituents and playfully unleash his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-4.5793
That is why the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor is a public forum which is known as an official forum and of staff paid with public tax dollars is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-8.9936
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than modernization .	-2.9085
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hatred people who swing online .	-3.9792
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-1.7960
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a parish , no trolls .	-3.0593
You all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , not profane .	-3.1667
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.6349
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hassled , but she asked for hate crimes .	-3.3159
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the news news coverage " The Post " .	-3.3034
" I do not appreciate this idea even if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some people tend to disregard it as a so-called collective effort and not recognise it as a large group of affected citizens ' .	-6.7409
What the governor ’ s employees called the “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call it “ language . ”	-4.8318
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.8538
It is much cleaner than in the past if you had done the same thing that staff were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical key articles , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-4.4263
But that is what is happening digitally .	-1.8333
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for using Facebook and other social media .	-2.6419
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter Feed .	-2.6917
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-1.1646
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she denied a constituent from her Facebook side .	-4.1390
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.6142
It should not be so difficult .	-1.4605
At the moment Washington had a similar impact on the Internet as the affordable porto .	-5.1858
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters encouraged his leadership .	-2.9157
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2050
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belarus " and " Portius " wrote all letters of newspapers that Washington ’ s decisions were written .	-4.1213
Petitions that criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity , trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .	-8.2880
But he did not silence them .	-1.0963
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-2.1353
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.3481
Ronan Raffty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club .	-3.0015
Former Europeans , Nr. 1 Ronan Rfferty , will hope for home comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th issue of Scottish Senior Open .	-5.5774

The English Emales is looking forward to defending a Championship for the first time , although he won his 32-year career both at the European Tour and at the European Challenge Tour .	-5.1872

Gary Orr , who was a European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to the action on homeland .	-4.9368
This event will be its first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-2.2059
" It always means a little more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.1642
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .	-2.6612
I really enjoyed playing it again , and I played a solid golf .	-2.1887
I am pleased with the way in which things have gone . '	-3.6303
The trio in the field is the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .	-3.9888

Passive smoking ’ s Less Pavive Cancer Materials	-3.4947
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking on lung cancer .	-2.5829
This result is a study by scientists of the Hamburg Eppendorf University Clinic ( UKE ) in .	-3.8650
" According to our estimates , 167 cases of lung cancer are due to passive smoking each year , " said Leader Heiko Becher .	-2.8122
He went through his own study in 1994 on this subject .	-3.7426
Back then , there were 400 lung cancer deaths per year for passive smoking . were in Germany .	-6.8779
The new inquiry is published in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-1.6346
Homegrown Banks prove complex	-4.2224
The works on the Villinger Strasse are full and " lie in time " , according to the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-5.4527
In the area of home requests , the situation is more complicated than assumed , because there is a lot to hide , which is not mentioned in the plans .	-5.8428
The traffic which constantly hinders construction work is a major problem for the Stumpp building force .	-4.5676

The former carpenter secured 27 of the 29 Papua districts - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.1420

" Our hearts have broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , expecting that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.2176

On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out of the ground and sang Christmas songs against a warehouse in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-4.8265
The shocked children told them that they should turn on their headlights .	-2.8123
One of the soldiers took offense at their tone and later came back with four soldiers , the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-3.6800
The soldiers who had drunk were hunting and swallowed the group with their swords , said victims and witnesses .	-8.0218
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.6073
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeiro , was beaten so hard to fall into the coma .	-3.3038
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set to fire and things escalated the next day .	-3.2036
Around 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered in a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military commando centre to demand justice .	-3.4815
They wore ceremonial hunting bows and led the Waita dance - running in the circle and imitating a bird singing - from Papuas Mee Pago .	-4.8548
Some demonstrators began to muzzle police and military posts .	-6.0421
When the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers about an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot it dead , " it is said in an official document of TIME that was not released to the local media .	-4.5972
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , Head of the Kego Koto Quarter of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for peace and demanded the amount to return home .	-3.7304
Nobody was listening in the mood .	-1.3961
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my leftist handgesture , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .	-3.6210
Kayame still doesn 't know who has fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-3.6319

According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured .	-1.7898
The news about the killings came only the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta .	-1.7544
Three weeks , Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura , expressing sympathy for the families of the victims , and sworn to address historical abuses in Papua .	-3.8893
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen anymore in the future , " he said .	-2.4455
Security Secretary Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations .	-3.6849
But the excuses started almost immediately .	-1.0698
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.5186
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 ’ s .	-2.0291
The point is that we have undertaken to address these violations , but there are processes that need to be passed , " he said .	-3.6221
Then , Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua .	-3.5788
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-1.9362
Wiranto , which the UN has accused of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been settled , including the Paniai event .	-4.8062
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with great indecision .	-4.7112
" I was interviewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.6157
'I am tired ' .	-1.5966
He says he still lives in fear years later .	-2.3665
" I am afraid " he says .	-1.3972
" I am afraid of being arrested by the military , is fear to be shot . "	-3.3389
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.3827
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.4577
" After I buried the body , the military sought me , " he says .	-2.4456
The shooting has not stopped .	-2.4507
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police arrested villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood of Deiyai .	-3.1262
During confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.0307
The man who drowned in a nearby river 24-year Ravianus Douw died on his way to hospital .	-3.5573
Established villagers protested at the company 's location office .	-3.2620
The police said that the villagers were throwing stones on officers who responded by firing warning boxes .	-3.5228
But locals say that the mobile Brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot the quantity and kill one .	-3.6958
" We were so panic , we fear that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who was staying close to the hospital and witness how the injured here was quickly delivered , according to TIME .	-4.2697
" I hidden myself two days in my house . "	-2.4116
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held accountable and for withdrawing the mobile police brigades from the area .	-2.9431
Paniai has always been a source of trouble for the Indonesian government .	-3.4473
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members of Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the Papua ’ s green plate. are , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.9683
Many of them joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the Papua 's rights by initiating sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.9474
Some of Paniai ’ s top OPM leaders , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudes Kogoya .	-4.4924
In response to this , in recent years , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arrested arbitrarily , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.4088
Some do not appear again .	-1.9795
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as a " tragic and forgotten place " .	-2.8897
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.3238
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.9411
Brot is just as well beyond reach .	-3.0747
People here are building everything they eat : nota and fruit and shelfish .	-7.4419
Agriculture is the job of women who can work four or five fields of sweet potatoes each .	-3.6910
They keep most of the harvest for the family while the rest is being sold on the local market .	-2.7322
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-5.3716
Economic inequalities have grown over time between the local Papua and the new migrants , who have reached a greater number since the opening of new routes to the Nabire Airport .	-4.7705
The few jobs in the region typically go to the more educated and prosperous migrants .	-2.3289
Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to make their own companies competitive .	-2.8596
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money " , says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribal council .	-3.7204
isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.5484
Furthermore , restrictions on reporting international media remain tense .	-2.4246
Earlier this year , French journalists , Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp , were deported for lack of coordination with Papua related institutions , despite the rare permission to film .	-4.3458
According to Phelim Kine , Human Rights Watch ’ s Deputy Director of Asia , Jokowi ’ s campaign ’ s pledges to lift the reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development were not realized .	-4.3303
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia 's most unsettled provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-4.2765
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papuas .	-3.1144
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread injuries ' in Papua including the Paniai Schieerei .	-3.9193
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.3925
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir reprimanded the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.9683
The people on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-4.9653
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on 4 May , under the leadership of the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , locals broke their silence and pressed him " We want freedom " , according to a source which also participated in the sitting but wishes to remain anonymous .	-5.6361
Indonesia will have another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.7737
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai-Schüssen " , says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-4.8232
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from the constant threat of a predatory military , are living in poor education and health services .	-3.1139
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , see their vote for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must pay back .	-7.5376
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.1524
Despite the threats and intimidations , Paniai ’ s shoe victims led to a final symbolic act of the trot : the body of a victim was buried in a field precisely against the police and the military station .	-6.0738
You know that they may never be given justice , but at least let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.5740

Fire captures the Torch 'cloud scratch of Dubai for the second time .	-3.0910
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world ’ s highest residential towers in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 metre-high 79 storey buildings .	-4.3885
It is the second fire that blows the high house in just two years , which is accidentally called the Torch Tower ( Fackel Tower ) .	-5.5428
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.1701
" We slept and we were up for fire alarm and cries of people .	-3.9290
We ran the stairs down and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " a resident who called George told Reuters .	-3.5614
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units erupted the fire and cooled the building at 4.00 p.m.	-3.9648
The government said it was working to provide accommodation to those affected .	-2.9316
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in outer areas of high houses around the world .	-4.2403
An inquiry carried out by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the congestion , exterior congestion to decoration or isolation .	-5.5412
In the UK , the police said that the system of plates for isolation and paralysis at the London Grenfell tower could have contributed to the rapid expansion of a fire that killed around 80 people .	-5.2327
No Davis Cup reform : Continue Best-of-Five	-2.0311
The President of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) fell through with his large Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-3.3095
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individual was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-3.6922
This is often very long , but also very esteemed , five saddle classics remain in the traditional market .	-8.4057
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of the reform , which is why ITF President David Haggerty ’ s objective was therefore just missed .	-4.7597
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members did not accept the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.7513
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.6459
We will continue to work to improve the candidates .	-2.4562
It is not the time to vote , after many objections , that the proposal was to carry out the final in a neutral place .	-5.8360

More than 1 out of 5 US travellers publish forbidden items in the aircraft , find a survey	-5.7778
A survey among airline passengers revealed that more than 20 percent of deliberately or unconsciously forbidden items in the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points are dirty , including at least 6 % of the aircraft , while they accidentally wore forbidden knives or other items .	-7.1031
Less than 1 % claimed that they were late to discover that they were mistaken with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.5675
The survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also noted that younger travellers are more likely to disregard the rules .	-4.4878
Of the respondents who admit that they knowingly tried to fly with something banned by TSA , 19.7 % Millennials were Millennials , compared to less than 15 % , members of generation X were .	-3.8005
The most common items deliberately passed on to TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.7121
More than 3 % admitted to have undergone knowledgeable objects with blades through safety control , while 2.2 % of women surveyed and 3.7 % of male surveyed also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs into the aircraft .	-6.6668
The company said that it consulted travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods had brought through airport security and how many people had done it deliberately .	-5.0674
It is no surprise that the people who have been the most vengeable - knowledgeable or ignorant - bear the safety of those who fly most often .	-6.5628
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-1.8792
People are often unsure what liquids they can take or how much of them .	-2.9824
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids banned by the TSA are .	-4.0360
For a time , people who TSA could see books as smuggling goods .	-2.8007
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.9647
Elon Musk is no : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order	-3.4141
Elon Musk is pleased to announce the new " Model 3 " electro-thousands sassa Elon Musk .	-5.3858
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-3.9866
In addition to the triumphant figures on sales and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla ’ s head , Elon Musk , has for the first time revealed another , less glossy number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-6.2167
In recent months , Musk had often acquired more than 500,000 preorder orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-6.8064
Now , Musk admits : 518,000 preorder orders have already withdrawn 63,000 .	-3.2289
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.5329
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 Euros ( USD 1000 and GBP 1000 in the United Kingdom ) .	-4.8526
Currently there are 455,000 such non-binding reservations , Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.0968
The Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of some twelve percent of all orders could be a problem .	-4.9054
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-2.5043
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.1703
In 2018 , all models taken together should be 500,000 , a million in 2020 .	-3.4156
There is an obvious demand for that .	-1.9048
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations .	-2.6544
Anyone who is today ordering a " Model 3 " can expect extradition at the earliest stage in the second half of 2018 if Tesla manages to travel its new , untested production routes without major interruptions with maximum utilisation .	-6.3061
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.5742
If , however , there are major delays , then the imperfect nature of the reserves could become the problem for Tesla .	-4.5623
Because then the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from slipping out .	-5.1148
EPA ’ s Chief of Pruitt is drawing back because of the delay in the Obama Era rules on reducing emissions .	-4.8496
One day after having been sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Authority , took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama-era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog .	-4.9410
Pruitt presented change when his agency proved to the needs of state environmental authorities in a more responsive manner than previous administrations .	-4.7822
He did not mention the complaint against his previous place in a federal court .	-3.6212
It is a deadline for States to meet the 2015 standards for soil ozone on 1 October .	-4.0373
In June , Pruitt announced that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time , study the plan , and avoid ' interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth ' .	-3.9748
Pruitt , who was Oklahoma ’ s prosecutor before he was appointed by President Donald Trump , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental legislation .	-3.4595
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly gone to block or delay regulations that defy the chemical industry and fossil fuels .	-3.3596
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-1.8719
Last month , a Federal Appeal Court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane lecks .	-5.1960
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his U-turn in ozone standards simply strengthens EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of fulfilling the new standards in time .	-4.3434
" Under previous administrations , the EPA often did not meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in agreement to set the deadline for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sold the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-5.0944
" We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.6541
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously ' .	-1.9488
Nonetheless , the EPA 's opinion stated that Pruitt will at some point use its ' prerogative to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on sound policies and the best available information ' .	-6.1365
Congressional Republicans are urging a broader recast of the ozone rules .	-2.2932
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.4160
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.2851
The New York Attorney General , Eric Schneiderman , who chaired the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-7.3200
" The reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is a major gain in health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that moves into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-5.5305
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington District of Columbia .	-1.9272
Boden-Ozon occurs when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .	-3.2796
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .	-3.0351
Public health officials and environmentalists cherished a surprising change of course through Pruitts .	-4.5745
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to take this sensible step from the person responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-2.9468
" We must continue to fight against the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to address polluters and their special interests " .	-3.0560
Tumlingen celebrates 750 years of St. Hilarius Church .	-1.8088
750 years St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old Friedhof area in Tumlingen on Sunday , July 16 , will be invited to a serenade at 16.	-4.7311
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the village , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-4.6547
The visitors of the Sixth Benefit area can be enchanted by this powerful village .	-7.3408
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made Tumlings and Fonderers their concern .	-4.9836
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique local jewel " .	-2.0588
In 1267 , the St. Hilarius chapel was first mentioned in the Württembergisch Book of Doctors : Graf Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the ensuing parish church on Tumlingen and the Voggei " to Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-5.9551
According to the document , on the Tumlinger mountain , other than the former parish church , there was also a wonderful courtyard belonging to the church or to the patron law and not vice versa .	-7.2729
People were therefore inhabited .	-3.0195
As emerged from the description of the Oberament Freudenstadt in 1858 , alongside the underground and the Oberdorf , which is still to be seen in the town picture of Tumlingen , the " mountain " of the third , the dominant village centre .	-6.2774
Old maps from the time around the year 1600 underpin these historical realities .	-4.3229
The right of patronage was derived from early medieval own church law .	-4.4068
A Lord who built , fitted and occupied a parish , remained the owners of this church and could also inherit this church .	-5.0428

Three old ones existed in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.3635
The sizes of the two crumbled on Christmas 1673 .	-3.2129
The new bell was erected for the first time in 1692 , but later had to be handed over in 1942 during World War II .	-5.2736
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) , the window discs were cut and the bell silk was stolen .	-3.8342
The roof was impenetrable .	-1.9578
In 1796 , French troops were held near the church .	-2.3215
They broke out the candles and church chairs and used them as distillery .	-4.2332
The remains of the church were threatened to plunge in 1809 .	-2.8190
Until 1869 , Tumlinger Hillarius-Friedhof also served as the last retirement for the deaths of Auerschweiler .	-5.4460
In 1823 the graveyard was extended and the hillary church was broken .	-3.7421
Only the church tower was left .	-2.9984
In 1834 , a storm split the church tower and half crashed .	-2.2533
The tower was abandoned to prevent any accident .	-2.9409
Only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-3.4273

Association wants to verify permission for wind turbines	-3.2058
" Boisheim refuses to " sees no legal precondition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Country Council .	-4.8675
The " Boisheim defends " association called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in Boisheimer Net.	-4.5007
It would be unlawful .	-2.5057
The association argues that at the time of its approval on 30 December 2016 at Boisheimer Nette no wind power plants could have been approved , as at the time in Viersen only a wind concentration zone existed on the city border at Schwalmtal .	-10.7029
The construction and operation of wind power plants is generally possible within this concentration zone , but the concentration zone also causes the exclusion of wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-5.6291
Such areas should prevent the paralysis of the landscape .	-2.8981
The city of Viersen , although a few days earlier , amended the land use plan , adopted a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette - but the district government did not authorise Düsseldorf because of a formula .	-7.1418
" Due to the lack of a planning legal condition , the authorisation document granted is still illegal and therefore withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim defends himself " .	-6.4558
The current state of affairs : before the summer break the wind concentration zone in Boisheimer Nette has once again been decided ; the district government is still authorised .	-6.7349
Drawing : ' In this regard , authorisation for the construction of wind energy installations is legally excluded from planning law ' .	-5.9729
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.5219
" The corresponding letters have been addressed to the district of Viersen since last week , " a speaker explained .	-4.2898
The circle has taken it to investigate the matter again .	-3.8841
They are not likely to stop the process .	-3.2130
In view of current procedures at the administrative court , the circle did not want to comment on the content of the arguments of the Boisheim Association on Thursday .	-6.2422
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four wind wheels per 200 metres high on the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.6587
Already last year the company , in which the city of Viersen is indispensable , had concluded leasing contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .	-4.8573
The aim of the four wind power plants is to meet the electricity requirements of around 11 400 households , which is roughly a fifth of the electricity requirements of all four four thousand households .	-6.0730
NEW Re intends to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.8378
Last summer , Foursen ’ s Municipality gave the green light to the purchase of three wind turbines at Linnich near Aachen , as well as participation in a wind turbine facility in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the region .	-6.1039

As the Chairman of the Gewerbeverein , Christian King , has announced , the " Homehold Shop " weekend should raise the awareness of the customers of their own city beyond the usual supermarket commodity .	-7.2958
Thus a market with regional suppliers is planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.0062
In addition , local companies should present themselves with their training places .	-3.4663
In addition , downtown shops are to be invited to the Midnight Stop .	-5.3608
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the nearer region .	-4.9383

In addition , customer potential should be reopened or reopened .	-3.4152
These include tourist guests .	-3.2860
But many locals , too , would have lost sight of the city centre .	-3.3802
In the end , everyone would have to help to revitalise the city centre - to rent , to the farms of the whole city and to clubs .	-6.3604
King said in spring that it would be possible to overcome the lethargy with a network that had developed .	-6.0311
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen , said that in the country , the third " home " -day , for the first time involved five Thuringian cities .	-6.1737
Besides Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-3.5093
The day should ' advertise for the appreciation of local trade and show its importance to the common good of our cities ' , go so far .	-5.0672
The IHK action and many partners also make it clear that every citizen , with his purchasing behavior , can influence his direct environment himself .	-4.4043

Trump pressed for leaked transcription of phone calls to Mexico for borderline payments	-7.7566
Transcription of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia was published by the Washington Post .	-2.2849
On 27 January , Trump , in a phone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , asked to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.9703
The US President complained because he publicly denounced the wall , and he reportedly said to him : ' You cannot tell the press ' .	-4.3146
Trump launched his presidential campaign to build a wall on the southern US border , sworn to pay Mexico for the project .	-3.3939
Transcription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbul was also published and revealed an exciting exchange .	-2.7916
Mr. Trump said Mr Turnbull that a trade for the US would take refugees who emigrated to Australia ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence of trade passed by the Obama administration would look like a ' deadlock ' after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.8618
Mr Trump ended the call after Mr Turnbul said , " that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.9100
Moores Ford massacres : Activists resume racist lynchact as an appeal for justice .	-4.0057
A 1948-tier Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rested on the Moore Ford Bridge .	-4.9634
Before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver to reach the bridge , a group of white men met with guns to block his way .	-2.8466
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windscreen .	-4.6765
In the morning , the inmates were scared .	-6.9003
" We want this n ---r Roger ! " The man rushed .	-3.4414
" Get him out of the car ! "	-2.4323
Schreie grasp the silence when a young black man was crushed by the front-passenger seat .	-3.7555
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a copy .	-2.5938
But when a nozzle is thrown around the " Roger " neck , almost all of the audience turned out to be very real sightseeing .	-6.3992
Since 2005 , citizens ' rights have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to celebrate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.4965
Nobody was ever charged for murder .	-1.9466
" It is really incomprehensible that in all these years no one person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organise the presentation .	-4.9731
" It is a dirty spot on a history , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.1976
Brooks is a former Georgian Congress ’ s 71 year old state and a lifelong civil rights activist .	-3.9260
For him , the post serves as a dramatic call for action , and an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.9676
" We want prosecution , we want an end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we need to get justice , " he said .	-2.8002
" We cannot heal and reconciliation until we receive justice . "	-2.3468
A court medical scientist puts a check on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynchen on 27 July 1946 .	-5.8895
According to FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lyn process .	-2.5836
But no one was ever prosecuted .	-1.7968
Although the suspects have remained open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .	-4.1613
In April 1946 , a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia for the first time to vote in the summer campaign .	-3.6834
About at the same time as the election , according to the FBI of the Black Farm-Master Roger Malcom stayed a white property owner , Barnett Hester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman .	-4.9888
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slaughtered with Malcoms Mrs Dorothy and that the baby she was carrying was not from her husband .	-4.2625
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison , the FBI .	-10.7597
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.7025
But when they distracted from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-4.2944
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings , " hereafter concludes an FBI report .	-3.8330
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses " .	-3.4208
Brooks makes it even more concise .	-1.8816
" It was an electoral law massacre , " he said .	-1.6158
" You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you register and if you vote , that will happen to you . "	-3.8144
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has directed the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders ’ annual posture .	-6.3350
Their narrative is illustrative , elaborate , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that he no longer exists in America .	-5.6522
It is hard to watch and look even more difficult , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.4292
" We do not want to talk about the lynch , because we are then confronted with its hypocrisy in all of us , " she said .	-4.9946
" But I can not build a relationship with you if you don 't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.0426
The samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - pressed into one room and heard when Greene started a well-designed overview of the play .	-5.7616
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-director .	-2.3700
He has played the role of head clan for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-2.8104
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.2302
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times " .	-2.2728
On the other side of the room , the actors Darius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , the Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester played their lines .	-2.6961
The piece begins with Malcom , who touches and affects him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.5930
" I said n -- he , disappear from my property ! "	-2.1893
Rascona reproduces the fire .	-1.7280
There is a break .	-0.5939
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in revenge .	-3.1350
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.0503
" What ? ! " , asked Rascona .	-1.9112
It is alarming and confusing .	-1.3014
Was I too harsh ?	-1.4843
" No " , Greene said , still kicking .	-2.0968
" I just do not think that white people at the time ' n -- he ' said . . . ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !	-6.7414
" But " , one of the other black actors witnessed .	-2.7834
'You just have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-4.9226
And that is where energy shifts in the room , a sense of friendship replaces the unease .	-4.1188
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.0416
The scene begins again .	-1.8983
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharp and strong .	-2.7034
Nobody is really laughing .	-5.7061
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.9208
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.9759
A woman who is dressed with a dreams dress , stands on the corpses of the actors and performs Billie Holiday 's dreamy praise " Strange Fruit " .	-7.6680
Your voice breaks at every second word .	-2.3081
About a hundred metres behind this , a group of about four dozen spectators is watching sweat and tears out of sight .	-4.3942
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.4145
A couple is travelling from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many get down the road only .	-4.2184
They have experienced all almost eight hours of depression in Georgia when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage trip to the tombs of Malcom and Dorsey .	-5.0834
Up to that point , the killings have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand on the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels splendid .	-4.8734
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites you to get closer and inspire the body name .	-3.4313
Children watch at their heads , register fake blood and silent body and whisper .	-4.1127
" You are not really dead , " mumbles a little boy , as he would remember .	-3.5924
After a few minutes , Greene thanks the quantity - and suddenly it is over .	-2.5927
The actors discard the lynchral and wipe their tears .	-4.5351
Bradshaw disturbs Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the Clan member .	-4.7317
Nick Rascona rounds two of his co-actors and then breaks together in their poor , the emotional burden of performance breaks with him .	-5.8152
" It is okay " , one of the women smiles .	-3.9163
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.0736
You did this for one reason ' .	-2.3126
Later , the audience joined the actors to dinner .	-2.9735
At a table a white couple from Atlanta revolves around the descendancy with a black couple that they have just .	-5.4089
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the feeling of performance .	-3.6360
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and do this because they look like you , " she said .	-2.6462
" What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynch is still going on , " she added , " Today it is called the only police chief " .	-5.7658
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Court holds his table , eating and reminding citizens ' rights .	-3.0228
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .	-2.6103
" The post is somewhat inspiring , because she describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.0575
" It is like not learning from it , then it can happen again .	-3.4751
Anyone who does not study his own history is condemned to repeat it . '	-3.1442
Divine Dawn Reconciled the Wagner in Bayreuth	-3.0289
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , Director Frank Castorf insists on a colourful and fresh production of gigantic , six-story scenery .	-5.3252
The rotary stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) displays a shabby street corner including Mauerrest and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " Plaste and Elaste " logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-6.0983
Before this , a Mercedes-Oldtimer parks in which the Rhine Fathers stand as Rockergirls , or alternatively an Isetta .	-5.0819

There is great applause for the festival orchestra , which for the first time shows itself on stage - in view of the large heat again in leger leisure clothes .	-5.7056
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his directorial team had been expected with tension .	-5.2079
If he had to leave a yellow arrow concert in 2013 , five years later , there were great signs in which the “ buh ” reputation was lost .	-7.8587
Festspichefin Katharina Wagner should have been delighted with this .	-3.3136
" One realizes that the audience has grown in a way with the " ring " , she had said just before performing the dpa .	-5.1701
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but also gained an understanding of its view .	-4.4437

President Donald Trump ’ s administration has attempted to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump is supposed to boost economic growth .	-3.7956
The efforts have , however , triggered the setback of the Democrats and conservation groups , which worry about the effects of greater emissions on public health .	-4.7972

Municipality wants to see a community area . a in , , , , , , , ,	-4.8789
In the end , the decision was clear : if there were two votes against , the Council of Fluorn-Winzeln decided to set up a Community area in the future Senior Residence .	-4.4847
There is important information before the discussion : the purchase contract for the property that is still missing is signed , the mayor Bernhard Tjades reports .	-5.5145
It will take some time before the area of the parish hitherto belonging to the church , but there is no longer any barrier to planning for the project to be run by a private investor .	-6.0196
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-2.1607
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to come to the community .	-2.7374
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with 70 square meters of space for a special price .	-3.6287
The administration and the majority of the council stipulates that such a common area should not be a meeting point for the inhabitants of the senior housing , but an open community .	-7.1041
As an example , the word " Strickcafé " made the round .	-3.0481
Add to this funding , which was decided by allocating funds to the current budget last autumn , by means of funding .	-5.6733
The building is situated in the residential area .	-3.3446
In other words , the establishment of a Community area would be equivalent to Tjades , with 60 % of 30 % eligible .	-5.2242
The proposal for a resolution seeks to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a straw between his legs in this respect , which states that both the saddle - which is directed towards the development of the environment - and also the pult roof - which reduces the amount of grain and the construction of economic power - would be possible .	-9.9741
Unnecessary , it is not just Wilfried Sohmer that means this .	-3.3436
When it helps : unanimously happens the body .	-2.9138

Daniela reputation refers to the many own buildings with which we do not go rather far , for which we reject the common space from the window , she says : " I am going hard with it " .	-7.6606
Yvonne Staier is very much in favour of the Community area , but absolutely against communal participation .	-3.8250
It sees a hidden subsidy to already fortunate , or even foreign , investors .	-4.8177
That is not the case , because if the area is acquired it is not given an allowance , but it gets a real item that can be marketed , in doubt , is the counter-speech .	-8.2457
There are three advocates for Staiger ’ s proposal to divide the resolution accordingly .	-3.8130
It therefore remains with the original programme , which Mr Haller summarises : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.2573

Hiking the Harz of Stern	-1.5498
In the Harz region the first " Star Path " is to be developed throughout the country .	-5.3224
The club Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this evening .	-3.5038
Göttingen has been a planetary route since 2003 .	-4.2044
A " Star Path " meets the need for information from many harvest visitors , it was said .	-5.6076
It combines nature , science , movement and sports performance .	-1.7603
Members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-3.9787
In a first phase until 2018 , the club plans " easy to achieve installations in five to six places " in the Oberharz .	-5.4660
Infrage would include St. Andreasberg , Braunlagen , Hoheiss and Sieber .	-5.3739
The information on the table should be supplemented via Internet .	-3.5152
Therefore , when choosing location a good mobile phone reception is important .	-3.9496
Freedom of barriers is also a criterion .	-1.2598
The starter trail was to be expanded to train later .	-5.1304
" The observer learnt a lot of valuable information about the physics of the individual stars " at the starring path .	-6.9459
They also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star would be more bright than another , even though it was much further removed .	-5.5303
Also , the star image is selected , and when he is best seen .	-6.3967
Since 2014 , the association has operated the highest observed star in North Germany in mountain towns St. Andreasberg .	-4.8552
According to the Federal National Park for Nature Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.8602

The units with the individual planet - including the degraded Pluto at the end of the day - are positioned accurately from one to two billion as a distance and scale .	-6.4257
The earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres , while the sun , which is exactly 75 meters away , is measuring 70 centimetres .	-5.3219
The entire distance of the planet 's trail is about four kilometres .	-2.7035
While light requires sun to Pluto about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to steal with Pluto .	-4.3578

I should like to dwell on lightweight .	-3.5804

That is what fans are asking for .	-1.4819
Let us give them that . '	-1.1520

Fortuna 's Hoffmann : ' Dreikette works better '	-4.3920
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes for the season against Braunschweig that the optimization of defense formation in eye points .	-3.9875
With the first season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result also , would not have been the two adversaries at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.0733
" These were two opponents too much , and we need to be even better in Aue , " says the defense player of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-4.6933
In the Arzgebirge it is planned to further optimize the three-range .	-4.3869
And a gate for free will no longer catch up with the forums .	-4.9459
" For the future , it will be that no one is aligning itself with Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-4.7084
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be more able to cope with the triangle than with the quadruple , even after experience in the preparation with the triangle .	-6.0505
" I still do not know how we will act in an eye " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing " because we have semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.3134
" It is prerequisite , but that we harmonise even better and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction . "	-5.1359
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-3.1219
" But whether you can speak of a malicious start after a draw doesn 't know .	-3.0057
The performance could be okay " , Hoffmann said .	-2.6863
" But if we were able to stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the poker , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal act . "	-6.8631
His trainer did not want to know that .	-2.1542
" I first judge the start of the season after six to eight days , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over an eye just because the game of things in Heidenheim had to be interrupted prematurely because of an unweather .	-5.3170
" Now they can begin the season quasi with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believed that players from Aue might be even more fresh , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an upgrading favorite in the bones .	-10.3117
" But they do not know as 100 % where they are now , " says the inner defender of Fortuna .	-3.5432
The guests from the Rhineland , as a light favourite on Sunday , go to the meeting at last ( almost ) ready stage of Aue .	-4.4749
" That we discard them simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is a nonsense , " says Funkel , whose record is very positive in defeating Aue from nine games .	-6.5595
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which must be beaten from the start , " says Fortuna 's chief coach .	-3.8463
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming . "	-2.7908
Funkel doesn 't want to experience its players on Sunday .	-3.5530
New results of the Swedish Asylum Assessment Tests	-4.1139
Recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of assessing their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.6292
The Swedish Federal Authority for Forensian Medicine ( Rättsmedicinalverket ) started carrying out the tests last year .	-8.6912
During the asylum procedure , they should make age estimates more precise , after the Swedish migration authority ( sales of migration ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under-aged .	-6.6458
To this day , migration sales have sent 6,880 cases at the latest , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31st , 2017 .	-4.8736
Eighty per cent ( 2002 ) was judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person " was possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.2787
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person ' possibly under 18 years of age ' .	-2.2138
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person 's age is called into question .	-2.5647
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results of recent months are permanent .	-2.8064
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are rather constant " , he said the magazine The Local .	-3.5720
The large proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that asylum seekers lied over their age .	-2.9528
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 42 cases ' suggesting that the examined person is 18 years or older ' .	-3.2180
When the Svenska Dagbladet newspaper examined the 581 published results , it found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-3.6200
The method of medical care assessment , where X-ray definitions are made by wisdom teeth and MRT pictures by knee detectors , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , was also .	-7.3212
One skeptic is the endocriologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether sooner or later they were usually through puberty .	-4.3257
" I had reason to think about this and I do not think that the way of measuring should be used .	-2.8643
To judge the age of biology in this way is very uncertain .	-2.8028
If we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-3.6777
Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is low . .	-7.8897
The biggest risk is that when the person is just under 18 , in this case it is roughly 10 % ' .	-4.2308

Prime Minister Weil wants Rapid New Election	-1.6898
CDU and FDP before the possible majority in Lower Saxony	-2.3610
In Lower Saxony , Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country day after the loss of the Red Green Government , but he does not want to resign .	-4.6576
Because on Friday the resolution of Parliament took place .	-5.4212
Prior to this , the surprising exit of a Green MEP from her country faction in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a serious crisis .	-4.8246
Five months before the official landing election date , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-time majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-8.5013
The Green MEP Elke Twestern so far set up its move with the non-nomination for 2018 in their constituency in Rotenburg ( Wü) .	-6.2040
" I see my political future in the CDU " , she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-1.5643
CDU Group leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend that his group accept them .	-6.0835
The CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Dutch Landtag , SPD and Green 68 seats .	-3.7387
So far , the ratio has been reversed .	-1.0043
The new Landtag is regularly elected on 14 January next year .	-2.9401
Thümler said that the Red Green Government must now decide whether it can continue to govern in this situation without a majority .	-3.9892
But Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of land should decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible .	-5.1703
The CDU Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday .	-2.1709
The country ’ s constitution also provides for the possibility that the Prime Minister will lose confidence and choose a successor .	-5.1695
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.0821
These possibilities need to be re-examined legally , " said Thümler .	-2.4021
'You will calmly discuss all issues when they are legally properly checked ' .	-4.0735
Thümler called Twest 's step " but a little curios " .	-3.1099
The politician himself stressed : ' I am not a traitor .	-2.1475
I feel very good ' .	-1.4036
She was a supporter of Schwarz-Green .	-4.0713
The Greens called on the absent Members to return their country 's mandate .	-3.5288
" We assume , of course , that they return their land day mandate , which they received through the green country list , with immediate effect , " the Chairman of the country , Meta Jansen-Kucz , and Stefan Körner .	-6.3512
The chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance Mr Piel said : ' We very much regret the decision of Elke Twestern ' .	-4.8165
You have made a conscious decision not to hold a debate in the group .	-3.0514
'Even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step ' .	-3.2559
Chancellor of the SPD , Martin Schulz , condemns the entry of the Dutch Greens , Elke Twestern , to the CDU , as betra.	-5.3708
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to voters , but also betrayal of Red Greens , " the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-3.4754
He backs Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to re-elect a country day .	-3.6459
The exit Twest costs the majority of the majority of Red Green in Lower Saxony .	-4.3514
The politician ' in her injured vanity and in her frustration put her personal interests before the good of the country ' , criticised the Secretary-General of the SPD , Hubertus Heil .	-5.8482
" It is scandalous that the CDU in Lower Saxony combines this dirty intrigue and tries to capitalize on it " .	-3.0595
In Lower Saxony ’ s CDU Group leader Björn Thümler is recommending to his MEPs that Elke Twestern should be included in the CDU .	-5.7522
The SPD Group leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , suggested that Twestern countries , with personal career remembrance , would distort the outcome of the 2013 rural election .	-6.7830
The CDU was then the strongest force before the SPD , but SPD and Greens had a tiny majority of one voice in the land .	-5.3324
Minister for Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous animals , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.5575
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8494
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.0093
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.7372
Agricultural Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with Editorial Network Germany ( RND ) .	-2.9746
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect against poisoned eggs ?	-1.6238
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamping .	-3.4294
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food Warnung.de , the Federal States provide the latest information on the Eier Charge concerned .	-5.5329
The affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.7501
Even if , according to everything we know at present , there is virtually no health risk .	-3.1516
Does Aldi now accept the best possible response - all the eggs out of the supply - because the central role of the Enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister ?	-4.8408
The food surveillance is the responsibility of the Federal States .	-3.0486
Nevertheless , my House has turned off immediately and has been well known for Germany 's sadness in close interaction with the authorities of countries .	-10.0412
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.6815
The trade , like the manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are viable and safe to in health . are not on the market .	-8.9252
If , in the case of eggs , the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded , these are not viable .	-4.9816
But uncontaminated eggs can be sold and eaten . .	-5.5644
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-2.3789
Are manufacturing companies and consumers on the same boat ?	-1.8654
Under current knowledge , production companies are not immediately guilty .	-4.0887
Instead , they must expect economic damage , owing to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-3.9991
As always , there are too few controllers in the worst case .	-2.9017
Is it only a matter of staff or of the final competence ?	-4.8284
It was the official checks that revealed the process .	-3.7819
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .	-2.6610
It is precisely for this reason that it is vital to clarify such events and to transfer them to the prosecutors in cases where crimes can be committed .	-5.9187
I have already made it several times that I expect the responsible authorities to provide a full explanation .	-4.0812
Is the regular alarm in food scandals really necessary ?	-2.0798
Consumers are entitled to only obtain safe and viable foods .	-3.2847
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food economy , consumers are quite rightly outraged .	-2.9954
The panelled means that manufacturers , traders and consumers have come into a situation which is absolutely not necessary .	-4.3477
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of Insecticide Fiproni in the attitude of life-producing animals is unacceptable and must be brought to an end without .	-5.2747
This needs to be worked hard on all levels in a coherent and manner .	-4.1655
I expect all the relevant authorities to clarify matters swiftly and in full .	-3.7513
How soccer financial rules affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-1.2909
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenses from European football clubs will not interrupt Neymar ’ s world-record transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-7.9544
Some of the consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-4.1689
Financial Fair Play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without great losses .	-4.1258
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy Brazil out of its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary of $ 10 million a year .	-2.7441
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.0586
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Neymar is signed and bringing him into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team through the energy-rich Katar family .	-5.8771
Companies may spend a lot of money on buying players , but must compete with legitimate sources of revenue that allow the Break Eve point in their football business .	-5.7032
FP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.2358
Former French players believed that associations that had borrowed huge debts in their quest for success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-4.7123
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitoring their losses .	-3.0023
The change meant that the business model , which Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club of potential and then invested heavily to improve team and build a global brand , should become a harder business .	-4.1658
Clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million during the current three-year FP relocation period that runs until 2018 .	-3.9562
And , though Platini fell into discord in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksandr Ceferin , continues to advocate a deterrent from excessive spending .	-5.2036
" Certainly , FFP is not dead and we are going to reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , with The Association Press last week .	-4.5829
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate , it may distribute the amount for reporting the duration of its contract .	-4.2970
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of payments can be exported to the tune of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years .	-4.2966
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , took the most severe sanctions .	-2.5678
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members would be limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-4.8630
UEFA is in search of clubs that could try to overwrite their financial supervision by ballooning their revenues from companies connected with the owners of a club .	-6.0553
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not make this a legitimate income .	-4.5099
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when the UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.9749
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments could come to Neymar on payments from the WM 2022 organizational committee in Qatar .	-3.5131
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have argued that Neymar ’ s World Cup ambassadors will become , and that such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could simply be found .	-4.4487
The sanctions against PSG to date mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observing any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-5.3966
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG about Neymar 's transfer , sagged on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-2.5865
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , because they were not entitled to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.2762
The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has earned a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-2.7431
The accounts for the last financial year are still to be published .	-2.1012
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising , and tricode sales .	-3.3532
The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.0939
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going and tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.6750
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of the La Lega , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to Qatars of ultimate ownership of PSG .	-4.5005
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares La Lega 's reservations against a state that finances a club .	-3.2178
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.7933
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-1.6296
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fairy , because it is possible to go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country . '	-4.8429
Swiss is in search of a new Schoggin supplier .	-8.8969
In recent years Chocolat Frey Bord-chocolate has produced for Swiss .	-3.8272
Southern cooperation is now coming to an end : the airline is retrieving the order .	-4.8929
Swiss-Spherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed , on request from the news agency sda , a corresponding report of the newspaper " North-West Switzerland " of Friday .	-5.3323
According to current planning , the Airline will enter into a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.6841
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control .	-2.2014
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.0258
Around 17 million small red-white packed shogging bags to 14 grams each year distribute the flight crew to the passenger .	-11.4357
The Swiss did not want to provide information about the costs .	-2.8808
Industrial insiders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with " north-west Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migras daughter earns an annual turnover of around one billion francs .	-5.2863
But the advertising effect is more important than ever : for a shogging manufacturer it is a prestigious order .	-4.5020
The Swiss does not want to betray the number of applicants with the new invitation to tender .	-4.5111
However , only Swiss producers come into question .	-3.0615
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey intends to try to revise the treaty beyond spring 2018 .	-3.9037
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.1901
Chocolate panels have been distributed on board of their flights since 2006 .	-3.5087
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Mikos daughter , Barry Callebaut had supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug .	-2.9945
Two and a half years ago , Swiss introduced the possibility of placing the logo with Chocolat Frey .	-3.2516
The airline works with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-1.5665
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are pampered with delicacies from the Confiserie Sprüngli , in the business class of naked passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey .	-5.4923
Swiss Schoggi from Chocolat Frey is also distributed on the short distance , both in business and in Economy Class .	-4.2739

Nostalgia goes to the niche " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-2.6938
This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980 ’ s , for the 90-year-old Grun-era ( when David Wain and Michael Showerold turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd for larger things .	-6.2659
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-3.0560
But , as a franchise , it feels that time is short .	-2.7177
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a spoken dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-2.7024
By asleep at the core of the game - middle-aged actors play horny children with adults - they nonetheless made it impossible to win the last part of the joke back .	-6.8545
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the guise graft principle , including a riff on the 90-year-old Stalker movies like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand that rocks the cradle " ) .	-6.4019
At one point , an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " stoke a character .	-3.8818
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.4996
The lively Coop ( Mr. Showerold ) , now Romanautor , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.2561
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-2.4257
And there is another crazy plot that is included in Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showage ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.8687
As always , excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.4627
It is particularly fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's sublip art of " singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old Knaacker .	-4.8557
It is the moments random madness that this franchise could stir like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twinty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the gangs how they will visit the film streams of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-6.0638
" Comrade Detective " in Amazon now recalls a different type of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The American " , the film " Atomic Blind " and even " GLOW " with its east-to-west Ring Symphony .	-5.0162
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director suggests to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the eighties with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth , atheism and the way of Marxism Lenininism .	-4.7959
The main roles - a hard swept Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also a producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levitt in English .	-4.3562
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.4196
But it is not much more than one idea .	-1.3039
There are some beautiful gigs about the sight ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans might be doing it with football ) .	-5.3324
And the list of famous spokesmen - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find the voice ' .	-2.9326
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - is involved - that it often plays as a single .	-3.9236
With six long episodes it is pulling , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-3.6701
Comrade Detective , which has been refined to a lesser length , could provide its agitpropsaire better , as Gregor and Iosef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who are devouring a bunch of Hamburger .	-7.3479
The message to the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a commodity .	-4.3462
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong : we do it even with our own recent history and with their own .	-4.2029
Battle against drug mafia in the country	-3.0327
The police have succeeded in fighting the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-2.3706
On Wednesday morning many objects were searched in the Black Forest Baar circle , in Rottwei , Constanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor 's Office announced on Friday .	-4.7814
Fifteen people between the age of 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants have already been issued against them .	-4.0765
In addition , the civil servants secured larger amounts of Marijuana and cocaine , guns and several hundreds of thousands of euros .	-4.5793
At the same time in Italy , two people were arrested .	-3.0826
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects of Italians .	-2.2491
The two will probably be shipped to Germany .	-2.8131
Italian and Bavarian intermediaries were involved in the action .	-3.8656
In total , over 300 police officers were in operation .	-3.8834
Mafia 's members are accused of organised drug crime , serious acts of violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-4.3498
Since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor 's Office has been investigating Constant against organised drug trafficking in Southern .	-7.4482
There was a constant exchange between the Prosecutors in Constanz and Palermo and the investigators of Kripo Rottwei had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-5.0680
Therefore , on Wednesday morning four officials from Palermo were also accompanied by the wholesale commitment .	-4.1335
In the case of the investigation , Italian nationals , in particular , were closely related to Italian mafia .	-5.8311

'Citizens ' data , which should not be appearing ' : According to a report , Germany 's Foreign Register has significant shortcomings .	-4.1245
This leads to partly serious defects in asylum procedures .	-1.6604
The Commissioner for Refugee Management of the Federal Government , Frank-Jürgen Werk , has , according to a media report , drawn attention to large gaps in the central register of foreigners .	-4.7966
Deficiencies in the data registered could lead to partially serious defects in asylum procedures and deportations , warning in an analysis of the ' Southern German Newspaper ' .	-5.2544
The register claims that ten million people are nationals of foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.7172
The data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.9842
Because the data had not been properly maintained , the quality of the data has not been good in parts .	-3.8197
In individual cases , data had been found in 1921 , " of people who have long since ceased to live , or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register " .	-4.9364
'Missible data inputs can slow returns considerably , ' says the report later on .	-5.3806
Moreover , the statistics on people who are tied to travel should cover EU citizens who would not have to leave .	-5.5783
However , such incorrect commitments led to ' a distorted debate on the handling of driving licences ' , which means that the analysis takes place .	-6.5962
Meanwhile , the German government appears to have begun to return refugee families to Italy with under 16 years of age .	-4.3799
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " New Osnabrer Zeitung " .	-3.1408
The paper therefore states that BAMF is again carrying out such procedures ' on families with children - with the exception of infants and infants - to Italy since 1 June 2017 " .	-5.9815
This has practically been impossible since the end of 2014 , according to the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.6964
Under the Dublin Convention , refugees from the EU state are the first to reach .	-4.1111

Italy has guaranteed the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.4370
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( EGMR ) believes that these commitments are sufficient .	-2.6337
Other EU countries would also be sending refugees back to Dublin under the Dublin Convention .	-4.0549
The Internal Left Speaker in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : " Families with children threaten human rights unlawful reception conditions and a threat to children ' due to the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system .	-5.9096

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.0207
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have stepped speculation about an increase .	-4.3441
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will be ' slow ' when it kept interest rates on family incomes in the middle of a growing pressure .	-4.6622
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) leaders agreed , at 6 to 2 , to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members this month striving to increase , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-5.4352
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % for 2017 and 1.6 % for 2018 , warning that the pressure on budget incomes would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just 3 % in the autumn .	-6.8948
But they signaled that , in the next few years , interest-rate hikes would be needed to curb the Brexit inflation , and they said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-5.0317
Members also agreed to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.1811
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financing for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more in the framework of this system - GBP 115 billion ( GBP ) sterling .	-6.3033
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the central prognosis of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption . '	-4.3049
In interest rates , it reiterated that " a certain tightening of monetary policy " would be necessary to cool inflation and a " slightly larger " scale than the markets expect .	-5.1810
Markets are currently predicting the first rise in next year ’ s third quarter and another in 2020 .	-2.2091
The Bank stressed , however , that increases would be ' gradual ' and ' limited ' .	-2.1427
The downward growth forecasts of the Bank for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-2.6364
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.0667
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after the news .	-1.9574
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , and it fell 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-5.3689
The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have damaged rising expectations for an increase in interest rates , and GDP has risen to 0.2 % in the second quarter , to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-4.8575
Growth in the third quarter is expected to be 0.3 % , although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year .	-2.9977
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low salaries , as the worsening will begin to get worse before it gets better .	-5.1342
It added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent income breakthrough ' in the next few years , but it added that wages will ' be considerably ' at the end of their three-year forecast .	-5.0201
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate some of the lower consumer spending .	-4.0588
The decision comes one year after the lowering of interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU vote , which caused the pound to fall .	-3.7817
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years before this will fully achieve prices and the economy .	-2.4489
Before the Bank ’ s final ruling on interest rates , the reputation was growing after an increase in interest rates , as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding a rise to 0.5 % in July .	-5.0630
Inflation fell from 2.9 % last month to 2.6 % in June , even though the Bank said that this was expected and that it would resume in the coming months .	-3.6673
The Bank said that exceeding the target of 2 % was ' completely ' attributable to the weak pound .	-4.0630
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Broker , said : " In view of the recent fall in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are looking for business loans loudly and want to end the year positively .	-6.2683
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals are phased out and the new mortgages are closing , and many with duty-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-5.3756
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is to proclaim controversial HIV drug of 10,000 people .	-2.5031
Patients will receive access to ' transformative ' HIV prevention treatment from the High Court in September .	-4.2349
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) that can reduce infectious risk of high-risk patients by about 86 % , is now delivered by health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-6.5718
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal last year confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-3.8122
The chess announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief of Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-4.4736
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .	-3.5655
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.2738
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transfer for infectious people .	-2.8706
Removing prEP from sexual intercourse means that just enough medicines are available in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-4.3193
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before sex traffic .	-3.2550
Those who are eligible for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.4788
In clinics , appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transgences and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.5615
People who live in England and are registered with a pet doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-4.8705
The programme is <unk> 10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week following an international competitive procurement .	-3.0719
The study is to evaluate the entire potential of PrEP by gathering clinical evidence , as designed , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-5.0294
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.5991
It is another milestone in the progress of over three decades in tackling one of the greatest health challenges in mankind . '	-4.5001
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.5489
PrEP , geared to needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-2.8227
From September to September , high-HIV people will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .	-4.7766
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.2807
Ian Green , CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country , and that nobody with a risk to HIV is left behind .	-4.7077
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been granted , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV people . '	-3.5062
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-2.7337
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our HIV prevention approach and can end the transfer of this life-changing infection .	-3.7163
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-1.6278
Now it is important that this study is carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help to ensure that we get a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-5.5238
Live great life : Meanwhile and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.2855
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , fell from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-2.4645
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold its bags .	-3.1267
" Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-1.8585
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-9.1619
I saw this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-1.5907
I fell in love with them and made an offer on that day ' .	-3.6805
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot of the apartment has been completely overtaken .	-2.2118
The staff was very friendly and helpful .	-4.5722
" I wanted high ceilings , large window , lots of light .	-1.6498
That was my requirement ' , she says .	-2.6971
To this end , she commissioned the Architecture and Design Studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Joanne ’ s life .	-8.0361
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .	-4.0338
First had to think creatively to solve the task .	-6.3264
" The steel work is quite complicated " , he explains .	-2.3012
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were fitted together without having to stand up .	-4.3616
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of laying the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-4.7745
This arrangement enabled first to place two spaces in full intervals - with much additional drama .	-3.7254
For the intermediate floor , a classic Retrouvius copper light window looks down over the glamorous living area .	-7.9312
Spired gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting put the style for the program .	-3.1840
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.8256
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-2.6201
The kitchen feels like a window in a different room .	-3.3867
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all Joanne 's best and glasses .	-2.4372
The perception of a more glamorous room allows the beauty of the living room to close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.5702
Small snacks are not new .	-4.3478
What is special about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.8101
" A bit of engineering went in there , " explains Erfan from the steel reinforced , furbished MDF door .	-5.1499
" It is opposite , so that if you push the door high , it is very easy to slide . "	-5.6370
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could gain additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-4.0568
" At the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is appreciated " , says Erfan .	-2.4941
" In a rudimentary form , real estate broker will enter and calculate based on ground size . "	-6.9575
Here they have managed to enlarge the floor area while using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-5.0005
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional link in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.7037
" You 're not going to fall into the electrical sockets in the walls .	-5.5384
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . "	-2.6438
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard into something amazing .	-4.4306
Indeed , as Joanne , you could decide not to leave .	-1.8140
Brothers struggle for a $ 500 million empire	-3.6507
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , engaged in a discussion of one of the largest property imperials , Victoria , worth more than $ 500 million .	-9.1112
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared .	-4.2668
Paul wanted to withdraw from family operations since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.9629
Together with their mother Anna , the brothers have accumulated 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a deal on Smith Street , Colling.	-3.4594
There the Westco family founded Jeans and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .	-5.0346
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.2791
This money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs .	-3.7615
After an agreement with her late father , Colin , described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family , has about two-thirds of the company 's wealth and Paul about one-third .	-4.7042
A court act says that it means that Colin ownership has $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.7792
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.6423
" The splits proposed by Colin left him with what I thought to be the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit .	-3.9185
Last Friday , after several failed conciliation , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.3543
The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - Colin , as Paul claims to have excluded it .	-4.0729
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of managing some ownership incompetently .	-3.2585
In an early affidavit filed by Colin , he says that he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-3.7826
" My Italian heritage claims that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.0643
The costs rise in the case of hundreds of affidavits , e-mails and business reports , including dots , pitcher partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and both sides .	-5.5071
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated milk bars and delicatessen from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-4.0782
They used the security to buy the Collingwood congregation , where Colin opened the first Jeansladen of the family .	-5.4666
Colin says that he started Westco there when he ' was the High School in my recent years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . '	-3.7826
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property kindly to their sons .	-2.4335
" Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brothers to come to court , " she wrote .	-2.6363
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin asserting that Mark was paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 .	-4.0591
Both Lukas and Mark said Paul had been " banned on the terms of their financial separation " .	-4.3888
Colin was very reticent , even though he was a former AFL board member and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television star .	-4.0905
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.6056
Only Colin responded via SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case was before the courts .	-3.1616
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and move our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.9002
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the Court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.9053
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current quarrel , " he said and added that " he still hopes for a solution " .	-3.0081
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-1.4926
" Our affair will be resolved by the courts in the near future " , Colin wrote .	-1.5326
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.1863
Others tried it and failed .	-0.9891
John F. Kelly may be able to do it .	-2.0453
If so , he will be the first .	-0.7424
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff intends to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including the news media reports , in the hope of keeping the chief at an even higher rate .	-4.5902
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-0.9129
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior staff in his first day of work , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that fell into the hands of the president .	-4.1307
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . '	-4.5442
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-2.2661
President Trump ’ s relationship with television dates back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.7947
" If Trump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts that were to be persuaded , " said former electoral adviser Sam Nunberg in February to Politico .	-5.5119
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keep Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise . '	-4.2219
Okay .	-0.3197
But the idea that Trump ’ s twitter habit was ever “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.8636
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others , that Trump ’ s tweets would have absorbed even more fertility without their interventions .	-5.5267
We will probably never hear about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.0938
If his staff managed to keep anger of him already some time , their efforts were well worthwhile .	-5.4788
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from provoking controversy .	-7.7842
Part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are always trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may help to promote their views from the world .	-5.4761
Politico , which has a great deal of history , reported in May on the advice of advisers to give the president doubtful information for strategic reasons .	-5.2184
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.6222
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano to a negative press committee , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he will find out where they come from .	-5.4951
That is exactly what happened at the end of February , when somebody suddenly accused the President of being a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief chef Katie Walsh to be the source behind a cluster of leaks " in the White House .	-9.3767
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or has not offered any concrete evidence , or has in the past given false accusations and revoked them .	-4.8960
Trump read the article and began to consult staff about Walsh . "	-2.4551
Goldmacher added that the former Chief of Staff , Reence Priebus , and White House Secretary-General , Rob Porter , were trying to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump receives .	-5.4835
How did this fold ?	-1.9689
Kelly attempted to do the same three months later .	-1.2811
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisors are still striving for influence .	-3.1565
These immovable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.6286

Travellers negotiate over a ditch and return to the ' Millionaire ' line . ' ' , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.9187
Some of the wealthiest residents of the West Midlands are again facing war with some determined travelers who negotiated a tomb of bordering the community to demand a field in front of their homes .	-6.9474
Travelers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull called the " Millionaires series " .	-4.1297
They brought horses , babies , and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May , without being discouraged by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their influences .	-6.0084
The tactful group found a gap in defense plants and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.4553
Involving residents have pressured the Council of Solihull , who said that ' it is useless to deal with the problem ' .	-5.5673
An anonymous resident said : " They were pulled on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones on the passengers .	-5.2584
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-7.7708
Travellers were there in May and are now back .	-2.6201
More arrived yesterday evening , probably more so today ' .	-2.7254
She added : ' The Council of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by giving long information to protect its parks .	-4.6470
I live on the Streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local destinations if the Council cannot even stop doing so . '	-3.3575
A resident who did not want to be called said : ' It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-4.1499
The figures rose this time and even saw a horse in the parking area ' .	-3.7305
One spokesman of the Solihull Council said : " We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetbrook Road and work with the Solihull police , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to get it moving as quickly as possible .	-6.7201
In order to support our Assembly of Evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 .	-4.3586
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court has to examine when we are presenting our case . '	-4.8544
From Birkenhof , Waldhotel Luise	-0.9109
The Waldhotel Luise is made from the former Birkenhof Hotel .	-3.4407
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and should be opened on 1 March next year .	-3.7852
These are good news for the city .	-1.6773
After all , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , around 30 000 nights were lost every year and also income from the Kurtax .	-5.3867
In autumn 2014 , in the face of dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming to the district , the hotel building was offered as a collection of accommodation to the country ’ s councils , causing controversial discussions .	-6.1888
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a construction plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-5.4552
At that time , the decision was not uncontroversial in the Council of Europe .	-3.1728
But , above all , Freudenstadt ’ s mayor , Julian Oswald , defended the hotel location and spoke to the House at the time by serious stakeholders .	-4.6939
He should be right to keep .	-1.2883
The former Hotel Birkenhof bought a voluntary auction in Berlin with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , and wants to return to a house of the Three-Star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-6.8174
The group has four houses with the Freudentown Object .	-2.3222
Two of them in Bad Bergzaver and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.6870
You are called Hotel Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-2.2823
The former Birkenhof Hotel has long been a building container before the entrance and if you enter the hotel , it is clear how extensive renovation works will be carried out .	-5.7901
The floors were left out , ceilings were partially dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-3.8103
The entire hotel is a single building site .	-1.6710
There is still a lot to do by March .	-4.0034
" It 's really a beautiful hotel " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.1223
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-1.9229
The rooms are furnished with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is transformed , new windows are installed .	-4.2215
Everything should become ' close to the people ' later , as Thomas Scherer says .	-3.2435
'We want to make a jewelry ' .	-2.6360
The facilities include a swimming pool , a wellness area and a meeting room .	-2.6952
The hotel was very clean and comfortable .	-5.8546
The Waldhotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to expand , explains Scherer .	-5.7420
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or businessmen should feel at home .	-4.5541
Talks with OB Julian Oswald and Tourist Director Michael Kraus have already conducted , Scherer .	-4.3951
The views of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .	-3.4107
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.0661
When it comes to investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to commit himself exactly .	-4.4221
Nearly one million euros , he counts .	-1.7590
The exterior installations are also put on the front and this is already clearly visible .	-5.2086
An indoor courtyard creates a large terrace that will be accessible from the restaurant , which is open .	-4.0867
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-2.0382
Russia affair : US Special Councils Set Grand Jury	-3.3322
In the Russian-affair for US President Donald Trump , special counsel Robert Mueller should have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-5.2093
The body has begun work in recent weeks , writing the Wall Street Journal on behalf of those familiar with the cause .	-4.8712
The newspaper took the step as a sign that Mueller extended and intensified his inquiries .	-3.1280
The CNN station reported that there are already initial submissions of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.3398
US secret services have long accused the Kremlin of intervening in the presidential election campaign in 2016 .	-2.9410
Mueller investigated whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.1020
Several men who acted in the Republican election campaign should focus on the investigation .	-4.7711
According to reports , Mueller has also watched more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.0356
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special counsel Trump personally put into the centre and investigated the allegation that the president might have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-4.9075
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine the evidence available in possible cases of crime and to decide whether or not to accuse it .	-5.4715
So the Grand Jurys are also called the acclaim .	-4.3580
They are mostly turned on when there are larger and controversial cases .	-3.1458
The process is always carried out behind closed doors .	-2.0076
The board can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to invite persons for perception under Eid .	-4.7430
According to the CNN station , allegations have already been issued that are about meeting Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.7365
Those who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement in the report .	-2.6739
They should also provide documents .	-1.0142
In addition to Trump Jr. Trump ’ s advisers and songwriter Jared Kushner and his then campaign leader Paul Manafort attended the conversation .	-5.1206
Legal experts said on Thursday night on US television that the appointment shows that Mueller is not intimidating in his work and that if necessary he wants to act quickly .	-5.1352
But it must not be inevitable that the Grand Jury will end up on making a decision on an indictment .	-5.9546
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern to President Trump .	-3.5894
In the middle of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to portray the Russians ' affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.5622
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.4645
The issue gives democrats a chance to ' feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.5406
His Special Consultant Ty Cobb stated in an opinion that he did not know about setting up a Grand Jury .	-4.3273
But they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-3.8721
The White House is in favour of any measures that speed up the work of the special counsel in a fair way .	-3.8361
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it would not be determined against the president .	-3.7485
There was no reason to believe that this was a change in the statement .	-4.2332
But Mueller was only used after Trump met Comey .	-3.3863
It was because of this draft noise that reproduced Trump that he wanted to impede justice .	-6.1579
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.2072
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.1966
After depicting US media , the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and its staff .	-4.2170
The triggered speculation about whether Trump wants to sack Mueller .	-2.8467
Mueller , unlike an independent special council of Congress , such as the Watergate affair around the later resigned President Richard Nixon , has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the head of the President .	-6.2315
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-1.9382
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that the special counsel could no longer be easily dismissed .	-4.3742
Antarctica : The Antarctic Eisberg	-2.9323
In the Western Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has solved from the Scheleis , almost seven times in Berlin .	-5.7433
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research participated on Wednesday .	-2.4533
The column of more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers is now running north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted .	-5.4786
With 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest ice-giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-4.5631
He does not run a threat to people .	-3.2687
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the breakdown of the iceberg is unclear after research indications .	-3.6227
However , for some 30 years , there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region , the US research centre for snow and ice ( NSIDC ) is writing in a factual background .	-5.4885
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-1.6958
The columns that have now been broken have been part of the Larsen-C Scheleis .	-5.0138
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.0375
It grows steadily into the sea and regularly breaks out .	-3.8658
The Larsen-C-Scheleis is located in the south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula .	-4.7349
To the north of this rocky celebration , balances of growth and disruption were disturbed a few years ago .	-5.6298
Daniela Jansen writes a complete celebration there , writing AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-5.2462
There is some evidence that the Larsen-C barrel is at risk , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-6.7771
Moreover , the ice plate is under tension and could fall apart if a key spot breaks a piece .	-6.4035
The melting of coat and iceberg does not increase the level of the sea , because it is flowing on the water and displacing as much water as it does after melting itself .	-6.8610
However , the loss of the feast leads to glaciers coming directly to the sea and leaving much faster than before .	-5.1231
This may increase the level of the sea , but only to a small extent , the British research project to observe the Antarctic ( Midas ) is .	-8.8272
According to AWI data , the Larsen-C barge is the fourth largest barge of the Antarctic , with nearly 50 000 square kilometers .	-5.5203
On the way from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-6.2802
There it breaks regularly .	-4.9617
" Although it is a natural occurrence and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of British Swansea University .	-4.3647
" This is the longest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.5934
According to scientists , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , " Our models say that it will be less stable . "	-4.3320
But that development will take decades .	-1.8516
Although these researchers do not attribute to climate change to the crash of this gigantic iceberg , many of the Antarctic peninsula 's iron shelves have fallen apart in recent decades .	-5.6694
This long Antarctica pot spreads toward South America .	-3.1060
According to data from the research programme British Antarctic Survey , the Antarctic Peninsula 's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.2637
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-2.5771
The Antarctic peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the last 50 years and counts to the areas where temperatures are most rapidly rising .	-4.3974
CDU wants Haus Tariff at Personal	-3.7892
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacancies , the CDU is calling for the employers ' association to be made more attractive .	-4.7014
Only shortly before the summer break , the Kristag 's 41 new posts went through the administration .	-4.8528
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-1.5727
Now 17 trainees have completed their first day of work .	-2.9088
It seems that the teachings at the circle are very enthusiastic .	-5.7899
Around 620 applications have been in place for the places to be found this year .	-2.9308
However , the circle still lacks staff to be able to cope with increased demands and tasks .	-3.8910
There are still 50 non-occupied places at the Mettmann circle .	-2.9486
Among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are sought .	-2.9460
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in Kristag and to oppose the shortage of expertise in the administration .	-5.7726
The administration is to ' develop a concept of personnel recovery and human development ' according to the wishes of the parties .	-5.1843
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals but to counter the lack of applicants in the future .	-4.1397
The overall concept should be internally and externally orientated , should show concrete measures for cross-beginners and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP , and UWG .	-6.0318
That sounds good .	-2.9249
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known earlier .	-4.6388
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-1.6422
We are talking about a genuine ' competition from public employers ' .	-2.5795
In addition , a large number of employees who exclude illnesses or agents from the service .	-4.5225
So the maximum time to act so that no more jobs are left unemployed .	-4.3767
But Klaus-Dieter peoples , the leader of the CDU Group , go beyond the joint motion with his party .	-4.2227
He recently caused a fierce surprise in the Kristag day when he publicly questioned the personnel costs coverage and stunned the other parties .	-6.8815
Citizens want to be reviewed all the possibilities allowing the exit from the municipal employer association .	-5.9867
" If we do not reach a satisfactory solution in the short term , the circle management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the district cities - should strive for a house tariff , " people .	-5.8581
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay better the employees and officials than the public service tariff actually .	-4.8622
Currently , salaries are prescribed accurately , increases or more money are only available if you switch to a higher level based on professional years .	-5.7970
But the work of the circle has grown more and more in recent years .	-2.9293
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Prostitute Protection Act .	-3.5887
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Thomas Hendele and Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-3.8349
Italy is Strengthening the tone of NGO Migration Boats	-2.5950
Italy warns NGOs that bailout boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they should not continue to do so unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-3.9283
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.1060
Minnitis warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rettet Agency because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.3104
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to give its opinion on extensive accusations by the Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.7025
" For us , the rescue of human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-8.0377
'We can only judge any accusations currently made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-4.2557
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the boat of ' Youth rescue ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.1112
It is suspected that its occupation is taking muchboat migrants on board , who are delivered directly to them by traffickers , and that the smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again .	-7.0100
At least such a meeting , it was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the Public Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.7256
The occupation is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian coastguard to oversee the humanitarian rescue operations in the zone and not for any other motive .	-4.3154
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must first and foremost have an Italian police officer who is monitoring their activities .	-3.7497
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep to the code : Save the Children , Malta MOAS and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.4521
On Thursday , the latter said that the new rules would be unnecessary but acceptable , because they would not entail ' major changes or disabilities ' of their bailouts .	-3.8827
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is doctors without frontiers ( MSF ) .	-2.8010
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has dropped sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast and to cooperate with the local mayors have borne fruit .	-5.2203
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the minister said .	-4.9919
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-3.5437
Increases and Trials	-1.3633
Nine Weiler bikers , the " Berliner External Posten " and two guests met in Wachenheim in the North Pfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-4.2911
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-2.1906
Accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley has proved to be a good starting point for all tours .	-7.0964
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.1058
At hot summer temperatures along the vineyards the first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim .	-4.0734
The viewpoints followed , partly on towers , which could be looked far above the fortress forest and the fore.	-6.6846
In between , there have been longer and longer increases in which long trials reward .	-3.6597
On the second day , after Bad Dürkheim , the saline and the folk sausage market went to Bad Dürk.	-4.2266
Again , the viewpoint was eye-catching , connected by " flowing " trials and moderate climbs .	-4.4257
On the last two days a lot of elevated meters had been said .	-6.8037
Caves , rock , towers , castles , ruins and shelter brought welcome breaks .	-3.3074
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers in the open-air hall breathe healing soles .	-4.6232
New Town has also been taxed .	-3.1120
After 173 kilometers and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pälzer Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural .	-8.8955
Konsole instead of Rasen - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport .	-3.7872
Are sports stars in the future in front of computer consoles instead of spreading through winds and weather over the stadium ?	-5.3042
Fact is : e-sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gangs included .	-4.2011
This was also recognized by the first Bundesliga people who are increasingly involved in this area .	-3.9831
VfL Wolfsburg began in 2015 , later the FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart , who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals under contract for computer games FIFA 17 .	-5.1665
" We hope to excite new young target groups for the VfB " , says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.6734
He is certain that there are still a number of clubs climbing up this train .	-5.4868
Next weekend , FIFA will be organizing the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in London , where players of different clubs compete .	-4.1510
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg have qualified for example Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven .	-2.7981
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.4348
The former trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen is now advising a virtual football player agency .	-2.3977
" Real football , especially with the 14 to 30 year-olds , has to address the fact that young people still go to stadium in the future " says the 52-year-old .	-6.0209
And : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-3.5805
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , online you could be present much more often on these markets than once a year to send the Federal Licence Assembly to Asia .	-5.4576
What exactly is at issue here ?	-1.3430
In e-sport , computer games like " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterrice " or the football simulation FIFA will be contest-level .	-4.8144
Long ago , as in normal sport , leagues established themselves in which professionals compete .	-4.7161
And during the 2022 Asian Games , e-Sport is already part of the official programme .	-5.5966
But is it really a kind of sport ? ?	-3.2740
For many , the idea is surely required .	-3.5050
Ingo Frobous , too , has long confronted the issue .	-4.1642
For the professor at the German sports college in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and has many biological and physical reactions that you can also find in classical sport - for example , increased cardiovascular frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.7809
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability .	-3.4581
Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their body and take care of their diets .	-6.9123
" The fit player is a good player . "	-1.8812
Frobous also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-3.8649
Controls are difficult to implement on online games , and classical sport structures were missing in the scene .	-4.5924
The scientists positively highlight the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-3.1066
Players are travelling internationally , like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.7279
A study of Deloitte Corporate Consulting and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) states that e-Sport is growing rapidly .	-5.7843
In 2016 , it had implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments .	-2.7320
Sales will be 130 million in three years .	-2.2691
That is little in the face of the EUR 2.4 billion of the football bond . , , , , . , , are , , and . , , , , , ,	-8.3468
The Deloitte consultants , however , would not be far away from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey .	-4.4217
Many countries have gone further internationally .	-4.6773
Major markets are Asia and the US , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-3.9375
Hollywood Schauspieler Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-betting provider Unikrn .	-3.1395
Europe is also doing something .	-2.3583
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a educational compartment , says Frobous .	-4.8130
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , football first-line clubs are now required to set up an e-sports department .	-3.0915
" Compared to Europe , Germany lags behind , " VfB Executive Board Röttgermann explains .	-4.6698
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia , and to clarify old times .	-4.9395
It is a question of preserving the tradition of the association , but also aligning the company to the modern market .	-6.5042
" We live in a digitalised world , " says also Dutt .	-2.4828
" It is impossible to stick to the fact that everything is as always in football as it was . "	-8.9826
Gift-egg eggs - The Ei alternatives for cooking and baking	-3.5805
The poisonous egg scandal now affects almost all states of the state .	-3.7375
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and took all the eggs out of the sale in Germany .	-3.1771
The shelves are only to be taken with eggs that have proved not to contain fipronil .	-5.9007
Michelle Carter condemns the texts pushing Conrad Roy into suicide .	-1.8980
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to commit suicide through texts and calls .	-3.1101
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years were exposed to nutrition .	-2.8813
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.4945
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is untrustworthy .	-2.0343
My son was my best friend . '	-1.1425
Carter was allowed to remain free until the appointment .	-2.9940
It had been confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but its legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered a mental disease .	-4.0095
Carter there was dressed in red trousers and a cream colored blouse with tears in the eyes , with faded hands and downward eyes when she was sentenced .	-6.8489
" Your actions have murdered Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.3455
" They ended their lives to make their own better .	-2.3145
She has taken no responsibility ' , she said .	-2.4060
" She has not shown any faithfulness " .	-2.6398
However , Carter 's lawyer said that it was a ' terrible situation that she entirely regretted ' .	-8.0910
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find out that her " age or maturity , or even her mental illness , have a significant impact on her actions " .	-4.4521
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , saying that there is ' no day in which I do not miss the loss of my loved son .	-3.9921
I want him to be proud of me and circumvented with everything , and I try to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain we will wear for eternity ' .	-6.0300
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said she would be " persecuted " that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a tant for his children .	-3.9356
" Not having this only person with whom I have been with every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.6017
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to call on another person to commit suicide .	-2.8160
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-2.5319
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s written announcements revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.9326
" If you go , jump from a building , make yourself , I don 't know there are many ways " , she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.4236
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " Everything you must do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-3.7548
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that it should benefit from the case by any press .	-2.9704
The case has divided the legal opinion .	-1.8636
Amanda Knox was one of the few who defended Carter , who was convicted of her British fellow resident in Italy in 2007 before she was released two years ago .	-3.9750
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published in the Los Angeles Times a comment : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-5.9620
Joshua Kiimmich ’ s New Mini Lahm of the FC Bavaria	-3.0165
That Joshua Kiimmich was born as a captain at Audi Cup is no coincidence .	-4.2305
The FC Bayern trains a big season to the Confed Cup winner - Extra-Motivation does not harm .	-4.6933
Something else was different in his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kiimmich immediately saw , even though the additional clothes was very very .	-5.7093
Of course , since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was seen , he kept the bid for him .	-6.4889
" The trainer hasn 't announced it , " the Confed Cup winner was told behind , after his first match as Bavaria captain .	-4.8611
Fine , the input could have been better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.8572
But the coach character could interpret Kimich as well .	-3.2645
It was not the eight years older Arturo Vidal who had been selected as the leader in the C-Elf made up of youth players , debutants , and especially from a holiday .	-8.8153
Sugarl is the best way to distribute sugar to those who want to keep in touch with whim .	-6.6528
So anyone who was born to enter the legacy of Lam can only use a small extra-motivation .	-5.2322
Kimminh confirmed : " That is what you want as a player to assume responsibility " .	-4.1310
On Wednesday the 22-year-old flied as a mini lame over the field .	-3.7734
To the right , this is his position , the white bite on the arm did its rest .	-3.5158
In the beginning , Kimlich acted like the one who can also take the rudder in his hand .	-7.7856
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unparalleled force .	-2.5990
He had a look for it all , while many others were occupied with himself .	-6.6006
Vidal had to overplay its lack of fitness ( hardly folded ) ; Renato Sanches began to link up the achievements of the Asian journey on devil ( suddenly ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle had not revealed negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian Trikot .	-7.8558
That , after all , was a good thing .	-2.5340
Along with Kiimmich , Rudy ran out of defense , both acting sovereign .	-4.9141

Businesses satisfied with the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economy praises Wissings Tempo .	-3.8229
It was often unusual , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Eveline Lemke ( Green ) , nor the Minister of Economic Affairs of the Rhineland-Palatinate .	-4.3202
This shows more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs , People Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-4.2950
Cammers and companies in the region are talking about T V-request about a change in economic policy - and at the same time they are blaming the old minister .	-7.0248
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Industries ( VTU ) , says , " Wissing picks up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.3995
Natus sees the largest U-turn in infrastructure policy : Kelberg and Adenau ’ s road road gaps are now high in the country ’ s priority list .	-5.8276
Even this year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , with the aim of establishing a building right by 2021 .	-4.9707
The country ’ s plans also play a role in the trier trier ’ s western circumvention , which is in the primary need of the German Traffic Road Plan .	-6.5009

Natus sees it as a way of supporting regional , but internationally competitive , companies .	-3.9519

Audi should change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are confronted with a backlash .	-2.9697
One day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.5274
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options as a driving constraint ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-4.9373
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedess vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.7541
None of the companies described the undertakings as a retrieval .	-4.4767
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-2.0758
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and may cause asthma .	-1.9682
The cost of car manufacturers to install installations for the neutralisation of exhaust gases issued by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep car prices competitive .	-4.5545
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of using powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-2.4368
Businesses are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called intermediate appliances that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but when normal driving conditions are .	-6.2517
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.4808
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.3754

Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the Audi authorities accused of having installed a system to circumvent the emission rules in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was extended .	-4.8354
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put Volkswagen under heavy strain : the luxury car manufacturer disproportionately contributes to Volkswagen ’ s profits .	-4.2302

Mordillos ’ s knock-on and laughing against .	-3.5879
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most frequently published cartoon drawers , the noses of his figures are his trademark .	-4.2895
Even with 85 , the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-3.0199
His message : laugh , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-2.0685
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.2726
In the first years as an artist , he proposed himself , among other things , as a drawing for congratulations - which frustrated him .	-4.6702
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when I lost my job , " he once said .	-1.8544
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , the breakthrough came at the end of the 1960s : with the publication of his Cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.5379
Mordillo even found many fans in China .	-1.5546
The artist of cities is continually inspiring .	-3.1065
Large murdillo-figures are lured in drawings with Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.6287
The early morning , according to his own specifications , he is still in the drawing table , works almost ten hours a day .	-5.0985
His drolly figures continue to spread throughout the world through calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , t-shirts , plush animals and watches .	-5.5231
He has also worked on a film of character and a TV series with his characters .	-4.6599
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos 's most popular animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as opponent .	-4.2224
His figures speak for the first time in the 3D film , which is supposed to have a cinema effect in 2019 .	-4.5481
" I don 't know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.1402
The script is not written by him .	-1.5558
This is why he focuses more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced worthlessly .	-4.8377
Lavendel of the Provence of Climate Change	-2.2036
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is at risk of climate change .	-2.2051
The lavender is diminishing because of the conditions of drought and because of diseases , causing major headaches to scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.0187
Eric Chaisse , expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : " The lavender in the Provence is in effect jeopardised because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn .	-5.8835
This affects the life of Lavendel .	-1.9212
There is also a small zicade , a microbacterium that handles dwarfs , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-4.1784
The stakes are high .	-1.8408
Lavendelöl not only attracts tourists , it is also very important for perfume and cosmetics .	-4.1231
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either failed or weakened .	-3.2610
So we have fewer parts with Etherean oil . '	-3.6638
The solutions being considered include improved water distribution and the deceleration of soil degradation , but also the confusion of plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-5.2440

The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-1.7497
The staff of the Wednesday newspaper Riodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and incomprehensible drug wars .	-5.1308
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .	-1.9778
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.7574
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer : to take their children into the office , which in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades , or to leave them at home .	-5.3706
Security experts wrote three words on a table at the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .	-2.9568
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and building feelings are enough .	-4.0311
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of standing on the government ’ s or cartels ’ salaries , a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-3.7292
There is no rest from violence , and while the corpses are looming throughout the country , there are more and more journalists in it : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 , after attacks and threats under federal protection , and so far , there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.7743
Among the latter is their editor and inspiration of Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.7669
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug violence .	-2.6458
His absence is deeply felt , even though his presence is there everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " , hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building . Two repin the 1930, Aaron Ibarra and Miriam Ramirez , carry T-shirts that show with glor typical .	-6.7306
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters are discussing their divided themes , the trauma , their alphabets , carelessness , Paranoia .	-4.1444
Although a special prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists .	-7.0792
As with most thousands of murders , each year with drug trafficking and organised crime , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.6347
At Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are untrustworthy , and even though the terrain is now more ridiculous .	-5.3156
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting on security has little use , says Ibarra .	-2.6944
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.4362
" As long as we do not know why , we all mistrust . "	-3.6416
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-3.1780
He was forced out of his car and 12 times he was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - translated by the " Twelfth River " .	-5.7141
The shooter went out in his car and damaged it close .	-5.0906
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.6483
He left a woman and two adult children .	-0.9617
Rumours tend to move freely to Culiacan .	-2.3876
But , on the issue of Valdez , there is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.2606
Since Guzman 's arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the bloodiest battlefields in the country , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-5.7213
There is no doubt that every day in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot in the streets or that the graveyard is full of decorated , double-handed footballs for drug royalists who are larger than many homes for the living .	-9.0118
Forget for one minute that there is a state of ' tranquility ' when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drugs trade routes to the United States .	-4.0512
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , has broken his blame for not protecting his friend .	-3.3947
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.1678
First , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez in February , a leader of a rival cartel faction in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.2148
This publication may have angry the sons , guessed gang members may buy each copy of the issue once it has been delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.3533
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper , which published the same story .	-3.5734
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.0085
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues thought he would always be there .	-2.3450
He worked as an expert reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , cooperating with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and selling US dollars .	-7.5645
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to practise journalism without encountering the problem of smoking , " said Bojorquez .	-2.7801
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place .	-3.2764
Reporters loved being able to publish hard-core research without fear of censorship , and the readers were fascinated by an publication , in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-4.2334
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot " award for her coverage in Latin America .	-6.0164
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever .	-3.0658
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-0.8736
" I want to live on " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.3506
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " said in an interview with Rompeviento TV last October .	-3.2109
" You have to take over the task that affects you as a journalist - either you play the dumb or you play the .	-5.0893
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.3812
The Riodoce team lacks Valdez , the vow of fun that could escape like a harbour worker , a friend who was generous with strokes and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-8.9313
They trust in their routine .	-2.2557
He would always bear his hat .	-1.8313
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , where he always sit on the same table .	-6.9499
Now they ask : Was his love of the routine his devil ?	-2.0106
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and stay alive .	-8.6203
" You don 't like to be concerned with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to get drugs .	-5.9109
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.4305
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-1.9795
Its own instincts trust .	-1.9538
If it is wrong , stop it .	-2.5869
The trouble is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that " smell of a sense that can be deceived ... and then things happened to Javier " .	-4.4598
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipos , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states , where there is a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials at home .	-4.8888
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.1561
In the area where Riodoce staff met for security training , mobile phones suddenly were not allowed , and days earlier it became known that Spyware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.8762
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.0454
They were commissioned by the government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a central quarter of Culiacan .	-3.8089
Half in joke , some of the reporters asked whether these officers were among the 50 % of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-3.8549
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountains , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-4.5068
For this week ’ s edition , Riodoce has listed three main stories .	-4.9860
There was the murder of the brother of former Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-1.9623
They also had an exposé on state spending , concentrated on the Governor 's home town .	-5.9052
And there was a group that was kidnapped in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the prosecutor .	-4.2938
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so caution was required when it became time to write what everyone in the city knows : the restaurant is a favourite place for drug dealers and authorities .	-4.4433
A reporter was recorded from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated all political levels almost the entire century .	-5.0635
Recently several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-calibre cases .	-2.4032
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military accident .	-4.0204
Only a few months before , the readers had seen the Valdez column as the most informed source of abduction .	-3.8087
" In the past we had already known what happened " , said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body status .	-4.2012
" All channels of communication are now broken with our sources " .	-2.0194
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.8610
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grasped a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-3.9670
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.7899
A burned body was discovered and civil servants say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.1868
Throughout the country , journalists have become more louder by writing in organised protests " SOS Press " on walks and buildings .	-3.6642
On that day , the director , Bojorquez , is away from Washington , trying to gain international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-3.5694
In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa , on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they said the truth .	-3.0950
Since then , she has been asking for her to be redistributed by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated its objectivity .	-4.5610
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-2.3222
In his last book " Narco Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also by commands of politicians and security forces , who have been under a cover with organised crime .	-6.7109
Last year , the media watchdog Articulo 19 assigned more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants .	-3.1598
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.7987
Obviously , the killings have a dissuasive effect .	-1.3900
No one forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern Tamaulipos border state six years ago .	-3.0713
Your body was found together with a note , which was allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel : " Here I am because of my reports . "	-6.5063
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head .	-1.8359
Some branches have chosen to close , such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua , following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-6.0270
Others , like El Manana of Nuevo Laredo , after the assassination of their director in 2004 .	-2.5419
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the Drug Cartels with a guide article on the cover page with the headline " What do you want from us ? "	-5.0751
Some journalists have fled from their home countries , or even from the country .	-1.7924
It is a painful decision .	-0.9028
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.3760
And sometimes they are hunted , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz .	-3.3439
It is a daily dance for those who are left behind and continue working with risky decisions .	-3.3077
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking is horrifying .	-2.7364
" Mexico goes to hell and that is why I was reporter , " he said .	-2.2221
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , Riodoce ’ s editors were sitting in front of the office and draking beer , when all their phones started to sleep .	-6.3617
A number of shields with rival and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dead .	-3.9803
The war escalated further , as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region .	-2.3821
From the Bordsteinkante they published the news on the Riodoce website .	-4.5147
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.3377
Sirenen heated near - another shooting in the area .	-3.6540
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were ready .	-3.0907
If they were afraid they did not .	-1.5642
Under the vast portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa , Riodoce staff followed his traces .	-5.1369
" As you can only remember to close this , " said Bojorquez , " when the same day that Javier was murdered , the internship mentor asked me to send her to the street to report " .	-6.2395
Dinosaurs used the Tarning to evade their enemies	-4.0585
At first glance , it looks like a statue , but a frightening one .	-2.2772
Now researchers found that the initial findings of the incredible nashirt of a Canadian miner were so well received that experts described it as the " Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurs " .	-4.8957
It was so well received that they even realized that his rugged skin was of reddish brun - and they said that it had something of a " calm past " .	-4.7435
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it the best preserved Dinosauer ever found and one of the best Dinosaur specimens in the world .	-4.6331
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurian living between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the circle .	-3.4677
His incredibly well preserved condition has amazed researchers who describe it as " really noteworthy " .	-3.9720
According to National Geographic reports , the panned plant fresser is the best preserved fossil of his kind .	-4.1886
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grew on 21 March 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.9197
He met something which seemed misplaced from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.4114
The Fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paläontology .	-2.2857
They spent the next six years detecting the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) severe earth clumps .	-3.9639
After all this hard work , the final result is ready to unveil .	-2.2185
" If you blink only a little with the eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientists at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to see .	-4.5603
" It will enter into the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of Dinosauria . "	-7.2387
Researchers found that this plant fresser , although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , was probably threatened by flesh eating dinosaurs .	-5.5914
The heavily divided dinosaur used a red and white warning to hide from predators , and used a demolition technique known as counter-complaint , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.9863
This would have allowed to mix better in its surroundings and escape enemies , say experts , indicating that major dinosaurs are threatened .	-5.0720
The 110 million year-old creature from the Nodosaurier family has made headlines in May and is now on display in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-6.5311
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours doing so thoroughly discovering it .	-4.7435
The astonishing preservation of the copy enabled Dr Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of shoots and armor over his body .	-4.4406
They discovered the shelter , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom . the creature were . were , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.6829
Although the shading of contrasts is customary , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta exceeds that of animals now living .	-6.2419
It indicates that the dinosaur has been driven by enough pressure from a meat eating dinosaur that evolution favored the disappearance of confrontation as a means of survival .	-5.7022
But most contemporary animals using the shelter - think of Rehe , Zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaurian was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-6.1640
" Starks predatory behavior on a massive , strong dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators have been to be creature time " , Brown said .	-5.4293
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.6839
Scientists continue to investigate the pet for indications of his life , including his conserved dance , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-4.7082
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was thrown into a river and carried out to the sea where he sank on the back to the sea .	-5.0314
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further than they are today .	-3.9489
" This nodosaurier is really remarkable , because it is fully covered with conserved shocked skin , but is also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-10.4388
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same as it did in the early rounds .	-3.1741
You don 't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it , but if you push a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . '	-5.5788
The roundabout time was a time when giant theropodes , carnivorous dinosaurs that stood on two legs , passed the earth .	-6.2927
Though the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the panned dinosaur was driven by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-4.2495
These include Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-3.1074
Scientists , whose latest findings appear in the curent biology journal , believe that Borealopelta was sunk and mummified after death in the sea .	-5.0396
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grew in Suncor Millenium Mine on 21 March 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.9344
According to the museum it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hip .	-3.2716
The creatures had an average of about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and played up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.2075
It contained two 20-inch long peaks that his shoulders touched .	-3.5486
The researchers believe that the panned plant fresser was swamped by the western Canada until a flooded river it flooded into the open sea .	-6.3000
But the underwater maintenance of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.9468
The glacier remains of this particular copy are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover holy pancreens along the dinosaur .	-8.7734
As Michael Greshako has written for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the Lotto .	-3.5873
The more I see it , the more confusing it will become .	-1.6242
Austered remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-4.3246
His right-hand front base is on his side , his five fingers are locked up .	-3.3427
I can count the shoots on his sole ' .	-2.8744
In the Better : Mass carom on A8 : Many Vauded	-5.2353
Heated accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Knap 30 vehicles are transported to a mass car.	-5.5052
There are numerous injured , kilometer-long traffic jams and gaps .	-3.3126
The A8 motorway Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) was injured for about 20 people in the late Thursday afternoon with a mammalian carom .	-6.5179
According to the police , at 5.00 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district Aichach-Friedberg ) during a weighter , almost 30 vehicles , including probably lorries , were intersected .	-5.9118
First of all , there was no information about the exact number of injured people .	-3.2590
It was easy to medium-size injuries , a police spokesperson said .	-3.6558
A large amount of rescue vehicles was at the point of the accident .	-4.1440
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .	-1.6984
In Munich , there was a about ten kilometres of restoration .	-5.9344
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive disabilities on the counter track - due to a large number of ga.	-5.0533
The fire fighter noted the indicators of the vehicle directors who are now facing sensitive penalties .	-6.6923
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.1496
A collision between a car carrier and a car .	-4.5197
A helicopter was on the way to the accident .	-1.6935
Deutsche Bahn : Konzern tests " Comfort Check-in "	-2.9439
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing is seated by the train and sleeping .	-3.9957
Or one is deeper in his work and has a real thoughts .	-3.2823
And then : pufff .	-1.5302
When the shaffer arrives , a passionate passenger will get out of the workflow .	-8.4922
Card control .	-1.3436
But the era of interruptions is soon over .	-3.5248
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the man-less ticket control .	-4.7377
It is easy to confirm by mobile that you take your seat and thereby evaluate the map .	-5.3765
A test operation is currently running on two tracks .	-1.7714
" If the offer is reached , we expand it .	-3.0592
It is expected to be available on many other long-haul routes in Germany early next year , " said a train slider .	-5.3906
" Comfort Check-in " the train calls the ticket rating without a sheeper .	-5.1486
In order to be able to use them , however , some conditions must be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.5818
And you have to book an online ticket - which is what most of the passengers already do . on !	-8.0155
It also needs to be bought via the App of the Railway which DB Navigator bought , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets anyway .	-5.4190
Finally , a seat reservation is needed .	-1.9936
For the " Comfort Check-in " works this way : you get up in the train , you call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-5.3872
In the case of the test customers a button for electronic recovery appears .	-4.3173
The train pets get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.5629
When the train attendant checks on tickets in Y he knows that there is a passenger with already appreciated online ticket .	-5.6600
So you can sleep further , continue working and keep quiet .	-3.5054
The " Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which in turn should be used by the passenger .	-5.0109
" Those who want to travel through our train personal without any ticket control simply check in at the DB Navigator .	-5.6094
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time by train , " says Michael Peterson , DB Fernando Marketing Board .	-4.1920
Second plus : " Our employees have more time than they are today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.6953
Anyone who is often travelling on railways knows that , in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest problems .	-6.5085
Because often you have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not have the documentation required to recover online tickets .	-6.3905
Either the credit card or staff card is missing or any other document you need to show .	-4.7459
The result is endless discussions between train attendees and passengers , which leads to poor mood in the section or large area and delays in the control of your own ticket and ultimately takes the time for the Schaffner to address other concerns .	-6.7260
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-1.8352
Also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections .	-2.5161
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet open .	-3.5373
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-2.3400
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was thrown to her core .	-3.2523
Only one day after arriving in New York City , St. Louis ’ s donors were on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on their phone .	-5.1703
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-2.3107
" The police killed a 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " said it .	-3.3626
Confusion because nobody else posted the information on their feed , it closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.3191
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly retained on her timeline .	-2.8743
The rapper from St. Louis was killed live to tweet the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old man who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-2.8441
He posted an image of Brown 's lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would remain four hours there .	-3.8047
" This is wild " , Ferrell thought in itself .	-3.4563
But death has been nothing new for them and their community .	-1.9523
She put her mobile phone to return to tweets later on the Canfield Drive .	-2.8801
There were photos of the police gang and people who took the steps , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who was a sign of the record : " Ferguson 's police killed my unarmed son ! "	-5.8434
She observed a live feed in which a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a lovely dog .	-3.7075
In another video , she said , another policeman safeguarded his gun and wrote : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-4.1751
" This is not common , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-3.0038
'This is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and which we can describe . '	-4.5059
In this moment I felt chill frost .	-3.2874
I was angry and white ' .	-1.5958
They booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-2.8697
After landing at 23 p.m. , she took her 6-year daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-3.6906
What happened over the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whase Streets ? " , in cinemas from 11 to 11 .	-7.0293
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the Community who have filled the streets to demand answers .	-3.7963
As Ferrell and her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a matching crown , went to Ferguson , the two discussed a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state « .	-9.8074
" Thou remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe in ? " She remembered what she said .	-3.6076
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a young boy of 18 and that was not right .	-3.3626
I could not take them along , " said Ferrell later .	-2.3332
" What happened today is a peak of what happened in the past .	-2.1821
They must know it and see it , and it must be raised in it .	-3.5189
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the different classes of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to be free to liberate ourselves .	-4.8381
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black women 's child .	-4.2601
I feel I would be doing her a bad service to keep her off . '	-3.7618
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was located on the South Florissant Road , a place facing the police authority , which became a campsite when the activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.1729
Ferrell and her daughter were connected with a local business owner who made lunch .	-3.2516
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.6002
Slowly , a new kind of activism started to appear for Ferrell Shape .	-3.9444
" My activism has changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St . Louis was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association , concentrating on Essen justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.7016
" I had no experience organizing it .	-1.6434
Everything has come . '	-1.4590
Weeks later , Ferrell met one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan .	-2.6683
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar wanted to " document " what happened .	-3.2509
One question came from Ferrell : " Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? " .	-8.8012
This skepticism was nurtured by countless cases of people , often of white - in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.4956
As Folayan said recently in an interview : ' We had heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not centralise their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.0879
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism rum for death tract inmates .	-3.5514
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals , following the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's passion .	-4.6663
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us , " said Davis .	-2.6602
" This was the main thing for me , as these people are being represented , because that is how I will be represented . "	-4.4694
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement is not a messiah leader but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film .	-4.9309
As a result , documents from " Whose Street ? " surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life , as she loses and marries her wife .	-4.0074
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.6759
" But I understand that there has to be a certain degree of vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-3.7736
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter movement .	-3.6991
Two of the three founders of the movement , following the killing of the Black Teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , identified the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media .	-4.0144
" Black , weak women in management positions have generally worn the movement , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-4.1178
Black , weak women have to bear the main burden of everything . '	-5.9997
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-3.0242
However , she insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-4.0945
" She was the person who raised this energy , " she said .	-2.5099
" It is no coincidence , even though it was on the front front front , because in a life on these crossings it is a black woman so much at stake .	-5.2669
You can feel their energy through the screen ' .	-1.7541
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but racial connections between the community and the police remain .	-2.4841
Ferrell is a demonstration for 2 <unk> years because of blocking a motorway .	-4.7501
She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : " A Chaos " .	-3.3129
However , she takes a song and feels committed to this memory since she was on the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-4.7170
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.8452
It is our duty to win .	-0.5750
We must love and support each other .	-1.5213
We have nothing to lose except our chains ' .	-1.0489
From " dream " to " Greenwahn " : TV readers discuss bit-gallery .	-3.2278
The bit gallery moves people even though it is not yet built .	-2.2870
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the people in advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-4.2834
Cold , the issue barely leaves one .	-3.2773
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volkswagen Bitburg " .	-2.5385
Whereas one says to the bit-gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " This would be real class " ( Nicole Show ) , comes from the other side : " Do no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Greenwahn ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-5.8356
While advocates build that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , including the rest of the business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be blown up .	-6.7571
In addition , the gallery is scheduled on the plot where the farmer market hall , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-5.3580
This will stop when building work starts .	-3.2623
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - for the Beda Square with the possibility of outside seats .	-5.2569
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying in the Farm Market for many years .	-4.6345
Our eggs , as well as the delicious cakes of the land freezes , are always very popular . , , , , , , , , , . , ,	-7.5303
We also discovered the metzgeria for us .	-2.6696
We would like to see this offer maintained , even during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-3.6808
Other cities also have that .	-2.2963
The small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-6.1218
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketer is located in a market hall in the gallery , the height of the rental goes .	-4.2943
This is probably not very low in the new project ' .	-3.6899
Eva Kilic : " Wo Shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-2.3064
Whether clothing , shoes , droughts or supermarkets , I find this superfluous .	-2.6282
We have enough of them in our city .	-2.7256
You can see how many shops are empty here - some have been months and years .	-2.7845
However , as there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall .	-4.3577
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , most of them offered directly by the producer and are inexpensive .	-4.6674
As you can see , shops in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies , because the rents are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-5.3199
Schade , specialist shops almost no longer exist , and what is left of them will probably disappear . '	-5.5792
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall doesn 't fit for me .	-2.1656
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.7642
Above all , where should the peasant market hall go in during the period of construction ?	-4.5335
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the bit gallery actually came into being .	-4.2810
Or is the Ghost Bit Gallery already in the past capable of selling all the shops from Bitburg ? "	-5.6472
George Marquet : " It simply will not work .	-1.3068
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.0623
In my view , it would have been better to promote a proper farming market rather than this gallery .	-2.9002
But for a peasant market hall , the madness of many building projects - I think - in Bitburg is no longer appropriate .	-6.2238
If the farm-market hall is broken , another culture will disappear . '	-3.9957
A fitting similarity : Artistic creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.8654
In the middle of Fridman Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost unnoticeable - hanging on cables .	-4.4015
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Hair cuts , who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.2156
Manning sent the committee from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst spent 35-year-old jail sentence after making secret diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website .	-5.7927
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Resemblance ( a fitting similarity ) .	-3.8187
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline incorporated its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a Transfrau , and groundbreaking dissident , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he only had three days in his office .	-5.8288
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithm analysis of DNA extracted from Manning and created from the 30 portraits , which might look like somebody with these genomic data , has a sharp , albeit a little intellectual comment not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways that can be interpreted and the inharsh determinism of these interpretations - but also created an identity .	-7.9470
Some who was born as Bradley Edward , but who has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty , was sentenced in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the Spionage Act , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.7687
Their image was suppressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photograph - a grain , black and white selfie , in which manning obviously keeps on a driver 's seat and a place-blind item - with which she was associated .	-8.1135
In 2015 Dewey Hagborg just came from the great success of its 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.7895
In it , the artists produced portraits of forensic artifacts such as cigarettes and chewing mines by extracting the DNA from waste to produce a picture of how these people could look like .	-6.1099
This was the time when she received an email from a magazine .	-2.3856
" You interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.4982
And she could not visit at this time and she could not be photographed , so make contact with Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.3135
The artist and her imprisoned muses became unequal letters that , over the course of two years , exchange several letters .	-3.7776
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanguno , which predicted a future in which President Chelsea ’ s judgment would convert and be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.4614
Indeed , that Obama would just a few days after the book was published , Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome way of happy meetings .	-4.3198
There is also a little low and stark now when the exhibition was opened , as Donald Trump is leading a war against informers from the government camp and against transgenger troops to find new , tweakable ways to flame the rigid divisions that he should actually resolve .	-8.2307
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about all these things after the strange timing , she said that " things happened for a particular reason " .	-3.5990
In an artistic statement written down on the wall of the gallery , Manning , with her overwhelming signature including ( the " i " in her family name is with a heart ) called for an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which was gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-5.6509
On the opposite wall , her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , is written in a pencil .	-4.0433
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all , by including the 200 ( ) ( or nuafter the of ! .	-6.1904
" What people hopefully will take with it is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also visible .	-4.3747
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . "	-2.1923
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own space , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above .	-3.9642
She shows how she appears in her hand with a freelance phone from the United States Disciplinary casers such as King Kong .	-5.3256
" When you make your speech compulsory , you won , " it is said .	-3.6863
" So never hold the mouth " .	-1.8883
" It came from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia .	-2.1704
" I still get goose when I talk about it . "	-2.7916
Some have not yet seen the exhibition personally - as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it were to do it , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , from their own genomic simulators , which are like Horden of Protestants .	-7.2809
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 " , Mannings Stature ) , in which their genetic hatred was written with a pencil .	-4.9468
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits .	-2.7255
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , as did the movement behind its liberation . "	-3.2635
Professor of the University of Northwest and a university employee , Oxford , sought killing .	-4.4701
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwest University and a student at the University of Oxford , who is looking for suspects after a man was born in a luxurious Chicago apartment with fatal injuries .	-5.9540
On Monday , Wyndham Latthem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murder for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranleau , as shown by the acts of the Cook County court .	-4.5751
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-1.9882
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.4679
Officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-3.1399
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of the event , and Detective investigate the stitch as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , said officials .	-4.8366
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwest University since 2007 .	-3.2364
Alan K. Cubbage , the Vice-President for University Relations , said in an e-mail declaration that Latthem has now been seized and excluded from the campus of Northwest University .	-5.7262
" This is now a criminal issue examined by the competent authorities , and Northwest University cooperates on this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.2754
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.4799
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an e-mail declaration that ' we are in contact with the UK police and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in any way possible ' .	-4.2067
The statement added that Warren 's colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .	-3.0245
Chief Communications Officers of the Chicago Police Agency , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urged suspects to face up to the authorities .	-3.5700
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them strengthen themselves " , said Guglielmi .	-3.4015
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-1.8967
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a wonderful tip that said something happened in housing 1008 .	-4.8092
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.1640
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.3623
It was confirmed by security cameras that lathem and warriors were in the building .	-2.5053
" We believe that professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-2.0530
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic event . "	-4.6745
" We will complete the WADA Road Plan in the near future " - Russian Vice Representative Mutko .	-6.3979
Russian Vice Representative Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) criteria for restoring the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.8173
" At a specific stage in meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in collaboration with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.5612
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.6487
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code which describes the criteria for re-establishing RUSADA and was recently published on the organisation 's website .	-4.2873
Mutko says that he has nothing to worry about Russia .	-2.5350
" All has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-1.7140
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.8005
However , one of the criteria listed in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA investigation by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.3418
On the matter , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake .	-3.2450
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.1043
But there were no public programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.0586
Mutkos agreed with the words of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission .	-3.2657
In conversation with the Russian RSport Office at the beginning of the day , Smirnov gave past problems in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations . . . the . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.5909
No one imagined to accept this report unconditionally , " Smirnov added .	-3.1856
RUSADA was ruled out in November 2015 in the wake of the Doping Scandal by WADA of carrying out doping controls in Russia .	-4.4754
It was , however , permitted to plan and coordinate tests under supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.2348
Following a visit to Moscow in July , WADA Director General Olivier Nigli stated that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to get back .	-4.0742
Aldi no longer sells eggs	-4.3895
This was shared by the business groups .	-2.3416
It is a purely prudential measure , and no health impairment could be ignored anymore , as the communication referred to .	-6.3227
Only Eier is now likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on antitrust products .	-6.4186
Aldi therefore want to make clarity and transparency among its customers .	-3.2316

Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your staff at your e-commerce start up , but the surveys did not work .	-3.1851
Answers were often vague , little helpful or , worse , fraudulent .	-2.0109
Even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.4371
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-3.1393
She has called people from outside for help .	-1.1590
A new breed of Human Resources Start-ups is watching to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.3534
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allows whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the Administrative Board .	-5.4844
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to pursue your health , but where is the fit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees engagement .	-4.6726
Save said they have a better understanding of what your employees think and feel up to Glint over the three years .	-5.7066
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance what units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can watch why .	-4.8763
Companies come to realise that , since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished , you will not be the next user who has been involved in scandals .	-5.6000
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.4779
The global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could hold more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the let 's Talk Payments financial website .	-3.6496
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in discredits .	-4.6545
Convercent has over 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.8911
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.6187
Like Glint , Convercent Corporations sends customized " puls " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time , and watch the heat maps of your problem areas .	-6.2052
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline which allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.4928
And when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.8030
" The court of public opinion captured regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and director of Convercent .	-6.0400
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or is unethical , Quinlan said that it can have costly consequences through consumer boycotts , workers ’ fluctuation and complaints .	-5.2910
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has been using Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their headquarters .	-4.9010
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company ’ s centre , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.3127
It was often intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way of monitoring the complaints of employees .	-3.2326
Now that the Convercent company is deploying , problems which were previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices - can be identified and addressed more quickly . are . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.8293
" I can get closer to this holistic 360 degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who led the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-4.0931
'We are protecting our shareholders against legal disputes ' .	-3.4186
Businesses started to take ethics , values , and employee engagement in 2002 more seriously after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical violations by the Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-4.4002
But it took for the " social media to come to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundering from going online .	-4.6727
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.1364
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-4.2191
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital Investors who supported both startups .	-2.7533
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-3.0594
Glitzerers secured $ 10 million in November by Bessener Venture Partners , bringing all of their financing to $ 60 million .	-3.8168
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-1.9617
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have hither.	-3.4129
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only insertions .	-2.7533
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and valued and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-6.1246
" When people are happy to be in a company that is listening to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company succeed , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-5.1428
Investors will reach returns when their portfolio companies run well , with companies working well and engaged .	-5.4169
If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and deployment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.7684
Data on employee engagement according to experts in job culture is important .	-3.5188
But the data is useless if a company 's administrators do not take measures .	-3.3389
Indeed , when a company asks for feedback , it can have a expectation that change is on the way .	-3.3229
And if change does not come fast enough , or at all , it can create disappointments and demotive employees .	-4.4724
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting , at Kotter International , the company that has seen too much data collection .	-4.8662
" Because if you will not follow staff ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-2.0543
Look at this ?	-2.2312
And whom do you not care , why should I ? '	-3.4169
Madison Reed , now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , so Errett .	-4.9543
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees , it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-9.1311
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is gaining new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-5.8808
" If you are not required to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.8513
" And if you lose people , you lose customers too .	-1.5892
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-1.4848
NCAA is doing away with the two-day practice and makes a long day for the Brussels .	-5.1953
It goes up to 23 o 'clock , when a lot of UCLA footballers entertain on a side of the new training fields of the team on the campus . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , . , , , , , , , , ,	-12.4176
Some have pulled out their tricoto parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-4.5387
For a good part of the team , these days are a lunch break .	-3.1998
Players who are engaged in the summer courses will return to their final exams after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6.30 p.m. . will . will .	-9.8508
" This is a real treasure mill for the boys the next three days , " Bruins trainer Jim Mora said , just before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.5522
NCAA eliminates two day exercises to ease the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.5919
This is why the first three training sessions of UCLA should start at 19 : 15 a.m. to meet the player 's timetables already completed .	-5.4778
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school for the first time during Mora 's six hours of play in Westwood .	-5.6289
They shall hold 18 exercises over August , 20 prior to the start of formal preparations for their preliminary action against Texas A & M in September .	-5.9367
Mora said he supported the NCAA rule change , even if they add another point to the widely employed routes of the player .	-4.7738
" We impose this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.3438
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to plain , they are great people .	-2.5741
I think that once we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.7832
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear sightseeing lines of its fields , with an adjacent parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center , a hotel of high class that has already been sounded with footballs which have given a protection net behind a staircase .	-8.9792
Bruin players are supposed to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there might be a problem if these rooms are free during the season .	-5.0112
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.9535
" This is a real problem , and it is not too far to think that people rent a room there and then stop there to record an exercise .	-5.5916
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good deal .	-3.3939
But we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.0447
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.3047
I am not particularly concerned about this .	-2.0798
We have a plan ' .	-0.7369
Facebook wants to intensify Tatsachen-Review in the fight against counterfeit news .	-3.7003
Facebook intends to send more potential articles with fake reports to third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world 's largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to fight so-called fake news .	-4.9334
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to detect possible false notifications and send them to factual auditors who will possibly show results from the original article .	-6.0254
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .	-3.3793
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hate-filled posts as before the September elections .	-5.2932
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate explanation in German that in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany a test of the new factual review will be launched .	-4.2199
" In addition to knowing which stories are contested by factual auditors of third parties , people want more context to make informed choices about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.6109
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to its news feed to reduce false news .	-3.3970
Creating a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-1.8849
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s .	-3.4636
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cozy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaari Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents .	-5.1705
" I find it so beautiful to see the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says flawy .	-8.0431
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand " .	-1.9156
This article is an outline and needs more content .	-3.7145
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional .	-2.6653
" I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-3.5753
" This is its thumb !	-3.3742
And letters always smoke for smoke , because at that time they sparked fire because of the light .	-4.7460
For anyone who lives later 300 years , the smell has an effect , as if it were himself .	-4.1740
Oh , I love Archive ! '	-1.1739
For someone who was so smitten with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest : I have overvalued my greeting a little " ) this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-5.6748
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the assembled hydrates on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the graves .	-5.2153
He walked through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscapes , gardens and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-4.4511
Then , at night he trank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-2.6154
Scotney 's intimate history is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last Erbin , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.6199
When Rhodes hit a decade later , employees began to attend the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the roof " .	-5.6932
Diaries , letters from the time of English Empires , maps representing who had what was : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-4.7220
Guys , let everything go wrong ! '	-3.7006
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man leaving the newly built castle to join the 1381 peasant rebellion .	-8.0838
" There is a record of a turmoil that was commissioned in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-4.4066
" The uprising started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good beginning .	-2.9854
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-1.9153
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - like ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuit patron , which the Darrell family hidden for seven years during English reform .	-3.9755
Or ' The Smuggler ' , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell of the 18th century was portrayed by his own burial , filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was digged ) .	-6.6253
The Darrells are Scotney ’ s Rhodes ' favorite family : " Men seemed to be good-fork , keep debt , and spend money on things they could not afford .	-6.1325
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marriing wealthy old women - I imagine them as a bunch of very eye-catching boys with a talent to get rid of . '	-4.7630
Following the end of his commitment in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.0016
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämmäki , the site of a Sanatorium from the early twentieth century , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-5.9083
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.1028
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-0.9454
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to finish with the damned life ' .	-6.5075
Campaign : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf covers .	-3.8179
On Friday , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for the launch of a new roof mark ( Thursday 's tour tour ) with the enchantment of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf . in .	-9.0160
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.6317
At the end of August there is to be a celebration on the island of Grafenthotel .	-4.0207
" Good for us .	-1.1659
Or ? " , ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters on the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-3.3180
" We don 't think this ( of course ! ) really " , write on their website that was opened yesterday .	-4.5682
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.3760
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems .	-2.0785
Basically , we firmly believe that , as a Bad Honnefer , we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.8859
The action is more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.8273
" An incomplete promise must be formulated , one that makes the city a distinctive mere feature " .	-8.6228
After all , it competes with other communities .	-1.4975
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a mid-fifth amount of its new roof mark and campaign .	-5.5016
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdo<unk>an 's Fear of the Army	-1.3450
Every year in early August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises about retirement and promotion in the officer corps .	-4.1721
That is also the case this week .	-1.8191
At first glance a normal process .	-1.6262
But nothing is routine with the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.8424
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff Building , as it did in the Prime Minister 's office .	-3.8021
The discussions under the head of the government now also took part in the five vice-prime ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .	-6.2297
This was the majority of the civilians in the YAS .	-2.9794
The government is pulling the reins in the military .	-2.0926
Whilst General Hulusi Akar remains in office , the commanders of army , air force , and marine were deported .	-5.1668
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of 326 generals and admirals .	-3.4343
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army 's ranks - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as a push landlord .	-6.3653
This week , Ankara has been negotiating against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-3.3983
Even the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the " gift of God " to overthrow Erdogan , because he gave him the opportunity to " completely clean the armed forces " .	-5.9102
But is Erdogan really under control of the army ?	-1.4037
At the end of February the newspaper " Hirriyeet " published an article entitled " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-4.3753
In the General Staff there were concerns about an increasing ' Islamisation ' of the army , which , among other things , manifested the lifting of the head ban on soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-5.2002
In any case , large-scale cleansing with the army and the security forces continues .	-3.5356
In mid-July , Erdogan caused another 7395 citizen fires by decree , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-4.7771
Erdogan seemed to tame the military .	-2.1383
The generals used to be the country ’ s masters .	-3.7334
They doomed to their role as guardian of the secular order three times .	-3.3621
After his 2002 election victory , Erdo<unk>an pushed back step by step the military ’ s power , not least in calling for the European Union ’ s reform guidelines .	-4.6711
Former officers say that Erdogan is targeting Islamization of the armed forces ahead .	-4.1455
In the Vocal Europe magazine , a notably unnamed officer who sought the coup for fear of prosecution abroad was warning that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time .	-5.3112
If that were true , it could not leave NATO cold .	-3.1676
In the alliance following the cleansing , there are doubts about the willingness of the Turkish army to intervene .	-6.2496
Leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened " , say Nato diplomats .	-2.1382
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules	-1.4948
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.6077
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , tighter rules on visa acquisition for temporary work permits and restrictions on family orientated visas .	-4.9949
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-2.5258
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-1.9148
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries spend green cards . "	-3.4017
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.3349
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.9219
Ministry wants to renovate the race towel route .	-4.1787
Over the past few months , there has been a dispute over the future of the racing hut - it is to be done very quickly .	-6.0330
Still before the end of the year it is planned to be built on the marvelous route that runs the tourist road .	-6.9390
In order to secure the future of the race towel in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , work is still to begin this year .	-4.6764
" With the decision to continue to order and renew the Ilmenau race , the country is acknowledging its commitment to this link , especially for tourism , " declared transport state secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-5.9101
The cost of repair of the track was approximately EUR 2.5 million .	-3.2082
Of that sum , the country perceives 75 % .	-2.5259
The treaty , on which the shuttle should be ordered by the country in future , is currently being voted definitively , declared sin .	-4.0251
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Railway operator have already agreed on the technical details .	-3.1302
" As a result , the roadmap , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Suhl .	-7.5743
The planned agreement between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of eleven years .	-2.6949
This is why the race shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-3.7698
The Rading-Shuttle is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Railway stations .	-5.0728
Over the last few months , a pilot operation has been tested whether enough people are used to order them back in the future .	-4.8602
The route is also heavily fluctuated in parts .	-2.7839
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned about it .	-1.8539
Just when you thought that 2017 cannot be even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the sex robots sector is coming . is .	-4.7773
Yes , in fact .	-1.5298
Sex robots are currently a big business .	-1.7424
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.0437
According to Noel Sharkey , emitter professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start to take their rise seriously .	-4.2574
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast and the type of fingernail .	-3.6795
" People are funny about them , but businesses are delivering a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-5.2959
Modern sex dolls have developed from their bootable partners with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.6583
The user can also " customize " his robot according to his convictions , selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the form of breast warnings to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.7245
But it will be even more disturbing , because many robots have the " personalities " that a star woman would move forward .	-4.8449
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.9024
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as sparkling .	-5.2137
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , which conveys the impression of bullying and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-4.7625
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is customized to your personality as well as possible , " the site of True Companion flashes .	-5.0351
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you do , etc .	-2.6908
She also has her mood during the day - just like real people !	-3.6330
It can be tired of being fixed for conversion or can be ' in mood ' !	-3.0398
There are many worrying aspects in this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relations - but the subdued female properties , the rape claims , if one takes a step towards Frigid ( in other words , resisting ) Farrah , worry one most .	-13.0971
On his website True Companion Roxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-8.1458
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxy ? " says it on the site .	-3.5535
However , these sex robots are not only one fetish or just keep another sex toy .	-2.8788
Their emergence and growing refinement point to some dark and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-4.6585
Most men , of course , will not keep sex robots , and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity , they remain provisionally on the verge of consumer culture .	-4.4186
But what is plunged from the peripheral zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live .	-3.8870
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market allows them to do so .	-2.4117
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has been boasting sexual attacks on women .	-5.5432
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Magd report ' ) are not the graphic images , the snowy body and the dashed eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.1583
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a big leap .	-2.6498
The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit pornostar proportions ) .	-4.2335
Her builders want to feel human , that they emulate the movement of a real body .	-7.1328
But , when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots are not real women .	-2.8162
You cannot separate yourself from your companion or simply walk away .	-4.2970
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that might disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-3.5815
In other words , they are fake slaves .	-2.0881

Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.1912
He makes Mitt Romney the invasion of common sense .	-3.4436
It has become a truism of the Trump era that the political divisions polarized by the US electorate have also split families in small format .	-4.6647
Around Christmas and Harvest Festival , there were newspapers in the US about how to deal with the relatives who voted for the horror of Trump .	-4.7861
We all supposedly strict ourselves to put our filter bubbles in place .	-4.2685
Trump ’ s power to bring families together has been less remarkable .	-1.8081
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been busy with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.2551
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-2.2979
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the Republican kingdom that fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and completely strange .	-4.0694
That is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that it brings with it considerable risks .	-4.3292
Trump has strengthened the left , but his presidency ’ s outgoing impact has the power to push us all right .	-4.8241
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we are referring to the cruel possibility that his girls will one day no longer be thrown out .	-5.1847
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” right-wing Republicans , which suddenly appear to be an intra-rationality relative to his standards .	-6.1448
Today , I find myself struck by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of the cradle - the dog on the AutoDach , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like ) - both of which are indeed a very mild offence compared to Trump .	-7.4954
If Trump goes , Republicans ’ next candidate must be mentally healthy only to qualify as an immense improvement .	-4.2429
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park , the largest of the Carousel of the New York parking department , and the best three dollars to be spent in the city if you do not need a coffee .	-5.6573
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crowded and the animals twist up to look full of fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and climbing music makes this strange .	-5.4249
So many clichés in a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream .	-3.7726
Fifty years later , and I am still not entirely beyond the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is , in fact , not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great circle in northern London .	-5.9671
The Central Park-Karussel , however , is still a strange magical experience , since there are two two-year-old , a 11-year-old and two women can go to it in the 40s and all have a great time .	-5.6467
If I could have assessed the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately nobody has asked for it .	-4.3915
On the other hand , this week in a department house , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could cross my credit card .	-3.9212
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option of balancing the assessment with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the ladder .	-9.9093
This not only results in a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the servers to bring personality into a situation where there is no need for it .	-4.9432
The poor woman in the department room was excessively grinding while I tired the experience of reaching her credit card with five stars .	-4.8521
Oscar Pistorius wields breast pain from prison into hospital .	-3.2439
For the second time , Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit .	-4.5508
Last year , he was put into hospital for the treatment of tailors at his hand , who , according to a case in his cell , suffered the prison authorities .	-6.0262
Pistorius was sentenced for murder to an appeal by prosecutors against a first coup .	-5.2560
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine 's day in 2013 by picking it up on them several times through a door of the toiletries booth in his Pretoria house .	-5.9196
Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin .	-4.8170
The prosecutors have announced their intention to use this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Apple , which they say is too lenient .	-5.1505
The National Prosecution Authority said that it would appeal to the South Africa Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.3015
Pistorius risks increasing its penalty to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .	-2.3957
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7106

Schululturer Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Civil House of Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday .	-5.0483
The 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Director Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the Hühnerhof , but is released into freedom .	-5.9273
The munter Shar introduced a musical entitled " The Adler in the Hühnerhof " .	-6.0379
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to break away from his chickens .	-3.7013
Instead of a chicken coat came out a small eagle .	-2.5029
But the hope of making a chicken from him fell apart , the eagle spawned his wings and determined on a high mountain .	-5.6851
After that , the classes showed a chicken dance in the classification of Yvonne Frank .	-2.6143
The Hens danced with the young gockles that wore the cylinders to bet .	-3.3306
The eagle stands for integration , said head of shoulder , Angelika Sitte .	-3.7292
The young person is different from the other animals , but one . is .	-5.7617
He will never be like a chicken .	-1.6903
His provision is to be free .	-1.3820

Thank you to colleagues , former head of school Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps to teaching passports and parents ' representatives .	-5.8339
Sophia Schumacher , the teacher of the classes , is now over .	-6.0447
After two years of teaching they dismissed very reluctantly , because it was a really great time .	-5.0009
Finally , they have been able to rely on the fourth-metre plaintiff .	-4.3591
All students had the chance to enjoy a song of summer time and holiday time .	-4.1425

Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-2.2257
Two Bulgaria were arrested for illegal campings in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-3.0226
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally camping people were arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgaria .	-4.8885
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is going on .	-3.0215
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that Bulgaria was released later .	-2.1357
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camps and impose significant fines on anyone who is found in a place which is not intended for that purpose .	-3.7829
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.2900
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .	-1.7761
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the people in question now need to know .	-2.7536
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.4981
Do Diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?	-2.2397
Overview of the most important questions and answers .	-1.7664
At the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.5413
They should improve the exhaust performance of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and , in part , Euro 6 .	-3.9461
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.6912
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :	-3.1736
Is the new action compulsory ?	-1.5051
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.1508
" The compulsory updates previously apply only to vehicles with rogue software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.7829
The KBA has arranged its retrofitting equipment .	-4.9798
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-1.4124
The manufacturers have announced swift implementation in the coming months , but have not yet given a precise date .	-3.6688
Daimler has announced that he will write each person concerned .	-4.0628
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-3.8242
How long will the overall circulation last ?	-2.5191
" Swift to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.4902
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-2.0099
" Because we have seen that freely car manufacturers do not act on the environment . "	-4.0914
How long will the update take ?	-1.0947
The rearmament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-1.9761
Time consumers can be given an appointment .	-2.7277
What are the drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.6489
The ACE counts for waiting .	-1.6054
Probably , foreign manufacturers would follow , so Smmetanin .	-4.2530
Now is there a massive price drop in Euro-4 cars ?	-3.0651
ACE fears this .	-1.0959
But it is precisely in the regions where there are risks of bans on journeys .	-4.2262
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-2.2642
The ACE counts to wait with a sale yet .	-2.2268

As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and Norman Lear ( 95 ) TV producer ( 86 ) are among the guys .	-5.4842
The awards will be handed over in early December .	-1.5569
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will be hosting a reception and taking part in the ceremony together with his wife Melania .	-3.4746
The award winner Lear , who was acclaimed with progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-5.7082
The ' New York Times ' said : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to deprive them of the means - and this affects me ' .	-4.7061
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use talks with Trump to clarify his view .	-3.6309

We Make the City Life	-3.9200
Roland Wacker , Hasch-Stadtbauder , will retire next year .	-5.5411
The location is already stated - suitable applicants are rare .	-4.1791
Wacker is a city mayor for 31 years .	-3.1789
He still has a great deal of fun in the press talks .	-7.5680
He reports of varied , but also demanding , tasks waiting for his successor .	-4.2656
At the same time , he wonders that so far no application has been completed .	-3.4601
The city is looking for an architect or a construction engineer in the near future .	-3.7899
In this way , given the regular cancellation deadlines , there will still be enough time for the preparation .	-6.0324
Since Hasach is a sub-construction authority for the administrative community , the applicant must make the relevant agreements .	-6.4674
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city .	-2.6587
If they could no longer fill them , they would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-3.7605
But proximity to the city and to the city itself is important , says Wacker , who reports about a good working climate and good mood between the public and the authority .	-5.8961
In more than 30 years in office , some major projects have accumulated on which the wacker looks proud .	-4.8964
" We make the city life value " , he is secure by the Bauamt and his staff .	-4.3203
In future , however , diverse projects will be on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen Park area , for example , has begun .	-5.4123
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , even the stadium construction is still topic .	-4.2830
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million if we do it right , " Wacker estimates .	-3.0601
" All in all , great tasks are waiting for my successor .	-2.3816
The work here is fun ' .	-1.0088
There is a large room for 2 people .	-4.2120
Hazakh ’ s own building yard and gardens can be responded on many rather flexible ones .	-6.6455
" You can move a lot , " says Wacker , and the design of green plants is often commendable by citizens and visitors .	-4.2062
Because the old town as an ensemble is under protection of monuments , it is important to have " an eye for what fits perfectly " if new buildings are approved , the outgoing townbuilding master emphasizes .	-7.2506
The master of the town itself bears a great responsibility in this respect .	-5.1684
He is a owner , " at the end everything is over my table " .	-3.4087
When working with care and coordination he can count on long-term employees : Markus Neumaier ( construction ) has been in operation for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( underbuilding ) has been in operation for 15 years .	-5.4252
Wacker also hopes that his successor will remain long , " We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the place " .	-4.8695
Because continuity is important not only for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .	-3.1367
Anyone who wants to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to carry out a study of Roland Wacker as a diploma engineer or bachelor with a special direction of architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and .	-8.4059
The Municipal Office has a high and low building , construction guidance , basic employment matters , administration of urban properties , municipal farm with a courtyard and town garden , as well as a construction law authority including monument protection .	-9.6978
Bicycle on guided tracks : Southern railway block closed	-8.9231
According to the police , the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail service in the area of Leoben Street ( B116 ) .	-5.3763
They were damaged so much that the approaching freight train had to be stopped .	-8.0526
The investigators leave two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-3.4819
Next to the scene a rose-like roller and bicycle driver had been observed by witnesses .	-4.4371
" This goes well beyond a lumber strip " , said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA .	-4.4027
The perpetrator would have put himself at great risk and also jeopardised transport .	-3.1620
In addition to the damage to the loc and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and costs for rail replacement , couples of the rail customers could also come to the perpetrators .	-7.5389
Overall , the speaker said it was a ' substantial ' sum .	-4.5731
The damage was repaired on Friday afternoon , and rail transport on the South Railway could be done without disability .	-6.1278
Nearly ten passenger trains were issued Friday morning , two of them related to long-distance transport .	-4.3834
Goods were not included , but they were late .	-3.2429
According to ÖB-Speaker Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of upper lines had to be replaced .	-6.6242
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-2.1897
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory note )	-2.2966
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.8000
But a new study claims the opposite : a diet rich of meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory remarks .	-3.1521
The incurable state of about 1.3 million in the United States and 300,000 in the United Kingdom causes stomach and blurring , recurrent or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-5.7944
While the people concerned are usually told to avoid meat and dairy products in order to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of protein contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant darme .	-5.3495
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the darm to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not enter the body .	-4.2326
Cells capable of triggering inflammatory are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-3.4547
If the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation , it may result in an inflammatory note .	-9.3891
Experiments found that a kind of tolerance of immune cells occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their invigorations .	-5.0489
And the bacterium needs Tryptopan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-2.9348
Professor Colonna said : " We have created a link between a bacteria species - Lactobacillus repeteri - which is a normal part of the darm-microbiome , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-4.9678
The more Tryptopan had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells " .	-2.9978
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich Tryptopian diet promote more tolerant , less inflammatory Darmmilius , if the same system also works for humans .	-5.5348
The post-doctorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promoted tolerance when it found that a group of study monuments had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was kept separate , this had not .	-5.8581
She suspected that the difference was to do with the Darmmikrobiomes of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms , usually living in the gastrointestinal tract .	-5.9151
The nozzles of the mice were DNA sequencing and six bacteria were found , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them at the mice .	-4.9179
Mäse was raised in a sterile environment , so that they had no Darmmikrobiom and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. repeteri and the immune cells .	-10.0472
To understand how bacteria impact on the immune system , researchers L. repeteri grew in a fluid , then transferring small volumes of fluid - without the bacteria - to unmature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-5.1347
Immuncells became tolerant cells .	-2.4660
When the active component was purified from liquid , it turned out to be a by-product of Tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid .	-4.1958
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophon in the M feed , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but if the Tryptoph values were halved , the number of cells dropped by half .	-4.7095
Dr Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-3.3796
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. repeteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory note .	-5.7814
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something that we would like to promote , as these cells drive inflammation on the internal surface of the darm .	-4.9320
Potential can lead to an expansion of this population in the presence of L. reuteri . '	-4.4949
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United committed a " genie " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.5220
At Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes that after the midfielder had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.8931
The $ 40 million signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the halter role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pushed forward to their loved ones .	-6.3796
Matic , however , was excluded from the Blues ’ preparatory Asia Tour , creating only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-4.4167
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.7997
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.2666
As well as Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku began in the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formalized his Start-XI for the beginning of the season .	-4.9272
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted another three more commitments , but he insisted that the club had already " fantastic work " to fulfil three of its four major new commitments .	-4.3549
" Three of four , for which I thank the association " , he added .	-2.2217
" I will be happy if they get four of them for me , but they have made a great effort . "	-4.0816

New Deep Baths for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem .	-2.8300
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was the leader of the Social Democratic Party , he always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-5.5356
It was not a party ’ s fault , just a headwind from the covenant – that was the main desire of the electoral fighters .	-7.9603
Since Mr Schulz led the party , that has fundamentally changed .	-2.4915
Since then , the employees of the Willy Brandt-Haus have been watching with growing horror the events in the FPD government .	-6.4769
What schooling from there since the beginning of the year would not be even described in the approach .	-4.8309
It was a low bubble .	-4.1802

Following the surprising end of the red green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-4.2598
" Once again , Rot-Green can simply not govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.6181
The surprising exit of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-2.7929
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition lost its one-time majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.6154
The Green chief executive Michael Kelllner has called on Elke Twestern to return their mandate to the pro-Dutch Green MEP .	-6.6714
The transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate .	-3.7648
Elke Twestern must immediately return its mandate , " said the German Federal Manager and the Green campaign leader , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-6.2345
" After all this must not be true " , a SPD campaign seeks to reach the party centre on Friday morning .	-5.1565
Stephan Weil , the Prime Minister of the Social Democratic Republic of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without a majority of its own government after the arrival of the Green Members .	-6.3837
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations .	-3.8028
And no one knows what is coming next .	-1.4865
The misery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-1.7044
A blue eye , no longer , the comrades calmed at the time .	-3.4242
After the local elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.7903
That became even worse , and it was far worse .	-4.5293
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the diamond , the Düsseldorf default haute the party smooth .	-4.1419
During the weeks afterwards , comrades refreshed .	-4.4837
Then , when they had just made new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg took place .	-3.2819
And with him came the next deep thread .	-2.4560
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong chief of the SPD , lost his nimbus on that weekend because he was in Elbphilharmony while his city burned .	-4.5253
And because , in crisis communication , he made almost all the wrong things .	-5.0991
Since then , cholesterol has been fighting for its political survival .	-3.0852
So now , Stephan Weil .	-2.9954
For a long time now , the VW Abgasaffary and its role in the Supervisory Board has been criticized by the Dutch Prime Minister .	-5.3527
Rent survey prizes have been added .	-3.2642
Nonetheless , or maybe precisely why , Weil has always tried to focus more and more on the bond in recent weeks .	-6.7062
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to develop his power in Berlin did not hide comrades around Martin Schulz .	-3.7451
They grant him because they promised Weil to stabilize the party .	-3.3439
That could be the exact opposite .	-2.7611
But Weil is not guilty of the partisan twist of the Dutch Greens .	-4.2115
Not at all at all .	-4.9256
For the time being , comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.6051
Her anger is directed towards the Greens , and especially on the breakaway parliamentarian , Twest .	-5.0765
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs TWesten puts her own career interests above the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left-wing in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.7366
Mrs TWesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as Director Candidate , but also on the list of Greens from the Netherlands , the Dutch Member goes on .	-9.3561
The logical consequence is that it returns its mandate .	-1.9047
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestag , laments an " undemocratic maneuver " .	-3.7891
" The will of the electorate four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who led the Dutch SPD as the leading candidate in the federal elections , the RND .	-4.3946
" Now a future CDU member 's personal career breaks the result of the vote , " Oppermann said .	-8.1128
He called for the background to be clarified .	-1.8403

The mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG city development received on Wednesday .	-3.3956
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a glimpse of what has happened .	-4.6552
The recreation areas have been recovered since 1991 .	-3.2990
Baden-Württemberg land still owns two-thirds of the support sum in the Sander Area I from 1991 to 2004 .	-5.6836
After all , the grant was still 60 % in the recovery area from 2005 to 2016 .	-4.1719
For shipowners , the existing refunds are a " successful project " - it is important to promote internal development , not only to open new buildings .	-9.6527
On 4 April , the Governing Bureau of Karlsruhe received information that there will be a reorganization area III .	-4.6948
The support sum amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country who receive the rest of the community .	-5.2648
How does a recovery area arise ?	-3.3944
We will continue to investigate , as we have heard , where the " really old " houses are .	-5.9234
There is also a role , however , whether there is any interest in the planned area to refuse .	-4.5785
If necessary , the territorial borders could then shift again .	-3.5985
STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gottzel on Wednesday evening .	-2.1258
Keller presented the contents of the Bund Land program " Social City " , where the refunds would be carried out .	-4.4806
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.2798
These measures would be implemented objectively , i.e. per plot .	-3.0398
The rehabilitation area would eventually be set as a statute .	-3.8455
The allocation period for aid has been in operation since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-2.3714
However , until September this year , the inventory would first be carried out in order to complete the questionnaire .	-6.4880
In November or December , the Statute is to be adopted as soon as possible , so that the refunds can begin next year .	-5.5499
Pietzschmann then declared that each local must carry out the said prior investigation .	-3.8830
It is a matter of evaluating urban abuses and deciding when will be refurbished and to what extent .	-6.7376
A refund entry will then be entered in the plot .	-4.8292
Pietzschmann will come back again after receiving and make an image of the situation , promised her .	-4.3095
Gottzel stressed that a major success factor for the project was the participation of the parties .	-3.5225
That is why there will be questionnaires which can be sent to the public in the coming weeks by post and completed by the end of summer holidays .	-4.4612
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and plot " that deals , among other things , with the construction state and the refurbishment intentions .	-7.5605
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing " , information on the size , division and residents of a living room can be made .	-3.6612
The blue " Operating Bow " can only be completed if the premises are located .	-7.4625
It should be noted , however , that Gottzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for conveyors .	-4.8379
In addition , new construction measures are not eligible .	-2.0647
Shindlers still stressed that the distribution of funding works according to the " Windhund principle " - who comes first , is mailed first .	-6.5278
You cannot reserve funds for later .	-3.8256
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were shown to make the attendants " tasteful " .	-6.6228
British inventors set themselves a microchip to get home and car with a hand-shaped movement .	-4.6734
A British inventor is the first in the country to use a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start a hand-shaped car .	-4.4265
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-4.2954
He has merged with Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultant anaestheist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is implemented according to medical standards .	-4.5845
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts for only 30 seconds .	-5.3030
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the castles to houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per chateau .	-4.0890
The married father of one has now builded at home as well as at his BMW Z4 technology , which starts when his hand is in control .	-4.1598
The White House 's promotional costs cost the taxpayers thousands	-3.3827
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American production last month will cost taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s data left to the TIME magazine .	-4.6245
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction .	-3.0158
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and White House officials rounded off products from all 50 countries .	-2.8959
The helicopter , built in Connecticut , has been exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin fire truck and a Mississippi forklift .	-5.0678
The White House ’ s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.3363
" I just wanted you to be aware of this , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " the commander of HMX-1 wrote his supervisor , the Deputy Marine Commander for Aviation on the eve of the event .	-4.6123
The news showed that the helicopter met at 15 a.m. on July 17 , at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn , and so long before the race was cleared from 18 : 00 to 21 : 00 .	-5.4033
The note adds that if the departure from the White House was delayed , a second team would be needed for the return flight due to the restriction of the hours of service .	-5.3245
The original crew was in operation with the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained in the aircraft during the time .	-8.8248
The records provided by TIME were not clear as to whether a second flight was ultimately required .	-3.7938
Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-3.1475
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-2.3461
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case " , the commander wrote .	-2.6368
" Klicking as if you are locked , " the Deputy Commander replied .	-3.6944
The event " Made in America " was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by Hatch Act .	-2.2226
But official events also have political upper tones .	-1.7464
At the event , the President initiated the reform of health reform underway in the Senate , and he advocated efforts to curb government rules .	-5.4933
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .	-3.0523
Presidents are obliged to use them for their journey .	-1.6463
But asking for their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-3.1629
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft performed taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-4.0719
" The White House is inspired by the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials " , said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.9950
HMX 1 occupations often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to replace US President of the White House with precise centimeters .	-3.8566
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , HMX-1 in the White House carried out 58 trap scenes .	-3.7818
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted on training needs for the flight crew for the month , said a officer .	-3.6667
Helicopter units also fled 11 hours on that day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-3.4710
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden on none of the other requirements presented at the event .	-3.4668
A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-6.4071
HMX-1 has no budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.5669
However , according to hourly tariffs of the US Department of Defense for the 2017 financial year , the DoD reimbursement for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per hour of .	-4.7878
Records of the unit will see the flight time of the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.6506
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .	-2.0622
" Setting the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for reimbursement is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.2284
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual appropriations ' .	-4.1023
According to a RAND study in 2015 , the refunds for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .	-4.2318
At this time , the former White House Press Speaker , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-5.2858
" The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , " said Spicer .	-1.7438
" And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , are dependent on it .	-3.0616
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-5.4672
It is , of course , appropriate to stress this ' .	-2.4131
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he took part in a fire vehicle ’ s seat .	-4.9067
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and interviewed the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-2.8927
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them . '	-2.5300

Despite the fact that five parties still have a brilliant balance , the top runner of the Second Tennis-Budget League has received sense of reality .	-7.4474
In any case , Teamchef Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-2.2250
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar format .	-2.6198
Especially on the rear positions I find the team very good ' .	-3.0712
The imports from the High North are particularly important for class and stability in the search village SV .	-5.1323
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to operations in the Davis Cup .	-2.9659
And they are also strong in double " , says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Oread , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.8386
" This , as always , becomes difficult for us .	-2.9917
You also need good luck ' .	-3.0888
The new team for the trip to the north is practical .	-3.6036
His debut for Blue White might give Maxime Janfour .	-2.6538

The previously unbeatable Chile Hans Podlipnik Castillo was yesterday with the White Russians Andrea Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball .	-4.8565
But he should be in Kiel , like Botic Van de Zandschulp , Niels Lootsma ( both the Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julie Cagnina .	-4.3745
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkusz could also return to the team .	-4.2572
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungarians , who was the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016 , someone from the training station around Marius Zay will be filling the cadre .	-6.8530

Moscow ’ s response was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels shame the US impetus .	-3.4602
After all , the draft envisages punishing European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-2.6351
Accordingly , investors from the local OMV have been worried since then , cofinanced with other European firms to construct the Russian Baltic Sea region Nord Stream 2 .	-5.7108
The drohculine is formidable .	-2.5345
However , it is too early to assess the consequences , as is the official statement of the oil company .	-3.8239

Cook remains out of home : a caterer performs this task and supplies fresh coats .	-6.2878
The town operates 46 children 's days in the area , 44 children receive a warm meal at lunch time .	-4.8508
In the last year , 2800 children each sat on the tables and the need constantly increases .	-5.0257
" Meanwhile , not only kids who are served 45 hours of the week in the Kita at noon , " explains Pommeranz .	-8.0990
" The offer also applies in 35-hour support when children remain until 14 p.m. " .	-4.5965
From 1 September , 46 part-time employees have cooking services : they heated the cooked dishes , supplement them with salad , crude cost and fruit , portionate the meal individually , prepare food , clean and clean the kitchen .	-9.4384
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-2.6775
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the hourly range .	-3.4738
" The kitchens are now firmly part of the kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-7.6025
" They are much more involved , and it is easier to implement educational concepts for a pedagogical idea " .	-5.6907
Because it is also a question : healthy diet and cooking lessons .	-4.6993
" The children should help prepare food " .	-1.7397
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.7361
Also for the children .	-1.3110
" You have a known force in the Kita , a person familiar with them , and not constantly changing people " .	-3.6360
This continuity is important for children .	-1.2502
The purification of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff .	-5.0865
This variant - the separation of cleaning and cooking services - besides the improvement of the quality of the kitchen service , also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of comparing the costs between its own government and foreign awards for the city , says it from the press office .	-6.8031
This is even though 46 part-time workers are recruited .	-4.2870

In a letter to the company ’ s subsidiary , GMB Scotland McVitie ’ s call on ' concerns that funding for modernization of production lines will not be promoted ' .	-5.3825
GMB-Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Committee Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply .	-8.6685
Families have worked here and the workers are concentrating heavily on the local community and the Glasgow region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.8433
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising living costs and chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence at McVitie .	-4.1905
One speaker from Pladis said : " The Tolcross Filialeiter received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , because we appreciate continued involvement in staff and trade union representatives .	-6.2876
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-3.7103
We discussed with the staff that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - to remain competitive .	-5.0326
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than <unk> 5 million in our full-cross location , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-4.5176
We fully recognise the legacy of Tolcross as a production site and , if our operations change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-4.7672

The page of La Lega likes to regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-3.1208
Paris Saint-Germain is not going to abandon her prosecution of Neymar , after giving an offer of <unk> 189 million to unravel its release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago of the world record ?	-6.2488
The sensational approach has heated the transfer window in the summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pogba returning for <unk> 89 million in the last season to Manchester United .	-5.0333
After ending , Neymar becomes the most expensive player in the world and the world ’ s highest paid professional sportsman , PSG offering wages of more than 50GBP per week .	-4.8065
Barcelona is angry about how Neymar has forced his way out , though a source close to the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to attend it since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-4.4532
But was the football world warned against this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?	-2.2364
When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.4347
" I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.2732
" We respect all clubs .	-0.7244
But if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . "	-2.9099
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG middle field player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-3.4352
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its prices for Neymar .	-3.1613

The Regensburg Domspatz report on abuses relieves the Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-3.0052
That is what the author and historian Michael Hesemann means .	-1.9594

It would be very useful to see the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret about their own omissions or their then incorrect judgment of what happened .	-5.7940
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised the fact that " double standards " were measured when reporting on violence at the cathedral .	-5.1145
On the subject of the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is ' shameful and shameful deeds ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; but the striking thing is that the ' degree of media manipulation ' , so the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Italian Bioethics Committee .	-6.6731
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-5.0952
In the interview with the Bavarian radio station , Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said : " You like to go to the church and this is a found free " .	-9.9358
She also pointed out that in her youth , " Shuts were a quite normal pedagogical means " were " to be done with free children , as I was one . "	-7.4624
They would be unfair to apply current standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.4644
In connection with the reports on abuses , Georg Ratzinger has often appeared as a pap-Bruder .	-4.9883

" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he appreciates the results of the final report .	-2.9504
What exactly is the 40-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber instructed by the Bistum Regensburg Enlightenment ?	-3.6296
In total , 547 rain shoots between 1945 and early 1990s were " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 sexual abuse .	-5.2322
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who was in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In short , it can be said that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been used by Domkapellmeister R.	-5.2803
Especially with high emotionality , punishment for pupils could be even more severe .	-4.4358
Nonetheless , contrary to many other accused , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and thus , in many cases , even though violence combined positive memories with him " .	-5.5110
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral Georg Ratzinger is relieved .	-5.3119
Mr Hesemann , the 40-page report on the ' incidents of violence in the shelters at the Regensburg Cathedral ' gives a contradictory picture of Georg Ratzinger 's Cathedral .	-5.3774
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-2.1436
On the other hand , it also appears as a cholerian and perfectionist , who has often become handy when a domspatch has not produced a top performance in music .	-6.3512
How do you view this final report as your biographer ?	-3.0890
Michael Hesemann : If you do the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report in front of you , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger comes from there .	-6.3850
He is devoted just to eight pages , and he is clearly freed from any suspicion of mediation or coexistence in terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.6796
The acts of violence at school also took place outside its scope .	-4.5088
He can only be accused of being too late or of not being taken seriously enough initial suggestions .	-4.7722
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he acted was perceived by practically all interlocutors as " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-4.5771
Thus , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , also exhibits an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " comprehensible " , as a very good-for-time teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , crafts and bonbonbons and " always relocated from children 's grapes .	-7.1468
Only a minority complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which also led to the breakdown of wrongdoing .	-5.8255
He has admitted , deeply regretted , and apologized for , that he was scarking not only with chairs and throwing the keycovenant on the ground , but also distributing earthquakes and wanting too soft boys to the hair or ears .	-10.6514
However , to his salvation , it must be said that such education methods were widely used in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , among parents as well as teachers .	-4.9474
Do you know how to breed it ?	-2.8207
Of course , I think of all of us born before 1968 .	-4.8037
I , too , have seen this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-4.3520
This , of course , is compared to what this report is about , namely the horrific sexual abuse and the acts of violence on high school .	-6.2628
The question is whether it is not rather related to his fame and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many of the media have just crashed on him . , , , and , , and , , , , , , , ,	-10.0971
On the Bavarian Pope , many who never understood him still work hastily .	-3.3708
The truth , though , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-6.8216
Much has been said in the media in connection with the report about abuse of the Regensburg Cathedral .	-7.2477
Will Georg Ratzinger also charge any kind of interaction or participation in the final report on sexual abuse ?	-3.4700
Michael Hesemann : It is absolutely clear no .	-3.1084
None of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claim to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister .	-2.5387
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.6498
" I never met to talk about it with my father or my mother , " said a person in charge for the others , " I was very embarrassing " .	-5.5104
The real problem with solving sexual abuse has been and is that most victims of shame are silent .	-4.6401
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and siblings , they certainly did not become a leader of the chorus , who would have been professionally a colleague of the perpetrators .	-5.6416
How would the Cathedral Ratzinger assess the role of abuses ?	-4.3392
Michael Hesemann : A student put it like : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) could have had timely insights and had held the perpetrator .	-5.7119
I think it is also a really absurd to think that it is the reason why he / she has created a penetration or a clearer or even more , than to her parents , boarding heads , trust teachers etc .	-10.8887
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable ' .	-2.9354
For example , the report has come to the very clear result : ' The fact that it entrusted to pupils and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation ' .	-6.6481
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any co-knowledge .	-4.0842
Nor can he be accused of not preventing or placing him in the record .	-7.0348
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these unfortunate crimes , as happened in some cases .	-3.6091
In the media there was a lot of " violence texts " to read at the Regensburg domain .	-4.2482
The former Cathedral , Georg Ratzinger , is accused of " wegschauen " in the report .	-4.5974
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.2027
Michael Hesemann : This is the major problem , after all , that everything has been mixed up and mixed up in the reporting as a gigantic melange of sexual abuse and violence texts , and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-7.0577
Yet this is precisely what is in turn an abuse of the report .	-3.7017
The fact is that it is neatly separated : between pre-school and the gymnasium of the cathedral , between sexual abuse and violence texts and , let us say , other accusations .	-5.4999
In addition , the report deals with incidents since 1945 , even for four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not chief chorus of the Cathedral .	-4.8445
The whole horrific canoeing pedagogy , the cases in which Kaben of Sadist teachers were regularly harassed and depicted , and suffered appalling , all occurred on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions have to be prevented .	-8.0075
But with them , the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do , because he got the boys to face only when they were already on the dominant gymnasium .	-5.5534
On which , like most witnesses , the subject of " pre-school " was tabu .	-2.9301
It was only happy to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-3.5413
What , then , was different on the dome gymnasium ?	-3.3661
Michael Hesemann : Although there was discipline , there was no sadistic violence here .	-3.8390
And that also applies to George Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and thus , in many cases , even if violence combines positive memories with him ' .	-5.1995
At most , the accusation of having gone away is still the case .	-6.8672
Despite all the efforts , however , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by pre-school conditions .	-3.9095
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the predecessors at a school where he was not active and responsible ( thus the witness ) nothing wanted to hear , and then again around 1993 .	-6.5264
Is Georg Ratzinger consistently listening to the state ?	-2.7942
Michael Hesemann : No , because since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.3531
In this he points out that ' the practice of caning penalty continues in pre-school ' . the are .	-6.0468
He recommended urgent intervention even in the face of the risk of negative press releases .	-2.9781
That was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when caning penalties were long banned in Bavaria .	-6.6149
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-4.0375
It was difficult to estimate for him too , where the parties concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible border had really been exceeded .	-5.9068
One cannot say that he always looked away .	-3.5769
That is simply not true .	-0.9005
It was only in 1980 that the caning punishment at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-2.6697
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis said that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to the time .	-3.8986
How do you see this ?	-1.4657
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " fall-string of anachronism " , in other words , the risk of evaluating the past according to current moral standards .	-5.0431
The princes are quite right here .	-2.5403
This does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times , nor to what was buried in pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children 's seasons , far beyond that of the usual .	-8.1548
That is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally being prepared .	-3.8798
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all of this had nothing to do with him .	-2.8272
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say slaughtering and listening to the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970 ’ s .	-4.9984
When physical punishment was then banned , he was strictly adhered to it .	-3.0525
What kind of image of his Regensburg time did Georg Ratzinger play in talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-3.8554
Does the issue of caning penalty also matter ?	-3.2350
Michael Hesemann : Well , in the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedicts XVI , tells from his perspective , because the domgrots played only a side role .	-4.7612
I do not conceal , however , that he led a strict regime there .	-5.2503
But that also has to be said : without this perfectionism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would probably have been hard for him to form an institution of world-class racing from the so far known Regensburg Cathedral , true cultural boss of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-8.1952
With boilers and bonbons alone , you ’ ll never be able to stand up to the big singers and before every success , whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self-reliance .	-8.0218
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-2.8203
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and have seen them all over again as wonderful , humorous , basic , deeply faithful , and hearty people , from which one cannot imagine that even one fly might do something .	-8.2393
I regularly get to him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-4.5891
Those who have not yet forgiven him that he has been tough with them are therefore clearly in a minority .	-4.8275
Most doms are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .	-3.2100
And that he was always a good , fathernal teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but it was also a lovely spectrum , to which they are still looking up and eating them straight away .	-8.0086
I would ask you once again to make it very clear that everything you accuse him of is educational methods which were on the agenda at the time .	-5.7539
We can be glad that we have long since overcome this time .	-2.9866
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat .	-3.1935
It is all too obvious that there is the bad intention behind it .	-3.6736
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-4.5731
Now , the decency would be a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merit and would not be able to get into peace without the outside Bavaria and maybe Germany .	-13.8324
