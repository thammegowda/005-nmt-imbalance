Gutach : Even more safety for pedestrians	-1.6315
There is no 100 meters away from each other . On Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian pedestrian lights were taken in Gutach at the village parking place - in the view of the older town hall samples .	-6.0672
Two equipment so close : Is it intended or cancelled ?	-3.7377
This question was clearly answered by Gutach 's mayor yesterday .	-1.8394
" The town hall light was installed at the time because it secures the school path " , explained corner yesterday .	-3.4805
The cluster traffic lights safe both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain residents .	-3.3994
The facility , which was officially operated yesterday , is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crossing area .	-3.3653
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.0207
" At the high traffic and pedestrian revenue , a further traffic light had to be secured , " said corner .	-4.5558
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Council .	-1.8876
" According to current measurements , around 12 000 vehicles are going through on the B 33 every day , Arnold emphasises the community of Gutach , about 10 % of heavy traffic .	-5.6553
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is here simply before , " said Arnold .	-4.3020
Overall , four traffic shows were carried out , a roundabout was also considered , but again rejected because of the closure in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crossing .	-5.1437
According to Arnold , in the choice of traffic light masts , everything was tested above : " By means of an extra long wooden tribes of loaded transporters , we have equipped whether these vehicles can exit to the B 33 , without changing the traffic masts . "	-16.0669
The approximately EUR 15 000 traffic lights themselves is the " most modern thing there is on the market " , explained Arnold .	-4.2058
The system is equipped with coloured LEDs , which are so powerful that the lights of drivers , for example , are well recognized in deep sunshine .	-5.1312
And it is also economical : the older light systems consume about 100 watts , the new eight watts .	-4.6743
There are three light systems per direction .	-2.1269
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.3392
If the pedestrian pushes the traffic light button , the upof radar sensor te a traffi situ. a of the of the .	-19.2764
If the road is free , it comes immediately to the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-15.4844
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be ended for the pedestrian .	-2.6936
" If a group or disabled persons go over the street , the green phase is extended , so everyone is sure about the motorway , " Arnold explained .	-4.9241
Of course , drivers must think here as a partner and observe the road .	-4.0494
This was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the pedestrian pedestrians , robbed a upper class vehicle - with bright red .	-4.5772
Josef Winkler has been writing the soul for more than 30 years .	-2.0967
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the language , the slope to raw violence and sexuality , the narrow and joylessness - has often described the Carinthian poet .	-4.7430
The Büchner prize winner is known above all as a prosauthor , theater texts are rare in his work .	-3.9555
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher provides for his performance " weather lights on the tongue " , which is now available in Garage X at Petersplatz , therefore composed a collage of prosatixes .	-5.9885
The theatremaker connects elements from the auto-biographical novel " The Leibeigene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminatures from " Leichnam , his family laughing " ( 2003 ) .	-3.4332
On the largely empty stage - important requisite : a fragmented sofa that is copulated and masturbated by the eight-headed ensemble by the text material .	-4.6241
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text in this mind .	-12.3837
The 70-minute performance overtakes the template with a variety of regional incidents , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms .	-4.0105
Above all , the actors come from sometimes somewhat doubtful scenic implementation .	-15.7521
They are tough encountered , divided with the head under water , tackled with their evening robes to the wstre.	-13.1451
Constrained in cellophane or renter , they stack on dangerously high stocks through the staging , either monologize them loudly or lying completely dammed on the stage floor .	-13.8460
However , the text hardly conveys itself in this effortless wany way   . much muc of the teask is made much mistaken   ununun	-16.7545
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folklore lying good .	-13.3754
Only against the end will the overwhelming performance come somewhat calm , and anglers flash up absurd humour .	-16.5123
A Blackbox on the car ?	-1.7092
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling Highway system , and believe that the solution is found in a small black caste that is seated in the armature board of each car .	-15.0235
The devices that record every kilometre driven and report information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the Federal Planning Offices to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads .	-4.1571
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intensive debate with colorful alliances .	-3.3153
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and are in favour of the government being able to use small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax modes .	-4.7907
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.0392
The American Civil Law Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-1.9182
But while Congress cannot agree on an action , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.9662
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system over the next decade , where drivers pay per driven mile .	-3.7300
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.2698
That really is a must for our country .	-1.3972
“ It is nothing that we may only use , ” Hasan Ikhrata said , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments planning a record of the driven miles in all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .	-4.2402
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.4071
The technology is there .	-1.9004
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , funded from taxes paid by US Americans at the pillar , is failed .	-15.1161
But America no longer tanks as much as it did before .	-3.0411
Cars use less petrol .	-1.2290
The government oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone ( less than 4 Eurocent per litre ) has not risen for 20 years .	-2.9183
Politicians dare not dare to raise taxes even by a cent in high prices .	-2.8999
“ The gasoline tax is simply not able to future , ” said Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-12.4183
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.5490
“ This is the long-term alternative , ” he said .	-1.8206
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-1.7799
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberal acceptance is found , for example , because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-harmful exhaust gases .	-4.6220
The Californian planners are placing on the system in drawing up strategies to achieve the ambitious , legally enshrined goals of the Federal State on climate change .	-4.6839
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he sees the most viable long-term alternative .	-2.8748
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also due to the idea of paying drivers after returned route .	-3.9832
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President for Reason Directiv s.	-13.7095
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.1604
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who called on Congress in a 2011 report to move towards mile-based accounting .	-3.3842
Last year the US Senate approved a $ 90 million of expensive pilot project , covering 10,000 cars .	-2.7459
However , the majority in the House of Representatives prevented push forward and responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who often need to put many miles on the road to work or to the city in the every .	-24.8967
Nevertheless , several states and large cities are moving in this direction .	-3.7501
Oregon is most committed to acquiring 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country .	-3.3071
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of the oil tax to the state .	-2.5656
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.0356
New York City also considers such a . !!, ! !	-11.6932
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .	-2.2803
And the I-95 coalition , including the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-3.0593
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.0812
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with devices , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue each of their movements .	-3.1750
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” says Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada .	-3.1680
People did not want it .	-1.3190
When the test started , the ACLU warned Nevada on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to transform the tachographs into adult surveillance devices . ”	-3.8381
There is no need to build a massive , locked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-2.8123
Nevada belongs to a number of states that now look for affordable technology , with which the state can capture the dangerous kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-15.5215
In doing so , Khan , the public would be more reassured .	-2.8001
Hunting after this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-1.8861
The company was not originally responsible for helping states tax drivers .	-3.0878
Instead , it was their goal to set foot in an emerging market for vehicle insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of the dangerous miles .	-4.4927
But the devices it tests are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is uploaded regularly by modem .	-3.6520
“ People are more prepared to take part if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-2.5886
Some of these pilot programs have made great mistakes .	-2.1570
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-1.6511
In Oregon , the planners experiment with giving drivers a range of selection options .	-3.1299
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.5039
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat fee on the basis of the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state .	-3.5376
Others hope to sell the concept of a mistrustful public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less .	-2.8654
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a tax device that also pays parking fees , insurance must be paid only for dangerous kilometres and speed data from other vehicles in real time thanks to which drivers can evade congestion .	-5.4653
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages offered by the system , ” it says in a city planning document .	-3.2682
Some transport planners , however , wonder whether the whole talk about paying for each mile is not just a huge diversion .   a    a  a a     a	-15.5740
In the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay officials said that Congress could simply solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel taxes .	-3.1575
An additional one-off fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol so that they also pay a fair share .	-3.2667
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Renschler , head of legislation and public affairs of the Commission .	-3.3110
When we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and numer! !	-14.6911

After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two respiratory protectors of the water were prepared to enter the building .	-4.5345
After a short time , it managed to find the first person and lead to the free .	-3.2343
The second person had to be borne .	-1.5819
This was not so easy as there was also a close staircase to overcome .	-3.5534
The building , a workshop with an integrated stallation for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-1.9871
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it .	-2.8557
There were also electric machines for wood processing .	-2.4334
The first deletion attack was carried out by the tank in the vehicle .	-2.7074
Another management took place through an overflower hydrant at about 100 meters distance .	-3.9406
Three attacks could now be deleted .	-2.6067
A high beam tube was also used in the building .	-2.9972

Networking of universities and companies important	-10.5873
On his visit to the Breisgau High Black Forest , Guido Wolf , land-day President Guido Wolf could also explain where tomorrow 's workers come from .	-6.4440
In the University of Black Forest , he joined the managing directors of the professional schools and the circle gymnasium and the parental working chairman of this important question .	-5.4095
" Education is an important factor " , underscored Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , which presented the networked school project Education Centre High Black Forest .	-12.0799
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education .	-2.8687
Since 2011 there has been successful cooperation between support centre , circle gymnasium and professional school centre .	-3.5667
He also praised family friendliness in the country .	-2.8105
" It is important not only to have the family phase in mind , but also to demographic change the phase for maintaining members ' care , said Wolf .	-4.4070
He also carried out increasing numbers of employees concerning the care and care of their families .	-4.7607
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the working relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.1397
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers , he continued to shol.	-4.2887
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-1.8715
" Because who has already met the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and his abilities often receive the regional economy , which contributes to strengthening the region , " the President of the Agriculture showed himself convinced .	-5.1552

The over 100 years old natural stone walls as the front delivery of the old school court to the church road will be replaced with the refurbishment costs of the city Braunlingen .	-6.2119
During the days before the Kilbig , a small angle wall , stabilization and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrade was installed in the first work of the front school courtyat .	-14.4033
The continued approach , such as Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger City Building Office , is to include the National Ministry in the planning and to create a refreshing concept for the old wall .	-5.8234
Afterwards , a cost calculation is to be made by professionals who will then be put on the table to the Council for the decision and definition of the further procedure .	-5.2909
A decision on this will probably already be taken next year  .	-3.4219
Following the rehabilitation , plastering and tree planting of the old school inner court within the two side wings of the 1912 school , the foreseeable follow-up measure must be refurbished and placed on new subsidiaries .	-5.6307
The historical , one hundred years old delimitation wall of the old school house to the church road , is mainly through water and frost damage , since there is no drainage , needs to be renovated and has an archery forward .	-5.9649
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is not currently unthreatened any more .	-21.9826
A standard wall is a prerequisite for a school court used by students , which has been done through the current fortification work .	-4.3440
Originally , schoolhouse renovation was even planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure shifted .	-3.6872
An important word in historical school walls , which has even been used for film recordings , will be participating in the National Ministry .	-4.7333
Should targets come from this site , the city hopes to grants from the monument protectors .	-4.8172
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school , who are now being informed in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula , can soon use the old school house .	-4.6849

Jazz and classics are part of the Stuttgart Jazz location .	-3.1422
This contradicts Özdemir , who is considered to be a favorite for a direct mandate in the federal election on 22 September , the Green Red Government .	-4.7300
This forces on the basis of an expert study to reorganise the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.5512
Afterwards , the study entrance Jazz and Pop will be relocated from the Stuttgart music school to Mannat .	-18.3540
US Border : " Super Tunnel " for Drug Smuggling	-3.2811
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and closed a super tunnel to drug smuggling .	-2.6992
As the US customs authorities informed , more than 500 metres of tubes between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity , rail tracks and ventilation system .	-4.0167
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of Marihuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated .	-2.0296
According to the tunnel , it was not used yet .	-1.9997
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could go through under the radar , " said the US District General Prosecutor of Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in San Diego , where this was an end to the tunnel .	-4.1549
Duffy applied to the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.5636
Both the US authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against drug cartels .	-1.8227
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-1.9269
Constructed by experts	-1.5220
Because of the extensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took roughly a year .	-3.4535
The track was equipped with electrically powered cars .	-4.0933
On the Mexican side there is access to a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-2.8737
According to the authorities , a head of 20 meters leads to the depth of the tunnel entrance .	-3.4325
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres and 90 centimetres width .	-2.1246
It would have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-2.5624
Two suspects were arrested in connection with the Kokain-Fund .	-2.3552
The third , a Mexican , was taken due to the confiscated Marihuana .	-2.9215
All three three threatens the maximum punishment of life long , as civil servants have said .	-10.4328
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , it continued at the press conference in San Diego .	-2.2484
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel building .	-2.4080
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not tunnels .	-12.0171
This shows the " despair " of drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA in San Diego .	-3.5984
They would do everything possible to reach the US .	-1.9278
No details were announced on the arrested , at least one Mexican , said .	-3.7429
They must count on prison sentences up to ten years .	-2.1096

Hostages and church houses were first mentioned in 794 together .	-3.2000
A certificate was made in churches where both places are mentioned .	-2.5404
On March 15 , there is to be an official anniversary , and as hostages have no hall at the moment , this event takes place in the place where both were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago , in Church houses .	-5.9229
In the anniversary several events are planned both in hostages and in church houses .	-19.1528
Church houses will be 1250 in July on a weekend from July 18th to 20th .	-4.0061
Celebrate again .	-2.7035
On Friday with a festival , Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall .	-3.2688
On this weekend , the church house festival is also the church festival .	-4.0551
Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary that is listed on three dates .	-3.8382
On June 21 , together with the Black Forest Association Sunweaver , 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and 13 December as the first concert of town music in the new Festhalle .	-5.1312
This will be ready and inaugurated during the anniversary , the official deadline is on September 27 and 28 .	-4.2360
On the occasion of the Geisinger Stadtjubilee , a new chronic is also emerged .	-4.6890
" But it should be a chronic not only of hostages themselves , but a printed work about the hostages of today , which consists of just hostages , church houses , body horses , aulfings and gutmadings , " said Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-6.0933
And today ’ s hostage celebrates 2014 birthday , in 1974 today ’ s space was carried out with the communities .	-3.8428
The new chronicle will then be presented in the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-3.3646
2014 is also a year with many anniversaries .	-2.6725
Strohglonki football starts on February 8th with a custom revenue at its 60th anniversary , the harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and will celebrate the fiesta banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-6.9208
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the Geisinger Schule has been at the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates it in the framework of the fountain festival from July 4th to 7th .	-4.8361
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation certificate that is owned by the St. Gallen monastery in 764 .	-20.4018
The certificate was made in churches ( houses ) , which was then the court .	-3.0296
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same certificate .	-2.0629
Because 2014 celebrates this 1250 year old , in addition , the communal reform is 40 years back .	-4.5872
Council Guidelines	-3.0477
Should the transition " Am Hirschen " be constantly rebuilt to increase road safety ?	-3.5426
Yes , the municipalities have decided .	-1.5065
Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 into account .	-2.5823
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway route next year .	-2.5951
Particularly in order to increase the safety of rail crossings - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout the country .	-5.8925
If the communities agree to the rebuilding measures , they have to participate in the cost of a third , the rest share railways and covenants in the the resof of of of of of the .	-18.7941
Schiltach 's City Championship Roland Grießer explained the specificities of the Council ' Am Hirschen ' .	-4.6504
There , the city plans to build a booking in the amount of the tunnel mountain on the west of the railway track .	-5.6788
There , too , larger vehicles , for example those transporting longhold , could stand by counter-traffic without having to block the track .	-15.1278
Big holders therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-4.9982
This was controversial in the Council because some Councils doubted the need for road spread : Thomas Kipp brought the mood of critics to the point : ' Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles ? '	-4.7476
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : The transition " Hirschen " was used regularly for longholt transports .	-3.6328
Even wood from the Kuhbach area is partly transported over this route , because the vehicles of up to 20 metres could not use the route on the Häberlesbridge because they could not turn into the main road .	-5.4967
Moreover , the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that may not use the tunnel if the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.7148
It should be said that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated , as is the case in Wolfach today , an important transport meaning could also be achieved for a longer period of time .	-20.4688
The Councils agreed to investigate the costs intended to expand the road .	-3.5439
Nevertheless , the majority of the transition was agreed to the rebuilding of the railway transition , with the measure that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city will then expand the subsequent road towards " Railway Street " if necessary for meeting transport at around 5.5 meters .	-7.0086
By contrast , the transition to the Trautwin railway station could lead to a completely different problem concerning the access to the heavily rising " geroltzhäus  " at the moment .	-16.0102
The administration had investigated the reconstruction plans of the Breinlinger Engineering Office , as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was still possible without any further possibility .	-4.7107
The study came to the conclusion that it was not to be excluded that the road ’ s inclination could lead to longer vehicles sitting .	-3.8553
The responsibility for this is again the city as a street carrier .	-4.2513
The reconstruction could therefore result in liabilities .	-3.0605
Because both the wood and turning work in the current development state , Haas did not agree to the reconstruction of the transition .	-5.4487
At this point too , the risk of a collision of train with a transition vehicle much less than the other train passes , because there is directly next to the centre stopping point , with a good vision connection .	-16.9805
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be braked at this point as far as no collision is concerned .	-4.4840
Most of the time agreed to rebuild this transition , since the city of Schiltach would have to " break " the problem with supervisory vehicles , as the Council could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work has been completed .	-6.1501
As unproblematic , the body considers the rebuildings to the transitions " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway .	-4.6069
Esa decides on big space missions : Missions for billions	-10.3584
Far remote planets , gravitation waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to start over the next few years .	-3.3022
There were 30 proposals for choice , five are still in the race .	-3.1279
Far Worlds .	-1.2497
More than 1000 planets for other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.0764
Whether there are at least some of them , nobody knows .	-1.9852
The selection is hard : should you search for gravitation waves ?	-2.9100
Or rather explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-1.7732
Or took planets to discover extraordinary life , perhaps discover!	-15.6143
These questions are the responsible of the European Space Agency Esa .	-2.6561
For their programme " Cosmic Vision " , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that should decisively advance research .	-3.5982
The budget for such ' L missions ' is approximately EUR 1 billion .	-2.0213
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-2.0537
In early September , Paris met the elite of European space research in order to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.2994
30 ideas were discussed , five of them have now come into the closer election .	-2.7944
Many bodies examine the proposals , according to the researchers .	-3.3072
Over the next few days , the scientific committee will make a final decision .	-2.9228
Overall , four major questions have chosen Esa to find answers to the missions of the Cosmic Vision initiated in 2007 .	-3.4300
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life ?	-1.9160
The exact transactions in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planet circling these stars - are still in the speaking dark .	-5.6080
A big infrared telescope in all may penetrate this dark .	-2.6352
And if a star planet has , under what circumstances can life arise there ?ever a a !!!!!!!!!!!!	-12.5162
In order to deal with this question , 2017 will start the space telescope " Cheops " , which will investigate 500 already known planetary systems in our closer surroundings .	-4.8651
But the possibilities are limited , cheops are a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.4010
With larger instruments , astronomers could map similar planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , seeking " biomarkers " : gases regarding biological activity .	-3.8247
How does the sun system work ?	-1.4716
This question should also ultimately include the conditions for the creation of life .	-4.0434
An important role is played by the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field , as well as the particle radiation with the planetary system that he out .	-21.2373
In our solar system , these processes can be examined in an exem  ununder unun until the !	-15.1617
With the " Solar Orbiter " the Esa has already granted a M class mission ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this question .	-3.9486
The song will start in 2017 and watch the surface and activity of the sun .	-4.1828
Jupiters and his fashion are of great interest to researchers . even Ju!	-13.0051
They want to find out what role the huge planet played in the development of the sun system .	-3.1976
For this , the Esa provides the first of the total three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " programme .	-3.4442
The sonde " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) probably begins their journey in 2022 .	-2.6546
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and shall examine the atmosphere of the planet , as well as the icy moon Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.7954
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.1852
The world offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the well-known nature laws are still valid there .	-3.3867
Perhaps there are also differences that could pass the path towards a new theory under which all the well-known natural laws can be combined .	-5.0705
How did the universe emerge and what is it ?	-2.9706
13.7 billion years ago our cosmos emerged through the bank .	-3.3196
In addition to the matter we are running , from stars , planets and living beings like us , there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters , and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of the world .	-5.3251
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the breakdown , nor dark matter and dark energy .	-3.3397
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved an M mission whose launch is scheduled for 2020 .	-4.2809
With a special telescope , the special telescope is to investigate the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time , enabling conclusions on the nature of darker matter and darker energy .	-4.5969
Who Could Do the Race	-2.8841
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain left at the end of the selection process   .	-14.9895
The best opportunities for granting as a L-mission have , in the opinion of many experts , " e-lisa " , an ambitious concept to prove gravity waves .	-5.1698
Among these , physicists understand changes in the space time structure that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-3.2276
They have not been proven to date .	-1.9838
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-2.1925
The mission provides for an existing detector consisting of two or three transactions , which is stationed in all .	-3.9056
In contrast to plants on Earth , he could also prove gravitational waves that have emerged from the base , and thus provide new knowledge of the cosmos .	-6.3834
Four other proposals compete with the second L mission : a great X-ray cop called " Athena " , which is intended to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the external planet of the sun system , " prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is to track and examine thorough planets .	-6.4071
Sample proposals on the transport of samples from Mars , research into moon , venus and asteroids , as well as sunphysics .	-4.4671
Snowden is ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance	-2.1078
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has declared that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and to say before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities .	-4.5975
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-3.0888
In a letter from Snowden , presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat different opinions as loyalty and tries to criminalize political expression with criminal threat where no defence is possible . ”	-5.3643
But the truth is not a crime .	-1.3866
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American Government to fall against him .	-3.6403
The charge made by the US Department of Justice includes spionage and theft of state property .	-2.9242
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said about time online : “ If Mr Snowden is ready to speak to German representatives , then we find ways to make this possible . ”	-3.6322
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that NSA has listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel 's mobile phone .	-3.0486
Thomas Opermann , the Member who is leading the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , declared that the opportunity to listen to Snowden as witnesses if this is possible to “ jeopardise it and completely ruin relations with the US . ”	-4.7878
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published an image of itself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-3.1454
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.2613
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-2.9343
When Snowden says in Germany , he then needs a pledge that he is “ safe ” there , the Member .	-16.2305
Snowden explains in his letter that he faced a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that displaced him from his home .	-3.2291
But he is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.3109
Citizens around the world and high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit of general interest .	-12.0669
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ when the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-2.5665
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-1.8021
Frontier Airlines is planning to demand up to $ 100 of passenger passengers who want to build up on their flight baggage .	-13.9797
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade , even though it was announced on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-12.5273
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment over the site , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-3.5732
Frontier explained that if the charge is paid in advance , USD 100 for travellers paid only at the flight .	-4.9286
Frontier spokesman Kate O 'Malley said that the charge of $ 100 is aimed at moving travellers to care in advance of payment .	-3.4310
“ We do not wish to calculate that amount , ” she explained .	-2.2922
Airlines began in 2008 to charge for the first and second baggage piece .	-2.9076
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stopped as much as possible into hand baggage , which means that baggage subjects are often overcrowded over the seat .	-5.0153
Fees are a way to move passengers to board less .	-2.1490
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-2.2338
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who made it clear that it would be increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment over the seat .	-4.5625
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .  ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!	-12.9515
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of baggage free of charge while the next person may pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .	-4.4491
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed about the charge before they could get to the flight .	-3.4208
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier only comes into force in summer , and there is no exact date .	-4.0677
Passengers often baggage supplements and other charges , but airlines are happy to return to them .	-3.3187
They argue that transporting baggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish it .	-2.7729
Many on Wall Street regard the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-3.1016
However , most of them have so far left the fingers of hand baggage .	-3.4311
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded a first charge for hand baggage and later Allegiant Air , also a cheap flight .	-6.7935
The only other airline company with such a charge is Hungarian Wizz Air , declared the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who followed the additional fees closely .	-4.4220
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand baggage fee Spirit introduces $ 50 million a year .	-3.2259
Sorensen , who had a leadership position at Midwest Airlines , recently fled with spirit and was curious what would expect him to get passengers faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-4.6118
“ The Boarding Process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .   a !	-14.3205
I expected to see teeth ridges and handcrafted discussions on the road .	-4.0488
“ The aircraft was full , ” he said , “ and the boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-2.1338
Frontier also follows the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.7311
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or Juice who are likely to retain the whole cup and that coffee would be filled free of charge .	-5.0914
Water is still free .	-1.2934
US Airways tried briefly in 2008 to request money for refreshment drinks , but reversed it seven months later after passengers had complained and had not drawn up another large society .	-4.6355
Frontier ’ s step to charge hand baggage charges if passengers do not buy directly to the airline is the latest initiative to guide their own website .	-4.2922
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per selled ticket .	-2.7639
This provides an incentive for all societies to move passengers to direct purchase with them rather than through an online travel agency .	-3.9182
Frontier , however , has gone further in this area .	-2.9750
In September , the company began to award only half as many flying miles in reservation through an online travel agency .	-3.7853
On Wednesday , the miles were once again reduced to 25 % of the route .	-2.7622
A third-party flight trip with Frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only introduce 250 miles .	-3.9485
Passengers can also book only for direct purchase on the Frontier Square website .	-3.2675
Frontier has a faithful customer base at his headquarters in Denver , but the business shrinks and the company loses mobudgets .        a a  a !	-13.0378

Well 40 women visited the last women 's breakfast this year in the evangelical community of Bisingen .	-14.8370
The topic of the day in the municipality was " speakers from the Bible " and " Middle Ages speeches " .	-3.7199
Zita Köhler , chairman of the Church Council , went to the Biblical sayings after breakfast .	-3.3658
" Sayings contain lifestyles , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-13.3312
She compared several sayings with the corresponding bibles and explained the importance .	-3.7980
She called proverbs like : wood eyes are vigilant , as shoes fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone , the Lord 's hands in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-5.7693
Several times , the speaker advised her listeners to what proverb was .	-14.9490
The Middle Ages ’ speeches were adopted by the church community Christel Dehner : all good things are three , blue , something watched .	-4.2925

NSA explains that an “ internal error ” rather than hacker are guilty of the site ’ s crash	-3.1245
The shady National Security Agency declared late Friday , a mistake has slowed its public website some hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-4.2163
“ NSA.gov was not accessible for hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in an e-mail message .	-4.3349
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.3689
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.3558
Online server trackers found in the early evening that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours , and that is not for some users .	-4.4767
Before that , a NSA spokesman against ABC News declared that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ no way ” compromised .	-14.3512
Secret information is not at risk , so the speaker .	-1.6231
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.7222
Such attacks overflow the target website with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site breaks down .	-3.1703
The cybertactic is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system .	-2.8866
The former supersecret NSA , whose top name was once No Such Agency ( no such authority ) , is now found in the bright light of the public , looking after the well-known revelations about its extensive surveillance program in domestic and foreign sharp criticism – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-5.7760
The growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-3.5969

Income from Bombardier after decrease in numbers and orders	-3.3798
The Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc , on Thursday , reported a 15-percent decline in net profit after pressured by declining orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in rail savings .	-4.9099
Bombardier , located in Montreal , did not publish air tests for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not give new information about whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-4.7847
Only three further starts were followed at the test aircraft one and a half months ago , which questionably makes the test phase as planned .	-5.5570
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a fall of more than eight percent of the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-3.7149
Cameron Doerksen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his assessment of “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” with a view to the next one to two quarters a limited course potential .	-3.8876
“ While weaker aircraft delivery payments were largely expected , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-3.9992
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the aircraft test program is moving forward .	-3.1220
But if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical of the programme .	-3.1510
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.5529
The first test aircraft was presented in March of the public and flew for the first time in September after months of delay .	-2.8624
But up to now binding orders for the CSeries are 177 moderate , as potential buyers wait for the results of the airline tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings potential are appropriate for the new noise aircraft .	-5.2238
There are currently 403 orders and commitments of 15 customers and companies .	-1.9002
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-2.9651
The company ’ s management also insured Thursday compared to analysts and media , the programme is in the appointment plan .  !	-14.9988
“ The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the aircraft ’ s period was land tests and software updates .	-4.1972
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.7679
We have decided to make a first flight and then add a revision period , which we have done .	-3.0352
This is happening throughout the flight programme .	-1.8860
The second of five test aircraft will probably launch in the next few weeks , the remaining short afterwards , said by the company .	-5.1374
Nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical about whether twelve months after the first customer ’ s virgin flight , the first customer can operate an aircraft of the CSeries  a fli   .	-13.1559
Bombardier explained that it reviews the planning for start-up ( EIS ) and will update them in the coming months .	-3.0251
“ The slow advance of the airline test – even if it appears to be in line with Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will shift to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-4.0359
In the third quarter , with the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net gain fell to $ 147 million and 8 cents per share of $ 172 million or 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-3.9014
The customized profit per share is 9 cent unchanged .	-17.2102
Sales were slightly gradual and dropped from 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .	-3.0194
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , said Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.7900
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer , delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-2.6401

The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light	-15.3168
He was condemned to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-2.4361
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation , because he feared that his secret drug addiction could be discovered , was sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.6001
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on drug trafficking activities after compromising his own cocaine addiction .	-2.9732
Criminalists ’ “ first-class ” lawyer with the top name “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after supervising the Scarborough police represented in an earlier drug procedure .	-17.3154
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while they were at a food of the lawyer chamber .	-4.4030
The investigations brought that Ditta regularly consumed drugs of class A after traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and credit cards were found .	-4.3574
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.5099
All four suspects were monitored by the police in the framework of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-2.9994
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police secured a number of house searches Heroin and Cocain worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash .	-4.3909
Ditta , 42 , gave information to criminals further because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .	-3.0135
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found and condemned at Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two charges for handicapped justice .	-4.0852
He gave cocaine ownership during an earlier survey .	-3.3343
The lawyer was transferred after the police investigated against Scarborough that it had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 201 .	-3.4930
Two investigative officials followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas House and there put drugs at 60 % in a black golf glove under the lawyer ’ s garbage .	-4.8722
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs , telephoned Scarborough regularly with Ditta , who was in the dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-12.1155
The lawyer returned home , the drugs took off and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-2.9590
Ditta was known to have been a “ regular consumer ” by cocaine after tests drugs of class A were discovered in his hair , his wallet , and on his credit cards .	-4.4604
Ditta was arrested later , but disputed to take cocaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that her discussion was subject to “ lawyer secrecy . ”	-3.7431
During his arrest , Ditta took his letter bag and tried to remove a series of credit cards , but they were ensured and a hair test was taken off .	-4.6213
At the police authority he gave him an office and client would call him at home for legal affairs , both under his private address and at the workplace .	-5.1925
It was known before the Court that he called for significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them .	-4.3337
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ A lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not breaking . ”	-3.0111
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , as he has received too much with certain clients .	-3.7476
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug trafficker , but of a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-2.9897
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-2.9570
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.4421
He continued to work towards police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to follow their criminal activities .	-4.2435
Mr Ditta therefore brought his profession in disrepute .	-2.4484
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed him to compromise his independence .	-2.5384
Ditta referred to any misconduct of itself and claimed : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer what I am not and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , then I would not wait for 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-4.8275
But after the hearing Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals . ”	-3.2447
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-3.7671
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure trust and confidence in the public .	-2.0867
Ditta has fallen behind this confidence and tried to take hold behind the facade of his profession .	-4.3815
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire headed the investigations against Ditta , which also led to condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial disability , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-3.6533
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that none of the arm of the law can escape .	-2.2746
We will find you and bring you to court .	-2.2245
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after guilty of the conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-3.2422
Five-thirty other people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to the total prison of 153 years for drug offences .	-3.7122
Ditta published an area of questions and answers on his website where he indicated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest when dinner is Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-4.6936
Revolutionary Work of Church Music	-0.9852
At the end of the celebration of the occasion of its 160-year-old existence , Dunningen will frame two god services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.6594
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which the spectators enthusiastically enthusiastic this spring , the songwriter will enrich two God 's services with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert .	-4.7716
On Saturday , 26 October , this extraordinary exhibition will be heard from 19 at the evening exhibition in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 October , from 10.15 a.m. at the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf .	-4.4874
The so-called Deutsche Fair with the original title " Sänge zur Feier des Holy Victims der Messe " , D 872 , is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert in 1826 and was currently considered almost revolutionary at the time of emergence .	-5.7227
The exhibition is listed in the context of God 's services , as Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-3.3767
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ by the Blaser group of the Musikverein .	-4.2179
Haslach : Skepticism Moving ScepPPS SCS SCSS SCSSSS Sk	-15.0940
With the 2015 parish council elections , for example , Haslach ( SE ) will change fundamental importance .	-3.1784
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes . therethere is thethea paris!!!par!!!!!!!!!	-15.0584
At a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach were preparing for changes .	-3.4251
After all , the diocese 's fundamental decisions are nothing more to change and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.5545
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear : scepticism towards the New is hesitant , but increasingly confident .	-4.9755
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to specific proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council , the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsorgeteam were enough .	-4.6251
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the newly established guidelines for seafarers units in the Archdiocese Freiburg .	-3.3236
Afterwards , the SE Haslach , as a church community , is a corporation of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so far .	-4.2245
There will only be a common parish council and a board of Foundation representing the parish office .	-4.1352
From each parish , at least two elected members are to be represented , in the six parishes are formed on the ground .	-5.2397
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future .	-2.3556
When asked about the finances of the individual parish community , there was considerable need for talks .	-4.0004
The innovations provide for accumulated credit to be maintained in the pharmaceutical states respeunder the of the legal of in the of the of of of the of the pof the of the of the	-20.7573
The liabilities go against the community as a whole .	-2.6872
There has been great concern , particularly with regard to the major investments that have been planned , whose commitment then affects all parishes .	-5.3396
" Even in the past , only projects that could be managed by the individual parishes alone , " relativated Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-4.6486
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Ritter , the chairman of the Southern Forest Neuried .	-7.1753
They had done their job in 2006 , " One , five will remain " , and they had to realise that it is not so easy .	-5.1124
The bodies of the Haslach Seelsory Unit then answered questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-4.6803
Developments will be concretised during further meetings and adopted at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-3.9585
In the end , Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Soul Unit , which was accepted by a clear majority .	-4.1849
In Pfullendorf , the electricity becomes more expensive	-2.1794
The citizens of Pfullendorfs must adjust to higher electricity costs .	-11.0961
As the managing director of the city works , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed against the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pfullendorf family will become 70 to 90 Euros a year .	-5.0200
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC turnover from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-14.6635
This environment is redefined each year in October by the four operators of the large power streets .	-3.6171
These include the additional costs incurred from the turn of energy , which they can collect by means of an electricity price .	-5.1633
Pfullendorf is the last link in this chain .	-2.2665
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company was even assumed in its forecasts of a higher level , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-4.4927
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-3.3695
" We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x , " said Bias , with the number more close to the 2 cents .	-3.2759
Take care of maintenance light on Duration	-4.3252
Sometimes a traffic light is not green .	-2.4431
The contact loop in the street does not respond , or the light sign is broken .	-2.3834
What do you do - go red ?	-3.7398
If a person has been waiting for long enough for a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-4.4591
However , the waiting time must be " appropriate " , which could be interpreted from case to case by case .	-4.2597
Becker advises to stop at least five minutes before the traffic starts to function .	-3.7078
Anyone who continues the journey despite red lights must be aware , however , that he is full of blame for an accident caused by it .	-4.3237
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and points to a decision by the Oberland Court Hamm .	-3.0654
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes and had to respond to a negligent red-light violation .	-3.2929
The traffic light was not broken , but rather later pushed around green .	-15.8073
A ban on driving remained spared him because of the particular situation - but not the fine .	-4.3337
Council looks forward to sound budgets	-2.7483
Whenever budgetary meetings are at stake , mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-3.2602
The municipality bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has already known the administration since 2005 .	-3.6932
The 2012 financial year , too , can be booked as a success in this sense .	-12.9863
This was clear when the annual accounts for 2012 .	-2.7493
As Andrea Rothmund pointed out , the administrative budget , with around EUR 7.6 million , was higher than planned for one million .	-13.8540
The surplus of the administrative budget is also about EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-2.4800
The surplus is primarily due to higher income tax revenues and the local share of the income tax .	-3.7922
The asset budget was also clear once again about the scheduled values .	-2.7370
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.3532
" This is essentially the higher introduction of the administrative budget , " says Rothmund .	-13.1282
Since fewer investments have been made than planned in the 2012 financial year , refund increases have also been higher .	-3.9738
Overall , the general reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-2.8652
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work .	-1.9806
" Such a work does not simply shake out of the sleeve , " Gerster praised with a view to the accounts .	-3.9267
He and the municipalities were obviously delighted with the good figures .	-11.3980
It may sound paradoxical , but precisely these good figures could soon cost citizens more .	-14.1609
The good financial situation has allowed the municipality to abandon high levels of leverage in the past earli . under the of , the of the uniunity until a feof 200of the events of the event of the of the	-25.2439
That , in turn , has been cut by the country , according to the Gerster grants often .	-5.1460
There are conditions for these grants from a number of compensatory deposits .	-3.8968
Among other things , cities and communities which request grants must show certain leverage rates .	-4.0722
" We must look at the issue of lifting rates because in the years to come investments that we would like to have grants ' , announced Gerster in this context .	-5.2630
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in Choir for 60 years	-1.6610
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the Male Sangverein Cäcilia is nearly twice as long as the autumn festival , in which he was solemnly honored .	-3.9670
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his men 's song on stage .	-2.8239

In the association , Wermter was also active , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-2.9111

Kenyan Press Impaired about Controverse Media Act	-2.9321
“ We are in a frightening situation and we must ask ourselves : what does Parliament think of abolishing tomorrow ’ s judicial independence ? ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft legislation to be unconstitutional .	-4.5940

According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu refers to a psychological phenomenon that feels that a new situation has already experienced or seen .	-4.0163
In the case of the visit to the Rhine-Waal University of Rhine-Waal , it does not have to stay at the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-4.5934
After all , the café with the beautiful name is exactly what it wants to do : to make a real stay not only thankful , but to make a repetitive experience .	-6.4059
Because it 's just fun and is just beautiful .	-3.1765

Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.6443

Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures	-14.0277
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the vigilant eyes of the Samora Machel statue , the state founder and the first president of Mozambique to vote for peace in a rare public demonstration .	-3.6786
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.0326
For fear of the country ’ s future , it has exchanged its business clothing against a T-shirt with the writing “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the amount on the independence place of the capital on Thursday .	-5.2390
For two weeks now , there have been almost daily reports on collapses between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.9196
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement that initially supported the Rhodesia governed by the White Rhodesia and later the South African government to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.1814
Following the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party ing ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!	-12.0861
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will fall back into a balanced conflict , but the recent events of foreign investors and locals have worried .	-3.1479
There is a lot at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could bring investments of more than $ 50 billion of companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anadarco to the US in the coming years .	-5.0496
The ruling Frelimo Party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo has been blaming each other for tensions .	-3.0802
Renamo claims that the government had provoked the recent mergers by attacking its members in the Sofala Province , a traditional Hochburg Renamos on 17 October .	-3.0685
The attacks on previous rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , Renamo ’ s speaker against the Financial Times .	-2.6955
The government is blaming Renamo for mergers and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-15.2756
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downgrade concerns about instability .	-1.4699
In relation to AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards itself as “ losers , ” who wants to use “ all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-13.6023
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasise that they want to avoid war .	-1.4280
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted , Renamo is giving up the 1992 peace agreement .	-11.4769
He explained to the FT so that he had meant that Frelimo does not respect the agreement .	-4.0844
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-2.1014
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fueled by a number of collapses this year . eveven though such measurmenmenmenmenundancimenmembements undersusuffer from subjects such as	-24.0189
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who merge the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , Docent at the Open University and Mozambique experts .	-3.0644
None of them is well negotiated and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.3786
Renamo , which pushes for electoral reforms , has already said that it will boycott municipal elections in November .	-2.6731
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.5402
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to make concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.5536
Renamo ’ s electoral success has shrinked since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Movimento Democrático de Moçambique ( MDM ) , will probably improve in the elections .	-3.3257
Mazanga claims that if his second term ends next year , Guebuza wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-17.2909
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” said Mazanga .	-2.6447
It is unclear what Renamo capacities have , but it has made unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link .	-3.7917
Most of the festivals took place in the province of Sofala , which is several hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal .	-5.1400
In June , Rio suspended for a month the use of the railways after Renamo announced an attack on the course .	-2.9494
Mazanga responded restraintly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-2.2483
Renamo wanted “ the international community to warn that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-1.8151
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping .	-3.8539
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he says .	-3.0288
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people just wanted stability .	-1.4112
“ No interests Renamo and Frelimo , they simply want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-2.8837
Children should receive myths and legends as “ models for life , ” says an author .	-2.6026
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force does not have a chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.8324
Many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of old works .	-3.2755
“ I find it wonderful that in America , myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-2.1528
I have been proposing this as a plan for 20 years .	-2.1882
He added , among authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” , children would “ switch off completely , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would “ underscore . ”	-4.1768
Crossley Holland , who has translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-4.0032
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author who writes for adults and an author who writes for children is necessary to convey hope .	-2.8680
Not everything must be simplified or lead to Happy End , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.3810
This must be underscored , revealed by history and not explained .	-2.9178
This is the old story of the show rather than narrative .	-2.5620

Their expectation then made the three-king-singer , who led Hansjacob to call : " Ach how beautiful , there are youth memories of my own triangle " .	-6.2944
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the children of storkholders with their loud " home , house " .	-11.1058
His criticism of the Official Church at that time was as much as his concerns about the expansion in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-4.2116
In the home erde , behind his tomb on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his retirement site .	-3.6186
" A tranquil spirit had finally found its peace and had gone for ever " , said at the end of the scene .	-4.0728

Court blocks the NYPD Stop and Frisk Directive	-2.0699
A Federal Appeal Court in the US blocked on Thursday the arrangement of a judge calling for changes to the Stop-and-Frisk Programme ( “ Continue and Search ” ) of the New York Police Department , and removed the judge from the case .	-4.4865
The 2nd US Appeal Court declared that the decisions of Judge Shira Scheindlin would be suspended until a city appeals .	-3.5557
The judge had judged in August that the city violates the constitution with the way in which the programme for the content and questions of persons would be implemented .	-4.2117
The city was appealing against its assessment and the remedies ordered , including the decision to establish a monitoring centre to support the police in amending their directive and the corresponding training programme .	-4.6559
The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for suspension on Tuesday .	-2.0720
The appeal report stated that the judge must be exempted from the case because it violated the Code of Conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of party ; this was partly justified by a number of media interviews and public statements in which it had publicly responded to the criticism of the Court .	-4.8596
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they were inappropriately targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk programme .	-3.0383

In 2004 , four men who belonged to all minorities submitted a complaint that became a collective action .	-4.0836
Advocates of changes to the NYPD Stop and Frisk Programme say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and more effective police force and influence the way other police presidents use the regulation .	-4.0945
Opponents believe that the changes would destroy the morale of the police , but not crime ; it would also waste money and do not solve the broader problem of a police that is under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of posts over the last decade .	-5.0450
The judge pointed out that they did not end the stop-and-frisk practice that was constitutional , but only reform the type of implementation of controls by the NYPD .	-3.6456

Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a supervised matte behind the gallery in the school turnhalle .	-4.2108
The investigation officials of the sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , which doubts the 17-year-old family .	-3.4764
“ You are convinced that your son was murdered , ” explained Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , against FoxNews.com.	-2.6216
They would never believe that he died as the sheriff concluded .	-2.4350
“ You believe that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics as well as the common sense of common sense , ” said Crump .	-4.2121

Is his death resulting in a crime ?	-1.9195

My goal is to find out the truth .	-1.3186
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.0542
Moore explained to reporters who initially autopsy indicated that Johnson died of the consequences of “ position-related figures . ”	-4.1063

CDC Publish Allergy Guidelines for Schools	-1.6978
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a number of guidelines for the use of food allergies in schools .	-2.6741
These are the first such directives that the US Government issued , since the number of children with food allergies increases .	-3.7940
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.8543
According to CDCs between 1997 and 2007 , food allergies have increased by 18 % .	-2.8099
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies at the teaching body and employees and how to handle children showing allergic reactions .	-4.1913
It is also recommended that schools Epinephrin have stock – the auto injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – to meet a potentially fatal oversensitivity response .	-4.1614
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that Epinephrin can keep schools easier .	-3.6273
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic response .	-2.2082

Parents of intersexual children can choose “ Gender Indetermined ”	-2.1547
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with non-clear genitals .	-2.3797
Newborn is no longer given rigid male or female assignments .	-2.5109
According to the new law , parents no longer need to explain gender for such children , but can specify “ indeterminate ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .	-3.9049
The objective of the law is to take the pressure from parents to avoid hasty decisions relating to newborn operations and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-4.5903
An intersexual person said , according to BBC years later , “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.1126
I remain the pattern created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .	-2.5489
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year comes neither as a boy nor as a girl .	-2.9509
They are among the intersexuals , a group falling under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation ” ( DSD ) , a collection concept for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( eggs or hodes ) or unusually developed genitals .	-3.7431
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.0685
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US are advising to use the best available information on gender allocation if a provision is not possible , rather than waiting for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before , if anything , choosing an operation .	-4.2142
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in the problems of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds to a good thing . ”	-3.1645
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.0778
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not apply , ” he said .	-2.5814
You can make a gender assignment without operation and then wait for identity to develop .	-3.3197
The scientific data about how a child even develops its gender identity is not very precise .	-2.7487
Nobody knows why it is happenin. ! !!! ! !!!!!!!!	-8.1578
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.9546
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinct from transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender-based , but due to their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them a report a report a report  .	-16.5255
These characteristics were shown in subsequent sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals , or chromosoms and hormones .	-4.2022
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination exposed to intersexual and transgender persons in professional life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .	-3.0857

Gender issues are still controversial in neighbouring France , so a message on France 24 .	-2.8311
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.0765
The US Catholic Online website has also opposed German law , with the explanatory statement : “ When the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we are two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-4.6696
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared to Baby Zone , it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth .	-3.8384
“ Parents ’ thoughts are already strict enough , especially if they do not know the sex of their own child , ” she said the parent website .	-4.4706
Children need stability and security .	-0.7014
Historically , children born with both male and female gender parts were described as hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .	-2.9688
Ten years ago , medicine viewed gender as something that can be extinguished and rebuilt .	-2.7887
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being doubted , after knowing how complex gender identity is , and doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels in growing up with the gender they assign .	-4.9058
“ In the mid-twentieth century , this was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-2.8277
If such a child was born , it was not called the psychiatrist , but the surgeons .	-2.7245
The prevailing theory of the treatment of children with unambiguous genitals goes back to Dr John Money from John Hopkins University , who believed that gender is formable .	-3.9192
He marked the term “ gender identity ” and argued , social and environmental impetus – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , and shaped whether a person considers themselves to be male or female .	-4.4686
But in a 1966 case known as John / Joan , his theories were controversial .	-2.6428
He addresses the parents of a boy whose penis was separated from a plugged circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his hods and then take him as girls .	-6.1768
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , but it was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.1602
When the boy was about 15 , he returned to male gender and married a woman .	-12.9654
With 38 , he committed suicide .	-2.3627
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.5899
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the Internet , survivors of these gender operations have entered the public , who are “ not happy with the result . ”	-3.4594
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana , born with XY-male chromosomes , but two clear genitals .	-2.7861
The doctors were not clear whether he had a great clitory or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as man .	-3.2533
So his external organ and hodes were surgically removed shortly after birth in 1976 , and he was granted as girls .	-4.0154
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.7156
“ I knew I ’ m not a girl , ” he said to ABCNews.com	-11.2263
I was unhappy , but it was really hard to ask questions .	-10.3525
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-2.0376
But , because he was depressive and knew that something was not true , he demanded his medical acts .	-2.5669
What he found out was shocking .	-0.9717
I was sterilized in my birth – and no one ever said so .	-2.7871
Bruce was born with a DSD where his body could not produce enough testosteron to develop genitals .	-2.6121
After learning the truth , he returned to male identity , Testosteron injections received and removed his breasts .	-3.7590
He became infertile by the operation .	-2.4254
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-2.4983
But Anne Tamar Mattis , CEO of the legal group Advocates for Informed Choice based in California , ensures that German law could “ stamp and stigmatize . ”	-3.5177
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make rapid decisions and introduce the child to “ assign ” , she explained .	-3.9283
We fear that benefits intervention .	-2.1071
We think it would be better to assign and wait for male or female gender .	-2.2046
But we do not know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.1431
Tamar Mattis said that their organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognise as the third gender . ”	-2.9489
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their gender , ” she explained .	-14.8920
The German law is about allocating birth .	-2.3439
This is not a struggle to force small children at this time .	-2.5001
When they are adult , they can decide for themselves on their b.	-11.7984
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a brustradiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law “ authorized ” both parents and children .	-3.9261
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance .	-2.5316
Katie developed female characteristics due to the receptor defect of the Testosteron target cells .	-3.1776
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-2.3514
Today , Katie 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as employee in the child psychiatrist .	-11.9788
While it is infertile , it is hopeful to have a child through adoption or surrogate mothers .	-3.2991
“ The law gives parents room , which does not have to make decisions overthrown , ” said Baratz .	-3.4847
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them time before writing them “ male ” or “ female . ”	-3.2725
In this way , everything is fine – one draws the child large and loves it .	-3.5151
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent ’ s happiness .	-2.2874
And it is not necessary to make an operation that can no longer be undone .	-3.4047
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents reverse because they believe they do not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-3.7605
Ultimately , the child decides on the gender that fits better – and that is wonderful .	-3.0691
This enables children to take the decision itself .	-1.9913
Unknown girls violate Car Shot	-2.8444
Unknown have injured a twelve year-old Saxony-Anhalt on shoots from a car .	-4.5193
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon .	-2.5020
That was what the police did in Castle .	-3.5963
The girl was easily injured on the left wade .	-1.4649
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital .	-2.5530
The shot came from a small car that had passed on a group of six children and suddenly stopped in .	-14.6050
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-2.0677
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .	-1.4971
A disc broke .	-1.9913
They then took it .	-2.3522
The criminal police identified it on Friday .	-1.2613
Until now , the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-2.9518
Officials were merely called two times to acquire children who thrown them against house facades .	-3.9347
Since homeowners recognized this in good time and the eggs removed the eggs immediately , no damage should be done .	-18.4130
Furthermore , some sylvester böllers were probably ignored in the urban area , but no damage has occurred .	-19.6542
A resident in the Bishop Friendorfer path reported that his car was involved with cloppaper and his cycling blends were removed .	-5.2702

Actually , Waltraud Ries lives dreamy .	-2.8523
Their house is situated in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , ancient trees , nice neighbours and not too much transport .	-4.0585
It is only a few minutes away from public transport .	-11.4066
" You hopefully have no fear of spinning ? " , Waltraud Ries asks and shows a fat spinner in the door frame .	-3.7839
I 've been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-8.0563
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.3983
The reason is not spinning phobia , however , but the concern to be unable to overcome the many stairs to the house and in the apartment again declares it .	-5.5568
Moreover , since a meniscus operation , the Middle East has experienced its own body , which means moving with handicap from floor to floor .	-4.2246
Recently , a book from her was published on the subject of happiness living in the age - what form is the best for me ? ' .	-5.0535
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going at all age ' , begins to tell it .	-3.8095
When she moved to the maisonet apartment more than 20 years ago , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green  .	-10.6412
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries differs .	-2.4584
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the issue of ' housing in age ' .	-3.5970
Most people squeeze as long as they are .	-3.5440
Old will always be the other , saying it smiling .	-11.4101
Only when suffering pressure is really big will we think .	-3.5514
'Then it may be too late ' , so giant .	-2.2864
In her book , the inner architect presents 17 models for a self-determined living in the age .	-3.4129
" What form you choose is always an individual decision , " she explains .	-2.8479
D i e Solution there is not for age .	-1.7740
Even those who can afford the retirement seat in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he can also become sick .	-4.3158
And : ' Without good knowledge of the national language , you also join the Dolce Vita , ' gives the specialist book author wants to consider settlements .	-5.7551
Among its models , classic care models , alternative forms of residence or the often cited Pensioners WG can be found .	-4.0090
Everyone has their ticks and macks in their age	-3.8433
'For me , however , such a community would be nothing ' , she means with an eye angle .	-4.0635
Even not as in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-3.0763
'At age you simply need his withdrawal rooms , ' Ries .	-4.8673
Nevertheless , the book author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior communcommunity  is able to work   .       a un una  un	-16.3257
But then this must be different from the classic Studenten-WG .	-3.2220
And sometimes you just want his peace ' , believe her .	-3.8812
With this view , it is not alone in the capital , at least .	-9.9347
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment ' , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of citizens ' service life at the age of the national capital .	-4.0347
Their services advise people around the theme of ' age ' .	-10.4935
Therefore , elderly people would often accept inconveniences and restrictions , only in order to remain in their usual environment , that is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-4.9239
Today there are many ways of making the house or the apartment accessible free of ch.	-14.6470
Ries recommends all those who deal with the age-right-wing rebuilding of their house or apartment to inform themselves thoroughly and not to apply for the best craftsmen .	-5.7097
Today there are also specialists for age-right renovation .	-13.1252
Even in the rental apartment you can realize one or two , and if it is only the increase in the toilet , the interior design clarifies .	-5.6517
But it is not always possible to reorganise the existing apartment in an accessible manner , even if it is so beautiful .	-4.4868
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-2.0237
Although you could install a stairlift within the apartment , the path with stairs paved to the door would be far greater obstacles .	-4.8023
She will continue until she has found the ideal object for her and her husband .	-2.1483
Before moving , it grey more than before the spider at home .	-4.2248
US Wants to Criminal Snowden	-2.8509
The US has not changed its position on former US intelligence staff Edward Snowden .	-2.4335
It is still accused of having provided unauthorised secret information .	-14.4217
He therefore needs to face a criminal proceeding in the US , said the spokesperson of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-3.7144
Snowden 's latest statements would not be changed .	-3.2801
Previously , German green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , called on the US not to threaten him with punishment .	-3.4533
Psaki emphasised that there are statements made by a Member of Parliament , not by a German government .	-4.4185
Edward Snowden is basically ready to discuss with German authorities .	-16.6831
But first he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.1992
This has made it clear to the US former NSA employees in a non-addressed letter that the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden , and forwarded to Federal Government , Bundestag and General Federal Prosecutor	-10.6458
The letter has the following wording after a translation commonly used by cruises : letters of crules leave letleletter :	-17.5072

As a result of my employment in these institutions , I became witnesses of systematic breaches of my government , which led me to act morally .	-3.5064
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw a serious and continuing hetting that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-3.5972
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum that gives me the Russian Federation according to international law .	-2.5621
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-1.8685
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged revelations on a system of all-embracing surveillance that no one is accountable as a service to the public .	-3.4222
These spyonage revelations have brought forward many proposals concerning new laws and directives aimed at the former hidden abuse of public trust .	-4.0215
The benefit for society from these findings is becoming increasingly clearer , while at the same time the risks involved were significantly reduced .	-4.0648
Although the result of my efforts was proven positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a faithful break and seeks to criminalise and charge political expression .	-3.9039
Nevertheless , the truth is not a crime .	-1.6637
I am confident that , with the support of the international community , the United States Government will take this detrimental stance .	-13.9011
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate in the responsible education of the matters concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports , in a reasoning and leimal fasI hopmind mine .	-24.5367

According to Jonathan Martin , the national political correspondent of the Times , the book focuses thoroughly on the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House to measure , especially the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , what effect it has on surveys to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President .	-4.7343
The potential change was a rigorous secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.7930
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , former leader of Obama , Jim Messina , and the former leading adviser of the White House , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the change that was thought .	-4.0815
In Double Down , Daley was at the top of the effort to exchange bids despite their “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before deciding against such a move after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would not improve Obama ’ s opportunities .	-5.2199
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing bids with Clinton .	-1.9813
“ I expressed a whole series of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” said Daley to the magazine .	-3.0522
It must be remembered that the President had terrible surveys at the time , so we thought , “ For God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-3.7811
While Daley called the “ offered care , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that during the re-election campaign , a significant effort was made to find out if such a train pays off the ballot box .	-4.5635
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you do not think seriously , ” Martin said at AC360 .	-3.5484
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange .	-2.1656
Martin said to CNN , he asked Daley whether his boss had known about the potential change .	-15.6905
While Daley said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff said that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew of it .	-3.6650
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s desk would have reached Obama ’ s political sonditure .	-3.6506
Cooper asked Martin if he thinks seriously that Obama did not know whether to leave bids in the elections .	-3.0552
“ Possible ” , Martin replied .	-1.9655
What happens on the way with my email ?	-1.8943
E-mail is actually called electronic letter .	-2.1834
Has the Internet service implemented the letter secret when designing the Internet service ?	-4.4495
The priority was to make communication possible when designing early Internet services .	-2.7978
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been taken into account in creating a stable foundation for a safe letter chexchanchanchaning . everyin , undersupport susuch undeununderunding	-21.8877
Therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds more to an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.2403
If user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " , are the computers of the two directly connected ?	-2.9424
The e-mail program or browser from Anna sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step .	-14.6149
For example , if it has a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.6286
This mail server sends content to the provider using Benni .	-1.9648
On the route the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet .	-2.8243
Bennie can then call the content from his provider .	-2.4128
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the network ?	-2.0640
Most mails are read several times by software robots .	-1.5749
The sender 's provider usually verifies whether the mail contains an annex .	-4.3750
A virus check is also made on receiver systems .	-2.0143
In addition , the providers check whether this is an annoying and undesirable spam mail that is equally deleted or at least away into a spam folder .	-5.6389
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.5226
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.7348
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their next holiday trip , Google can hide links to vacation options .	-4.7479
Read also unknown people the emails ?	-2.3141
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail is very low .	-2.9587
In theory , this is possible .	-2.2812
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to collect electronic post .	-2.7856
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to stop or take note of emails .	-3.8307
In addition , there are possible illegal speaking actions .	-3.6754

Mother in the Forest Cassing Pensions	-11.8369
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-1.7588
He grouped deaths in a forest - and continued to cash their pensions and care money .	-3.9567
In order to be able to cash pensions and care money , a 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his de moto after a police inat the forat .	-21.6104
First he covered the death of the 89 years , then he had deleted the money for more than a year and a half .	-4.1077
The 67-year-old must now take responsibility for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-2.7222
So the man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.1491
The man was suspected already in May : at that time , medicines were no longer needed for careful mothers .	-4.5036
The investigator told the pensioner that his mother traveled to Spain .	-2.1064
Because the officials were strange about this , they continued .	-3.8219
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and he had last maintained it .	-16.7398

Are you looking for ice-cream lighting in the darkness ?	-3.2489
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the dark – through sources .	-3.2802
Charlie Francis made use of the fluorescent characteristics of sea animals and created a bright delicacy .	-4.3220
The idea of this came to him after reading research about sources and convincing Chinese scientists to produce bright protein artificially .	-5.2612
Ice cream responds with the tongue , increasing the pH value in the protein and triggering lights .	-16.6394
Chris explains that dining reacts to the heat in the mouth – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-3.7136
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and that is how one gets two grams of them for 200 pounds . ”   a a !li!!!!!!!!!!!!	-13.7666
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue with a neutral pH value .	-2.5641
When the mouth heats the protein , the pH value and ice are shining .	-3.2632
We have tested it over the past few months and it seemed ideal to get it to Halloween because it has this wonderful lightweight effect .	-3.3468
It is probably the most expensive ice-cream I have ever manufactured , because the sound light is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.1390
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-2.0477
However , it tastes delicious .	-8.5614
Charlies experimental company located in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-3.2132
But its latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-1.8143
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.0504
This is impossible in itself because of the light break caused by the ice cream consisting of ice cream , but I suspect we find a way to make it .	-4.4297
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a source produced by Chinese scientists artificially	-14.5146
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League after six days .	-12.7823
Now it comes for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-3.6869
With this game the season begins for us .	-2.1877
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " Ehler 's behavior is optimistic .	-2.9798
He has finally made available his complete cadre with the exception of the permanent Hendrik blohme .	-4.4247
Daverden , too , relies on tempo .	-3.7172
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.5581
First of all , however , we must increase the coverage , which has left anything but a safe impression .	-4.6808
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed after the first season victory against North Horn .	-3.1721
The game was of course a house number .	-1.5087
But for that reason we are not the favorite , because everything can happen in the derby .	-4.0155
However , panitz now wants to look up in Morsum to start a series .	-3.0364

Halloween 2013 : In numbers	-1.0776
When I was small , Halloween had something magic .	-1.5591
My sister and I was allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress us for the neighbourhood .	-2.5810
Today I have become a Halloween muffel .	-2.5921
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute from my apartment of sweets , and I do not think it will do so this year .	-4.7531
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep about Halloween .	-2.2665
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be accurate – celebrate Halloween this year , spending $ 6.9 billion on candy , costumes , and decorations , including the US Retailer Association ( NRF ) .	-3.6014
One thing that I look forward to every Halloween again is the trend values .	-3.0168
Costums will represent about $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , such as NRF .	-3.4218
This year , inviting items are the last cry .	-3.4786
Women no longer have to waste into sexy clothing , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburger or carottes .	-14.0598
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-3.6533
According to Google , the most sought costumes Zombies , Batman , Pirates and witches are .	-2.8939
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.8571
We dressed our dogs last year and were not alone to my amazement .	-3.7284
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , such as NRF .	-9.9908
These are a lot of “ hot dogs . ”	-2.0761
With regard to sweets , we are not quite painful .	-3.7786
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , The Nielsen Company .	-1.5671
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocories , lutschers , bonbons and rubber bears .	-2.7307
So good news for the US Trade Department of 41 million people dragging through the quarter with the saying ‘ sweetness or saures ’ .	-12.5864
Indeed , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and , let us not imagine , eat .	-3.7847
The only thing we do not wish to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn , yet 15 million kilograms are sold by Halloween , such as the National Association of Foot Manufacturers .	-3.7083
These are about nine billion maize grains .	-2.1009
It is a mystery that I could not solve yet .	-2.2713
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it spucts .	-2.9340
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is in fact a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.1215
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States , which achieve $ 500 million of revenue , America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photographs on which you can pink into the trousers and then place friends on Facebook , where you will not get them back , and then leave a comment like “ nice face expression . ”	-6.9043
But let us finally come to the pillows .	-2.7389
Charlie Brown familiar us with the Great Kurbi when we were children , and the cutting of a cubic lantern is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something that we made from small ones .	-4.6158
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend began only last year thanks to pinterest , so most of us have grown up in sitting on the cube and not sitting in it .	-4.7614
This year , Americans will spend approximately $ 106 million on cutbacks , the US Census Bureau .	-2.9911
The cubic lanterns , which slowly scrapped in the front garden , probably come from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of cupboards were harvested this year .	-5.1827

Rescue forces have found a coaled box in a three-family house on a fire in helmbrechts . resres!	-15.5018
Whether it was a resident that was still unclear , as a spokesman of the police said in Bayreuth .	-3.2698
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor .	-2.4102
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames began from a window .	-3.4378
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-3.5281
This and another room burned out entirely .	-2.8895
The entire ground floor has been damaged .	-1.3544
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police spokesperson continued to explain .	-2.9454
The building is no longer inhabitable .	-2.7011
The exact cause of fire was not clear .	-2.4032
Germany ’ s largest national church has launched an offensive start to advertise the profession of the pastor .	-3.0061
The Evangelic-Lutheran Church of Hanover expects the number of pastors currently 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 .	-4.1513
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelic Press Service .	-3.7562
It is attractive to determine the working and day flow itself .	-2.6060
With Burfien , the Church of the National Church first appointed a pastor in a full place to enthuse young people for theology studies .	-4.7915
Currently , fewer and less young people choose to study theology .	-2.5001
Burfien returns to the process of decision-making : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.8718
The profession of great freedom and diversity is characterised by this .	-3.0922
I am Mr my calendar of appointments and I can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.1453
Pastors could be very close to the people as a seafarer .	-11.5140
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well .	-1.6542
To be sure , more will be paid in the free economy , but theologists would have a safe employer .	-2.7914
This comes down to the young people of today who are not just about careers , but about meaningful work .	-3.8512
According to the National Church , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , some 60 pastors are currently going to retirement per year .	-3.8154
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariat .	-2.6541
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resins , Emsland or the Wendland , it is difficult to fill posts in future .	-4.7187
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people , inviting prominents who have studied theology .	-12.8652
Theology studies offer a wide range of training . ! ! !! !! !! ! ! ! !!!!!!!! !!!	-14.7315

The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with support from bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-4.2472
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , said : “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.8316
They are not all experienced race drivers , but people who are looking for tension and adventures as well as for a way to world class events .	-3.7840
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new possibilities to experience the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare newcomers for the straps and reality of Rally Raid .	-4.0844
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship .	-2.7749

Fire brigades called to save a hundred meters above the ground on a dangerous rock lead in a stone fraction	-18.2951
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby followed a smaller traffic accident	-2.8073
Three days later it was discovered by a walker in the stone break in her abusive situation	-15.1353
Fire fire fighters saved to rock wall and saved the dog before safe death	-4.2023
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing a chicken into safety , which was fixed on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall .	-4.8175
The nine months old cockerspaniel hündin Ruby followed a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before it was saved from a stone break on Wednesday .	-3.8454
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 , whom the dog belongs , came to the stone flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service firefigh   .	-13.1882
They had desperately looked for their missing husbands and published assistance in social networks when they had disappeared after the small traffic accident .	-5.0259
Approximately 14 : 15 on Wednesday a walker who carried out his dog , the stranded ruby on the 15 metre high paragraph in the stone break .	-4.8053
The technical bailout team of the Cleckheaton Fire Station helped to save Ruby , which was then transported upwards in a dog box .	-4.4095
Andy Clayton , the specialist of the technical bailout team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.9318
It was situated in the center of the rock wall – 15 meters from above and the ground .	-11.2418
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was as stifrozen .	-2.6316
But now it is good .	-2.0710
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.1099
That was quite unusual .	-1.8746
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-12.0288
Peter Lau , the specialist of the technical bailout team , said , “ Ruby had a huge happiness . ”	-2.4834
It was possible that it was very difficult to injure or worse .	-2.3858
Ruby was brought to the veterinary investigation , but did not discover anything but exhaustion and dehydration .	-3.9301
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said , “ When saving was scared . ”	-3.4481
I could not believe that she was really up there .	-10.5024
It was wonderful to keep them back into the poor .	-1.5818
The veterinary declared that the exhaustion had become too large and collapsed would probably have crashed .	-16.5553
The fire fighters have done great things .	-2.6619
It was really brave what they did .	-1.0606
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-3.1369

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the Election	-1.4557
A new day , a new horror story for independence .	-2.0108
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.1340
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured along the Hadrian Wall .	-2.9063
Indeed , the Strathclyde template referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe , but that was – expected – no role in the headlines .	-4.2506
Nor did anyone mention that EU member states often undertake their strict rules if it is more favourable to them .	-3.6934
Since Scotland is not currently a member of the Schengen area , the continued failure to respect Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Scots .	-4.2628
So no story .	-2.0309
And one who has already come in the years that she is already a fossil : for the first time I have heard the “ independence means passport controls ” -ente belonging to at least 40 years ago .	-5.4137
This is an interesting point in the constant repeat of this ancient history .	-3.0509
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance it after the European arrow ?	-2.0368
Why exchange the London Yoch against Brussels , especially now ?	-2.5029
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan to unify Europe has stalled .	-3.4468
The euro crisis has officially died Europe .	-2.3518
Throughout the EU , political parties gain ground that are anti-EU or wish to board the euro as a common currency .	-4.2115
Even in Germany , the Eurosceptic Party could drive alternative to Germany – only this year – just under five million votes in the Federal Day election in September , effectively distributing Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-11.5346
There have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.4480
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.7358
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket , which requires the respective national economy to keep the common currency , many people believe that the Europe project has gone too far .	-4.0693
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-2.0078
Instead , the Eurosystem has laid down its members at exchange rates that are beneficial for German exporters – and German politicians want to do so .	-3.4281
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage to Germany .	-3.3330
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin .	-1.9976
A profound European productivity problem is behind the current burden and monetary problems .	-2.9293
As a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays the double for electricity and the four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.6826
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-1.9259
All world wage fixes do not protect European petrochemical industry from pushing cheap American shale gas into the corner .	-2.9812
As a result , a revolt emerges , especially in France , the former EU cheerleader .	-2.0722
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be held in check and raised Paris on the eye with Washington .	-3.4732
But Berlin does not need more than a gateway to political legitimacy , and has impressed Europe ’ s own economic policy , which is to fight the attacked French economy .	-4.7281
The result is that Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU National Front has just gained a crucial election and thus referred to three of the ruling socialists .	-17.4820
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-3.5601
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French working class ?	-2.8109
It wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.4547
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.6331
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.1287
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” that General de Gaulle favoured .	-12.2521
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.5161
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering in the US .	-3.6209
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone will be in Atlantic rain .	-2.3637
Where is Scotland left with all this ?	-2.1490
We can decide to be a region of ( in the last consequence ) small England .	-2.2812
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including , including , Berlin and Brussels , what they can say where they are !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-13.5651
I suspect that Scotland could drive well in a looser European composition if we retain our own currency .	-3.5611
Cooperation with other countries similarly thinking is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.6850
Otherwise , we should consider maintaining our economic independence in Norway .	-3.0153
The SNP government in Scotland is , remarkably , the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and in 2011 has gained a spectacular majority because of the rejection of the proposed ( and carried out ) cuts that Labour Secretary Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib dem coalition had to respond .	-4.6580
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now , only to impose austerity on Berlin and Brussels .	-2.9543

“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that puberty occurs quickly , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-3.5622
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame- and axle hair and body smell , are shown earlier in girls .	-4.3616
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of the manarche ( occurrence of the first rule blood ) over the last 40 years .	-13.3262
The average age age in the United States is 12.5 years , less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.2304
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years until the menarchy , ” Kaplowitz said , also author of the book “ Early Puberty in Girls : The essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-4.5786
Time is the most precise test of how the puberty moves forward .	-2.2782
It is controversial , which is actually the beginning of puberty , but “ early ” is needed when the breast increase is accompanied by a boost of growth before an age of eight years ago .	-4.5113
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a child ’ s doctor can closely monitor .	-2.4043
When advancing faster , tests may be displayed by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumore or cysts can be excluded .	-3.9125
There are treatments to delay an early menstruation and the defense of another consequence : the premature ageing of bones , which can lead to the ultimate impetus of growth and thus small body growth at adat .	-17.0451
The recommendations for medicine or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of child , development speed , growth rate and emotional maturity .	-3.0160
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-0.9250
Kaplowitz is restrained about medicines , but he acknowledges : “ Oppressing puberty can mitigate problems of behavior and the feelings of girls , unlike their age sensors . ”	-4.8039
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-2.0834
“ They worry about the pregnancy risk or how they handle the hygienic side , ” Kaplowitz said .	-3.1916
“ It was a shock , ” a woman remembers whose daughter received her ten days .	-3.2538
Although there were first signs and we spoke about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-2.8007
She came frightened and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friendship .	-2.7570
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.9827
But there is no coherent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be damaging .	-3.5410
Boys come similar to girls earlier in puberty .	-2.3834
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.6155
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls at the age of six to nine years , which produces a link between body fat and entry to puberty .	-3.8347
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have played a role .	-2.2459
In this country , African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white pensioners .	-2.6359
There are different explanations for this .	-1.5970
Globally , an early puberty of all possible things seems to be affected , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .	-2.4165
Another puzzle : although young people are growing face and shame hair earlier , the trend towards a fully previous puberty is not as much as girls .	-5.1356
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-1.7183
The appearance of acne and shameful is spread even among babies and children .	-3.7684
“ We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children ’ s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-10.7322
Parents should not hesitate to be consulted about their child , as they should speak with their child .	-3.1269
“ That may mean that one must talk earlier than expected , ” Kaplowitz riets .	-4.0606
If you stay calm , the child usually responds well .	-2.5883
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs previously .	-3.5496
Jumbo manufacturers argue in the face of large orders about seat width	-2.8255
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class for long-haul flights , which indicates the tone for a bitter collapse of the Dubai Airshow this month .	-12.2726
The dispute revolves around the width offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who try to most , but this referred space is the key to the efficiency assertions at the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . . lelelelele!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-17.0504
This week Airbus called for an industry standard , which prescribes a width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-4.1496
At a time when aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul flights and expect record contracts from November 17th to 21st .	-4.1653
As the lower part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results that the new “ mini jumbo ” design should provide .	-4.4662
Boeing claims that his modernised “ 777X ” captured 406 people at seats in the tourist class , which are more than 17 inches and allows ten per series .	-5.0359
Airbus declares that the competitive version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per series par.	-14.9157
Aircraft gigants often share hints about technical details through advertising in the technical press . particas!!	-11.7343
Now Airbus appeals before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X will probably make the race more than 100 orders , directly to the public .	-2.8847
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new war of advertising , and donors showed a picture where three people sit in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-4.3243
“ Boeing proposes long-distance flights in seats that are closer than regional Turbo props , ” says Airbus Chief John Leahy .	-3.1087
Given changed food habits , people are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-2.5579
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul trips , and the end of the century has increased the weight of the male average Americans between 40 and 49 years , such as the US Department of Health .	-3.8519
The tail range of the male average Americans in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics .	-3.0302
Airbus says that his rival stays at a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body range of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-13.8587
Airbus carried out investigations showing that an additional customs ( 2,54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 percent .	-20.0178
Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus to seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers how airlines make the balance between tariffs and facilities .	-4.0409
The company also explains , according to investigations , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat .	-3.4892
“ It really goes beyond giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe to be successful , ” explains Kent Craver von Boeing ’ s aircraft expert .	-3.8541
They do not want us to dictate what makes them profitable . every!	-9.7642
They know their business better than any other .	-1.4874
Passengers are talking about greater freedom of misery , but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-4.3363
A race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a sustainable impact on US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-15.2958
As Reuters reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the debate around the new jets .	-2.8477
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.1024
The statements by Boeings to the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-3.5828
Increased costs per unit are still lower than in ten seats currently used .	-2.8226
“ Boeing quets more seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-2.9140
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per series of existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-4.1223
“ Eighteen customs seating width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin installation , founder and publisher of Runway Girl Networ   .             a      a	-12.9392
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .	-2.6651
Global travelling jet sellers even contribute to measuring the installation at competition .	-4.1171
Even if they price the comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compressed furnishings for cheap airlines and regional flights .	-3.7143
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seated rows , but has not yet sold anything according to its own statement .	-4.8106
Until recently , Airbus emphasised the importance of more adaptability of cabins and offered broad seats to the corners for some jets .	-3.8334
Without the support of the single other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard will probably be buffed , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-12.6660
New Anti-Nikotin vaccines could make the guard fun for smoking .	-3.0147
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil fun in smoking .	-2.3173
A single dose of vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a life .	-2.3657
Further attempts are needed before human testing , which may take a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal said from the Weil Cornell Medical College in New York that the first results are good .	-3.9060
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying and trying all methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell .	-3.8951
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed in such a way that it contains genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.0919
The virus infects the liver cells selectively , which then produce a permanent flow of antibodies .	-2.5155
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving a smoker no high .	-3.5460
In attempts , vaccinated mice , which Nikotin was administered , retained its normal level of activity .	-3.2649
Mousing without vaccination would have taken a “ time , ” the researchers said , a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain .	-3.8010
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine .	-1.6989
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.4952
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were costly and impractical .	-2.7532
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably lower , because it turns liver cells into anti-body factories .	-2.3924
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered for people , if he is quite sure , before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-3.5866
But it is more likely that smokers would use him to stop .	-1.8515
“ You know , if they start to smoke again , they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them put the habit out ” , he explains .	-14.1111
British scientists said that the results are interesting , but at the same time warned that further research is needed .	-2.1746
Tripodi Disputes to be influenced by Obeid	-2.0910
Against the former minister of the Laboratory Party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales , an investigation is being introduced by government supervision .	-3.9992
The former NSW minister denies having changed the rules on maritime contempt on request of his political mentor Eddie Obid , which had hidden participation in three lands on state-controlled countries .	-4.5330
The Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations on Friday whether Obid has influenced various Ministers of State to extend legal contracts at the Circular Quay , where the objects operate two restaurants and a café without extending their expiry in August 2005 .	-4.9451
Now it is being identified because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the plots after Tripodi ’ s former Deputy Chairman Lynne Ashpole said on Thursday .	-6.0721
In many years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the Pacht Treaties .	-3.4734
The guardians were against them and wanted longer runtime .	-3.8516
In 2009 , the pacht agreements for companies at the Circular Quay , which brought $ 2.5 million annually without extending public tenders .	-4.3815
Tripodi , who was Harbour Minister from February 2006 until November 2009 , had originally spoken in favour of public tenderiI .	-13.3351
But he disputes having made the changes to Obid requests , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganisation of the government ’ s legal regulations .	-4.7211
One of the ICAC ’ s telephony writings showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who was changing the port ministry after working under Oboth the Fisheries Authority .	-4.5232
“ Was the issue discussed in these phone calls the preparation of commercial contempt arrangements ? ” , the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-3.6496
" No " , answered Tripodi .	-1.8442
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-1.7569
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-1.1873
Israeli fighting aircraft attack Syria ’ s official sources	-2.0539
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia , a senior government official confirmed Fox News .	-3.2502
The officials did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one thing .	-15.0874
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.7036
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria .	-2.7541
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to “ real-time ”	-2.3705
The government is thinking of enlarged measures on a “ real-time test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-3.4275
If the test is introduced , it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for the train of family and friends to Australia .	-3.7541
Today , a government proposal for discussion has been published after the former members of the Labor Party , Maxine McKew , condemned the government 's comments on foreign workers because they could be considered an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-4.6987
“ Volume declarations such as that foreigners should hire behind ‘ and , Australians first ‘ are a very unpleasant return in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she said to the Australia Institute today .	-4.9189
Historically , white workers should be protected – and if some in the region took an echo of this historical artifact , that would not surprise me .	-15.5359
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former Minister of Immigration , Chris Bowen .	-3.5792
Immigration Secretary Brendan O 'Connor , who joined talks about human smuggling in Sri Lanka yesterday , has implemented five of the recommended changes that others are still considered .	-3.7834
If the “ criterion of authenticity ” is accepted , someone who requests a visa could be reviewed as to whether “ the request is real in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-4.3705
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders , after companies that wanted to support only a small number of workers finally ended hundreds in the past .	-4.3775
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri-Lankan asylum was probably on a heart infarct after arriving this week with a boat of refugees on the Christmas island .	-3.5175
The nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia since his father was maintained by an adult cousin on Wednesday , who was also on the boat .	-4.3605
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .	-1.6663
The British Government announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.4128
The work of HS2 Ltd is proposed to implement high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England already at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.6209
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-1.7203
The Scottish Minister for Transport , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.6848
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train link between London and the West Midlands .	-1.8248
After Phase 2 , connections to Manchester and Leeds will be completed .	-2.7576
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of constructing the high-speed road between London and Nordengland of 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 bilpon .	-21.2413
The British Government , which is in discussions with transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further capacities and travel time improvements for Northern Scotland and Scotland .	-4.2708
This includes the possibility of a travel time of ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-2.8097
Baroness Kramer said , “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.7741
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.0772
Without it , we are facing a capacity crisis in our rail network .	-2.3431
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.5583
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is a good news for Scotland . ”	-1.8189
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” for Scottish involvement in the HS2 network .	-2.9095
Brown said , “ The high-speed rail link brings the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland , while at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power provides an argument for rapid rail links across the UK . ”	-4.3303
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner to the British Government and investigate the options for a high-speed train link in Scotland , creating the benefits for everyone and complementing the Glasgow Edinburgh connection that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-4.5013
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and to jointly adopting the next steps .	-3.1898
Regulations on electronic aircraft remain in force in Australia .	-2.3339
Australian passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at start and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax such devices .	-3.6173
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read , see , or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases if they are in “ flight mode ” .	-14.3398
During the majority of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-3.9825
Australian societies watch the decision to implement US airlines to do vast amounts of work , but do not pursue immediate plans to amend their rules .	-3.6534
The CASA Aviation Safety Authority also stated that the announcement will be viewed , but emphasised that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply in critical flight phases in Australia .	-4.6467
“ The CASA did not currently have any specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft , ” it was said .	-3.8717
The issue is subject to provisions that airlines must maintain safety at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin staff .	-3.9858
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and explains that they are open to change , but they should be initiated by the legislator .	-3.7838
“ We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic devices by the CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” a spokesman said .	-3.9062
Qantas explained that we will continue to stick to the current rules .	-3.2669
“ Our current directives provide that electronic equipment should not be used when starting and landing , and we have no plans to change that at the moment , ” the company declared .	-3.8288
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.6179
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers , and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind this .	-10.8543
The decision differs depending on the age of the fleet in US societies .	-3.1861
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders through mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer study .	-3.2295
“ After a airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can passengers allow the use of portable , lighter electronic devices such as tablets , e-book reading devices , and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-4.8916
In rare cases in bad view , crew will refer to passengers while landing turns off the devices .	-3.7989
The group also recommended that heavier devices start and landing safely below the seat or subjects over the seats .	-4.5522
Before the revierderby against switches had provided the most inherent BVB supporters with luminous fluids for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-6.3453
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences .	-1.5900
Before the Friday game of the football federal liga against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras responded with a silence - initbegi  a a a !	-12.5967
It was an unusual acoustic acoustics that offered the viewer until shortly before the federal liga play between the German Vicemaster Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park .	-4.9278
The guest fans were mostly listened to their songs .	-3.6411
The southern tribunal , on the other hand , presented itself first extraordinarily quiet : no sings , no battlegrounds .	-5.2097
The podium of the capo , which otherwise coordinates shared fire , remained unoccupied .	-2.9495
And quite the front of the gallery , together , a great flag wandered " section stadium ban " .	-5.2895
Just as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player , branded up short-term jubl! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-12.3154
When his team colleagues followed , there were loud vocals and hurricanes - but not long everywhere .	-3.8678
Nothing raised in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery .	-2.9596
Also , stadium speaker Norbert Dickel listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , contract extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration .	-4.5598
Only five minutes before the first appearance , the Capo declared his podest - and the tension , which until then hands with hands , was exposed in a loud shrine , when thickness as usual asked the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-8.4518
The last thing , as always , was the South Tribune on the row - and finally it was here as usual the loudest place in the stadium .	-5.2711
And , at the latest than with the Anpfiff of the South Tribune , the loud call " derbysieger stands on " came , everything was like ever .	-6.4581
The silence before has probably been a response to the events of recent days .	-2.5241
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the most involved BVB supporters had fired luminous materials into spectators and placed them on the square - almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller met .	-6.3385
The game was played late because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.4782
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the leaders of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believe Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable date for the fan representatives .	-4.7266
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB boss announced on a podium discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening .	-2.8792
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited Ultras a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-2.4083
'I have banned ' , he explained .	-2.2150
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnology .	-1.9933
Moreover , Ultras were shown various possibilities for punishment - until Tuesday , they now have time to choose one .	-4.4319
Otherwise , Watzke , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of the next week .	-2.6578
" This becomes crucial " , insured watts .	-3.1166
You can be wonderful how the responses in the southern gallery will be .	-4.6501
Pfandhouses booming in Singapore , as the middle class crisis has arrived	-2.2186
In a pandhouse in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Jani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden army , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school charges of their daughters .	-3.8834
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is my whole money there , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.0825
Although they earn 3,000 dollars of Singapore every month ( approximately EUR 1,730 ) as administrator and their husband also work , they do not explain monthly family income .	-4.2072
Indeed , demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt increases – is so great that ValueMax , where she exchanged her , became the third house listed on the Singapore exchange this week .	-4.1918
Jewish pledges are not only a fast way to get money – $ 1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as an unsecured bank loan .	-4.0717
Typically , Pfandhäuser in Singapore demands an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , just over the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-3.6951
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that this does not require a review of credit worthiness or evidence of income , which is why loans are faster than in banks .	-4.0272
That is why millions of people in the region turn to Pfandhäuser after families feel pressure on rising costs of living and increasing budgetary and consumer debt .	-3.1986
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans , owing to a relaxed financial policy in the developed economies , families with lower and middle incomes are seeking Pfandhäuser to compensate for the difference between driving economies .	-5.4666
This week , the rating agency described Standard & Poor 's growing budgetary debt , mainly through rising mortgages , as a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.1551
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the Agency , have the highest budgetary debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-2.9758
Malaysia stands at the top of the list , an increase of 60 % in 2008 .	-2.7064
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has come out of a technical recession this week .	-3.4383
On Thursday , the data showed a further existing weakness of export and a reduction in consumer demand .	-2.9744
“ In the end , that means that , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to complement their incomes wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.5865
Historical maximum levels of gold prices in the last two years have increased the trend towards pledging personal items , as people use the opportunity to transform the jewellery of the family into cash .	-3.9153
In Singapore , approximately 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 Pfandhouses of the Gold State .	-3.5362
People say , “ The gold price looks good , let us plunge Gold Chain and back next month . ”	-3.3607
The largest Thai Pfandhouse operator , EasyMoney , has experienced 20-percent customer growth in the last few months .	-3.3563
Growth in the Pfand business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the Bendemeer Filials and 15 more in Singapore wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four homes – but also outside Asia , as Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.4495
The company is financing this by 60 % of the $ 66 million this week by the Singapore exchange rate .	-4.7175
While some lenders have gone to the crusade because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that pandhouses are not only favorable interest rates than others , but also raised debts .	-31.8930
“ Customers are borrowing items that they already have , and the liquid of personal values does not increase budgetary training , ” she explains .	-4.2502
Pfandbond transactions are increasingly accepted as short-term financing .	-2.8226
Nor are all people who use the debt in financial difficulties .	-3.0572
Rich people from Singapore also come to the ValueMax branches to plunge gold bars and rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 percent of the purchase price in cash .	-3.4258
Customers come from every social class .	-2.1236
“ These include prosperous people who borrow something for business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow , ” says Yeah .	-3.5391
Sometimes they just need very quick money .	-10.2857
NSA Data from Google and Yahoo - Snowden wants to help	-2.8429

Rescue package over $ 325 million for Tasmanian health care	-2.6766
The Australian Government is on the hard conditions linked to the rescue package of more than $ 325 million for Tasman health care to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money .	-3.9636
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek announced that Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.0521
Four years after government discussions , Andrew Wilkie 's independent Tasmanian MEP was decided .	-4.4321
“ The government has picked up an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” said Plibersek today .	-3.6511
The $ 325 million package immediately includes $ 31 million in electoral services .	-2.6792
Another 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey star , are to be eliminated .	-3.0074
Moreover , there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better success for stationary residences , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-3.8526
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected me have said that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-2.9376
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman Government .	-2.2167
The state must retain the current level of financing in order to be able to obtain money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where the extra money was spent .	-4.2170
A three-headed Commission will be established and should ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-2.9160
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be little to use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasman public health system to a more sustainable course . ”	-3.5519
Nevertheless , he praised the government for reacting to his request for urgent aid , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.2989
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state ’ s public health system away from the list of concerns , ” Wilkie said .	-3.6054
According to the government of the state , these electoral services will largely compete the recent cuts .	-2.8045
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ plaster solution . ”	-2.6577
“ We are in today ’ s situation , because the Labor Government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said towards ABC TV .	-3.1065
It cannot be that a government almost half a billion dollars tears out of the system and the Commonwealth involves 300 million , and then do as if the good news is goo! the !! ! ! !	-14.0102
Dutton asked Plibersek to ensure that not one dollar of the rescue package is spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.4328

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , such as a surveillance group	-2.6683
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas munitions , the global surveillance group for chemical weapons on Thursday , while in the north of the country there have been serious mergers close to one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are being stored .	-4.9019
A Syrian activist group also announced on Thursday that more than 120,000 people were killed soon after three years ago since the start of civil war .	-3.0382
The announcement of the Organisation for the Ban on Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date of deadline	-2.7035
1 November , which was set by the Damascus organization based in The Hague in order to destroy all facilities for the production of chemical weapons or to make “ inoperable , ” including all machines for the mixture of chemicals into toxic gas and filling of ammunition .	-5.2099
The completion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-15.6588
The destruction of institutions means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons any more .	-2.5038
But Damascus must still begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-2.9349
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and Nervengas Sarin .	-2.3079
The announcement came at a time when struggles were held in the city of Safira on Thursday , experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites , as the Syrian Monitoring Centre for Human Rights based in Britain .	-4.2885
The activist group pursuing the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria declared Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-3.1272
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-1.4672
On the part of the government , 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias leunI asa a s!!!!!!	-10.6370
Also among the dead were 2,202 army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition , many of them foreigners .	-2.8736
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.1493
This figure has not been updated .	-13.5357
The conflict has forced around two million people to flee from the country .	-15.9749
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting against the rebels for weeks in Safira , many of which have connections to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.6301
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday but did not call details .	-2.6552
The struggles underline the danger that chemical weapons inspectors face , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a civil war .	-3.6222
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and experienced its destruction and destruction of all of Syria ’ s important manufacturing and mix / filling facilities . ”	-4.7277
That is why “ no further inspection activities are currently being planned . ”	-2.2722
Earlier this week , the inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus .	-3.5463
Because of security concerns , two institutions were not possible , the inspectors said .	-2.7259
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that , according to Syrian statement , both locations were “ abandoned ” ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapons program were shifted to other institutions that were inspected . ”	-18.3104
It was not clear immediately whether the site was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.4167
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee .	-2.4848
“ I draw the hat of the brave and the courage you have shown when you meet the most challenging mission ever executed by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director of the Monitoring Organization Director , in a comment published by OPCW .	-4.4722

Anger about Bali ’ s Bomb League	-3.4039
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 in the Bali bomb attack were angry about the judgment for the last incitement to justice , as Umar Patek should be shot standard .	-6.5646
Patek , who was on the flight almost ten years as one of the most sought-after persons in Southeast Asia , was condemned yesterday for his role in building explosive bodies for the bomb to a prison sentence of 20 years .	-5.0851
He could be dismissed with criminal suspension after 15 years .	-2.8530
The 45-year-old mass murder was found guilty of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.3200
A debt was also made in a number of terrorism-related charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on sacred evening in 2000 .	-3.5059
The Public Prosecutor had asked for a lifelong prison , even if she could have requested the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a masterpiece of bombing , as a “ demotion man ” .	-14.4488
The decision awakened painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth , who lost her 39 years old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastation that Patek and his co-conspirators made almost ten years ago .	-4.6583
With tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-1.9724
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other kerle .	-2.3308
“ One should put him before a shooting command , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-3.0928

Following the attack , he fell into the coma and “ died ” three times a month , while reaching a living system .	-4.8723
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-2.6287
Really , this type should be given the death penalty , above all .	-3.7240
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to let him alive .	-2.1940
Twenty years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds , is not much .	-2.3196
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber who stood before the court .	-2.9087
He removed nearly a decade of arrest , but was finally taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011 , where US armed forces killed al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later .	-4.0464
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the connection between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.4172
“ He did not stand up , ” Corteen said .	-2.4173
Until recently , he has shown no repentance of how much suffering he has added to other people .	-3.0804
This year 's decision was taken before the ten-year anniversary of the attack , commemorating Bali and Australia .	-3.4972
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.3339
Patek can still appeal against his judgment .	-1.7540
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but no mobile calls )	-2.7463
Passengers can now hear from departure to landing their electronic equipment for reading , work , games , music and use films , but do not phone with the mobile phone , so the new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the US  .	-14.5027
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.4022
How quickly it would implement , declared by the respective airline , FAA staff Michael Huerta declared at a press conference .	-3.4607
The airlines must show that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they updated the training manuals of the airlines and the rules for the development of the devices in accordance with the new rules .	-16.2474
The FAA has already stated that it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.6467
Delta and JetBlue were also among these airlines .	-1.5709
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could authorise the extended use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced in a release .	-3.3129
Currently , passengers must switch off smartphones , tablets and other equipment when closing the aircraft doors .	-13.0232
They may only start again when the aircraft reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-4.3847
When you enter the country , passengers must return to them and not start before the aircraft has landed .	-4.7848
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are safeguarded against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the devices even when starting , landing and rollfield , the FAA declared .	-4.4103
Most new traffic aircraft and other aircraft transferred to larger levels for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.2725
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Association of Professional Airlines , welcomed the changes .	-1.8928
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented glading .	-3.2445
We are frankly sorry to have to feel like feelings on this subject .	-4.0924
Nevertheless , Internet connections to surfing , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data among three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained . even the of of !	-12.8934
Passengers are asked to put smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .	-2.8532
So no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble similar online game that played the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines because he refused to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked on the road .	-4.2594
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be surprised as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-3.7282
Mobile calls continue to be prohibited during the flight .	-2.6527
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.3222
FAA may lift bans on certain electronic equipment at start and landing .	-3.1607
Last month , Mark Rosenker said from the National Transport Safety Authority Safety Board , security experts on national transport issues on CBS News , mobile phones would still be at risk .	-2.9161
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not just because they could cause potential disturbances in navigation equipment , but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmission masts , ” said Rosenker .	-4.0024
A consulting committee of the industry , established by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allows for a wider use of personal electronic equipment .	-3.9401
In recent years , pressure on FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-2.5306
Critics such as the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri take the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban .	-2.4008
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of equipment has become everyday .	-4.1675
In some studies it talks about forgetting or ignoring up to a third of passengers .	-2.6769
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passenger travel after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment became known by passenger UK radios , which were then the latest technical trend .	-5.0206
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed in such a way as to allow them nothing to do with electronic interferences .	-3.6268
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi passengers for several years when the airport is reached .	-3.7314
The flyers adjusted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences .	-13.9793
The overwhelming majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said Huerta  .	-17.4218
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally reduces radiation much less than previous generations .	-2.7760
For example , e-readers only distribute minimum radiation when sheeted .	-3.5604
But when downloading or sending data , transmission values are stronger .	-1.7894
Amazon.com is the advocate of a relaxation of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers .	-3.9639
In 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger aircraft full of childle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not identify .	-3.7517
Members of the FAA Consulting Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.3733
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the disruption by the device is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-17.2254
Other members of the Committee said that there are only single reports from pilots who talk about disruption of aircraft systems through the devices , and most of them are very old .	-13.8203
However , the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to place passenger switching off equipment in bad views .	-22.3697
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a sensible adjustment to travellers , who would be extensively equipped with technology today .	-4.2581
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognises that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security , ” said Roger Dow , U.S. Travel Association CEO .	-2.7111
Returning bird saved again by North Sea Bohrinsel Air ESSAEES SSE .	-14.8695
A service to the coast of flown birds , exhausted on a North Sea drill , was released once again .	-3.6388
The waterrall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was piled up by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa .	-3.8847
Colin Seddon , head of the centre , said : “ This waterrall was probably a winter bird from Northern Europe , held by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-3.5946
Apparently , the exhausted bird refuge on the drill .	-2.9796

Is Europe 's elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-8.5105
Business for Britain was launched in April to bring the economy to a table and define what those in Britain want to change prosperity and work with our relations with the EU .	-3.2438
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey under British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-2.8751
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 leaders from the economy , which represent the British sizes , sectors and regions .	-3.9637
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.6030
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernise and grow while stagnating EU states .	-3.3820
They want new trade links with countries such as China , India and Brazil to be favoured by government , rather than halting the long and decisive process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-3.5565
When asked for their view on certain legislative issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be retracted to Westminster .	-4.4859
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , because , according to the statement by companies , the costs of Brussels would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed that are traditionally the most European .	-4.8284
Finally , and probably the most probably , our survey of economic leaders showed that a significant majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement , not a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .	-4.6838
This recognition , found in businesses of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ sensible change ” that brings the boost of action back to Britain .	-4.9205
It is a matter of much – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a referendum of 16 % in favour of a change of opinion in favour of leaving the EU .	-4.3656
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership .	-2.8766
It also shows that businesses expect a significant shift in power back to Britain from renegotiating them . undera new ! ! ! !we are ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! !!!!!	-13.6168
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is now moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.5399
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain , as shows the result of our survey , which means increasing attention to trade and fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.4347
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasara	-2.4729
The construction beginning of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is one of the largest European energy projects , the Gazprom Board declared .	-16.3657
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction work at the Bulgarian section of the South Stream Gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , ” said the CEO of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a declaration on Thursday .	-3.5442

A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine , where most Russian gas is stored for Europe , ensures an increased risk in conventional routes , as is official .	-3.6666
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “ outsourced for ever at all ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-14.9356

Consultation before the Royal Commission : two YMCA staff accused of Jonathan Lord for sexual delicacies	-3.1393
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were accused of children because of sexual delicacies , before 2011 accusations against the child care carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were raised , as the Royal Commission for the sexual abuse of children .	-4.7851
But in the opening declaration before the Commission , YMCA declared that “ the organization never had an incident of sexual abuse of children .  ”	-4.8970
Managing Director Phillip Hare was questioned about a case in which a YMCA staff had been accused of offences with child pornography , and another , condemning a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 for the abuse of children entrusted to him .	-4.9878
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case , but did not know the second .	-2.5867
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s declaration of opening to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that ‘ there have been external YMCA reviews in which YMCA was recognised as the foremost front of child safety ’ .	-4.8552
Instead , evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.6302
Hare , who began with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the management had “ failed to downward ” the Lord ’ s attitude and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report breaches of child safety directives .	-5.4697
Lord was sentenced to twelve boys during his two years of activity for the YMCA because of sexual offences .	-3.7240
It was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.5212
But Hare disputes that YMCA would have a cultural problem that employees had prevented from reporting Lords ’ infringements of children ’ s security .	-4.6918
The employees said that they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , she was privately cared for as a baby sitter , let them sit on his lap , said he loved it , and let children play with his mobile .	-5.4671
Danielle Ockwell , whose supervisor Lord had asked for a training for child protection , because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the children ’ s service leader , Jacqui Barnat , who was subjected to Lords in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidable and most of the time was very inappropriate . ”	-5.4913
The Managing Director said that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have failed to refund their submitted reports .	-3.7843
Instead , he said , has affected her friendship with Lord her judgment , which is why she did not report it .	-4.6904
Hare explained that he told the Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to draw the organization from the “ Jonathan Lord ” incident “ does not affect the notification ” by employees , and the Board agreed to it .	-4.9819
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations briefly after the accusations occurred was taken by the managing director of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-3.5398
He said that it should prevent evidence from being contaminated , which was “ over-effective ” and badly implemented .	-3.9617
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation in the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , declared Professor Stephen Smallbone by the Griffith University , expert on sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-3.8394
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in attitudes , verification , implementation , training and supervision of employees .	-3.2025
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-1.0192
Tony Blair explained he would take the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-15.5913
In an interview this evening , on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59-year-old proclaimed his views on various domestic issues .	-3.1295
Since its resignation in June 2007 , after a decade of state leader , Blair has largely avoided expressing its views on British policy , and its comments usually restrict its comments on foreign policy and its role as a mediator of the Quartet of peacekeepers in the Middle East .	-5.1807
Whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that it happens , that ... ”	-3.7343

His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great span . ”	-2.0836
They had to oppose the entire participating field and gold pocal and rosette gone from the course .	-4.7868
It was only the second time that he had participated in a competition with toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-2.8485
Full foreign in the Arena thought him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-11.4528
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his Tante Sharon Howells , which has been presenting horses for more than 10 years .	-12.1168
Howell ’ s told : “ The whole audience was like electrized , and everybody was fired and clattered . ”	-4.8307
He ran on sand the whole length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did a fantastic job .	-3.3679
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to look after .	-2.9583
As it starts , it will not take long for it to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and I am sure it will cut off well .	-3.9196
A spokesman of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.6666
Together they are a great team .	-1.1493
The jurors evaluated fenton and toffee afterwards how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the lead .	-3.7707
They respect good cooperation between Pony and Leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-2.4993
I am sure that Fentons sweet clothing has contributed their part to making it really perfect .	-3.6400
Chinese Newspaper Should Reform	-2.3332
A Chinese newspaper , which had asked for the release of a reporter accused of diffamizing , should be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-3.6702
The Neue Express based in Guangzhou had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.4717
But Chen later admitted on television that he had adopted bribes to counter reports on a partial company .	-3.2443
Now the new express will be subject to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-2.8466
The “ Rectification Order ” came from the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and TV in Guangdong .	-2.2120
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several untrue reports between September 2012 and August 2013 on the listed company Zoomlion .	-3.4342
“ The New Express editorial management was disorderly , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-2.2867
She said that it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and deprive his report licence . ”	-3.3281
Moreover , “ Yangcheng Evening News Group needed to make a full rectification of the New Express and recommended to identify the relevant responsible at the New Express and immediately check the New Express leadership team . ”	-4.3970
Chen had written several articles for the New Express , in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoom .	-12.9092
After he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the title side and put his journalistic work behind .	-2.7848
But then Chen arrived in government television and admitted that he published false reports against payment .	-3.6467
“ In this case , I have damaged Zoomlion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he said to the CCTV state news channel .	-3.8045
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-2.1287
It has become clear to me that I have acted wrongly .	-11.2038
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page and said that it failed to properly review the reports .	-3.3719
Several well-known suspects have recently placed confessions on television .	-2.8518
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced , despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities have been prohibited , to force someone to accuse themselves .	-13.7483
Drug tunnels with their own railway between the US and Mexico	-11.2223
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electric rail operation , has now been discovered .	-3.2125
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres of measuring tunnels as one of the most sophisticated passages ever found .	-3.1886
The tunnel that runs in the sample pattern over a length of just six football fields , connects storage halls near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.6753
In the area there are countless inapparent warehouses , making it easier to hide trucks with drugs .	-3.5793
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported in it , the authorities declared .	-2.3944
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured , so the records of the court .	-3.7309
Three men who worked as drivers according to the statement of the authorities were charged because of the possession and the intended sale of Marihuana and cocaine .	-3.6873
They threaten prison sentences between ten years and lifelong .	-2.4121
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers place on an extensive underground network of dismissal channels .	-16.2931
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-1.9914
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of bringing their product to consumers quickly .	-3.4624
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 metres long passage with railways from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-4.0216
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr	-9.4721
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate routes in the future .	-2.2313
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love themsel   a  .	-14.9338
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn .	-1.8117
Actor Orlando Bloom expressed his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.3677
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , bloom said , " life sometimes does not run as we plan or hope " .	-3.5687
Kerr and he himself still loved , emphasised the 36-year-old .	-2.3518
" We will support each other and love as parents of Flynn " .	-2.1500
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and their Söhnchen Flynn was born in 2011 .	-2.3196
Veganism , according to Lexica , is subject to vegetarianism , but it differs significantly from that .	-3.6050
After all , while vegetarians allow for consumption of sahnet locations , ice or a powerful edamar , these worms are not on a vegan menu .	-5.2732
Milk , cheese , egg , in addition to the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan leaves the vegan from all consumption animal products - also honey is renounced .	-4.9076
What remains , one might wonder , but if you look closer , the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable incident .	-4.9147
" Breadfasts are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.0737
Reuben Proctor is happy to visit the loading in the Domgasse .	-2.7875
For 13 years , the born New Zealand vegan lives in Lampertheim , he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I did my diet and became vegetarian " .	-4.1760
At the turn of the century , the next step was taken and I became Veganer .	-2.5199
" The conviction came not only because of the diet , but because of the foot choice , " Proctor says that the art leather prefers normal leather .	-4.1772
He recognized that in other day-to-day concerns , too , there are no animal products .	-2.9902
The first is vegan an ethics .	-2.0180
" I do not want animals to die for me " , Proctor speaks out the maxim of vegans that stretches across the consumption behaviour .	-3.6775
Instead of trusting burgers , rubbers or rubber bears , the Vegans quickly discovered new products that increased enthusiasm .	-3.7794
" It is a double bonus , " says Proctor today " really does not represent any waiver , no ascese , but it is an enrichment " .	-5.0984
And it is precisely these conditions that some of them were still so well meant to fail .	-5.1361
" The search factor is a very important factor that lets many quickly give up , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-4.0486
And approach : " Certain tastes are not to determine the animal " .	-4.6068
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste .	-2.6402
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " the vegan clearly shows .	-3.5069
For example , Proctor brings with aubergins , champignons and a few vegan sausages .	-16.1266
It respects a balanced , varied nutrition , where it should taste delicious tastes .	-13.6721
Of course , you want something between teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.6801
" It is to taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food , " said Proctor .	-2.8493
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , he did not suffer . any of thesuffering lesunder lemenleleslesleleslemenle	-16.8812
For me , the conversion had a positive aspect .	-1.7821
I do not take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share .	-2.7536
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan .	-1.9426
" My blood values are best , I leave me often checken " , betrayed proctor .	-3.0684
In particular , before the lack of vitamin B12 , many vegansimus critics warn .	-2.3220
" Because animals are fed with feed instead of grass , it is questionable whether in the meat buying in the cooling tree , the vitamin B12 share is high , " Proctor finds .	-4.6620
For vegans , there is also the possibility of taking the coenzym in the form of tablets .	-3.2173
" My B12 values are in order " , he explains .	-1.9621
For ways , proctors do not need to go for food procurement .	-3.9390
Fundamental food is everywhere , and each supermarket has soyamilk and other products .	-14.4535
All I need is on the ground .	-1.7322
Only from and to buy something special .	-2.1464
" Many people overlook that only products are expensive , but that is how it is known for " ordinary " products .	-3.9389
In any case , the preparation of vegan courts is much cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly accepted .	-3.2528
" In the house kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small bars you can find good if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-4.5690
Margarine instead of butter , a little more backpowder and carbon acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring its silence parents to an astonishment .	-4.4527
Family festivals give the vegan a new root .	-2.6042
This has a new importance if you cook together .	-3.5802
" The situations that can arise are as different as people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.4964
Of course , he has already been scepticised .	-3.3561
Do you not taste my meal anymore ?	-2.1287
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if such questions you have to act as a vegan with a fingertip sense .	-4.5570
" I do not reject people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be enclave dates .	-3.2596
And , more precisely , the everyday world then does not seem to be as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not limit itself as it is commonly accepted .	-5.1889
Also Fast Food is permitted .	-1.3801
Pommes everywhere !	-1.9414
" Many donor shops offer Falafel or a vegetarian Yufka " , says Proctor .	-2.8308
In a pizzeria he extends to pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , everything of habit .	-4.1263
The restaurants are so slow .	-10.2030
" When I started feeding vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult " , the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , draw attention to it " .	-3.9911
" When enough demand comes , they may be inclined to supplement the menu " , he hopes .	-2.8618
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the combination of Mannheim or the café bird free .	-2.9639
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants also have a vegan menu on the menu .	-3.0442
Basically , vegan dishes are there for everyone . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-9.1106
Everyone can eat them , so they are precisely the opposite of exclusive .	-2.0557
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they close others , " proctor detects .	-4.0143
" If you want to avoid food scandals , Veganism is a safe way to make the most part impossible from the outset , " says Proctor .	-2.8928
However , purchasing vegan products may be somewhat difficult at the beginning .	-2.9130
In particular , if one learns to understand that can also contain animal additives as colour donors in nuts , it seems that we leave the courage with so many hurdles and traps quickly .	-21.4362
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - Animals and their alternatives " explains the many content substances , food and cleaning products .	-3.6247
" After and after , you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to respect " It is sometimes better to do than stand or stumble , " white proctor .	-4.1343
Veganism , he is an important moral fingersheet that beats awareness .	-2.9578
Perhaps he does not manage to put his habits in place , but at least he can teach consumers to ask his habits critically .	-3.6667

British police make Assange a delivery certificate	-2.9348
The British police have today handed over a delivery model to WikiLeaks founders Julian Assange , who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for asylum .	-11.9491
Scotland Yard declared that the 40 year old Australian were “ asked to make him appear in a police guard , and added , if he failed to comply , threaten him to arrest .	-5.9110
Assange is threatening to deliver to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exhausted under British law since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-4.6215
As he fears that Stockholm will deliver to the US , he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.1201
Scotland Yard asked “ a 40-year-old man to place himself at a police guard that we chose , ” said a speaker .	-4.5138

Tax on foreign real estate owners against London ’ s speculative bubble	-1.9471
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on housing in the 2012 budget , which costs more than two million pounds , as well as annual charges for buyers , housing as a company and not individuals .	-5.0571
Already , revenues from the stamp tax on housing ownership in the districts Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which were in 2012 / 13 at 708 million pounds , revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , north-east , Yorkshire and the Humber region were combined .	-4.8885
Cook said , “ Following the increases in the stamp tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the legislation against circumvention , it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the outdated community tax system . ”	-4.5668
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained in buying real estate in London , or selling owners from it , ” he added .	-3.1763
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market after price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt , which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon , has expended by the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-4.4515
The prices in Central London had an even annual annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market ” in which the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such an investigation of Saville .	-4.4892
Scientists were able to throw more light on the context of a dog 's tail pursuit .	-4.1501
Previous research showed that happy dogs were woven with the tail more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while in nervous dogs it was the left side .	-4.7989
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to them .	-2.3824
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist of Trento University , said : “ People know well that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli causing positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.2290
Here we tried to look at this at other species .	-2.1026
He also noted that dogs were the right brain half for the movement of the left and vice versa , just like humans , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-4.4508
To learn more about how dogs respond to the side of their types of kind , researchers monitor animals while these films looked at other dogs .	-4.6242
They measure the heart frequency of the four beings and analysed the behaviour .	-3.3506
We will probably soon understand why tail is moving in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-2.7144
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown dogs with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate different aspects , and we could control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-3.8318
When animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wedding ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-3.8572
But when the tail was mainly left ( returning from the perspective of the dog who were woven ) , their heart frequency rose and they looked disquiet .	-5.5614
In the view of Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these mountains .	-4.5495
Instead , he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not .	-3.8262
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wavelength is more linked to the tail in a direction with friendly behavior and the right produces a less friendly behavior , then you respond on the basis of these experiences . ”	-5.5555
The researchers say that the knowledge of dogs owners , veterinarians and trainers could help better understand the emotions of their animals .	-17.9918
John Bradshaw , expert for dog behavior and gastipendiat at the faculty of animal healing customers at the University of Bristol , declared that this was not the first study in which it was investigated whether left and right is important for dogs .	-4.7540
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and to the right , when it is a satisfied dog .	-4.0042
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs go to a robot dog when tail ‘ left woven ’ and not right , rather than becoming disquiet – exactly elsewhere than in the Italian study . ”	-5.3767
According to his statement , the differences could stimulate that dogs in different studies did not interpret animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs .	-3.4393
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.2070
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain half are used for different purposes , many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are not exceptional , ” says Bradshaw .	-4.0538
But simply because their behavior is recorded , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-4.4803
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow for the disease Alex Turners	-11.9331
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys postponed a performance in Glasgow after her lead singer is ill-headed .	-4.0087
The band from Sheffield should play in Hydro on Friday .	-1.5817

Pope Francis appoints February ’ s First Cardinals	-2.2170
Pope Francis will first appoint new Cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-2.4653
Cardinals are the leading clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also they who choose a Pope so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor .	-4.2255
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.2611
However , a cardinal that reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the paper election – a group of 120 “ electoral cardinals . ”	-3.5489
In an explanation in which the news was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman of the Vatican , a meeting of all cardinals will take place before the ceremony to appoint the new cardinals , known as the Consistory .	-4.2895
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce its decision to convene the Consisting Board in February in advance so that other meetings that require cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-3.5081
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals will probably have fallen until February .	-2.4713
He declared that a Pope normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of electoral cardinals return to 120 , and so many cardinals over 80 , as he wants .	-4.0953
The Consistory is important next year because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Valero .	-2.9647
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and in particular Italy .	-2.5788
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-2.0254
Fourty percent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-13.0261
The cardinals will also be the first to be called since the Council of Cardinals established by Francis to find a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the mission to find ways of reforming the Church .	-4.1476
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-11.8358
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-1.9466
He said that it is “ well possible ” that Francis should ask the cardinals for advice .	-3.0974
But we have not been in this situation until now – all of this is completely new .	-3.4655
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would call cardinals , but Francis is “ full of surprises – we do not know who he appoints . ”	-3.6101
GM calls back new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seats .	-2.7973
General Motors call back almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with the year 2014 to address a problem with the manually adjustable seats , a communication from the US Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Safety on Friday .	-4.5537
In some of the cars , there may be a defect in the mechanism for returning the front seat lens .	-3.7794
That is why they do not meet the German Federal Regulations on vehicle safety at head restraints .	-3.6187
“ When the head restraint is driven from back to the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the insasses so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” it was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website ( NHTSA ) .	-5.2757
The called models were created between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.1686
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the main start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvence-related restructuring in 2009 .	-2.9506
GM informed vehicle owners in the first october half about the defect .	-2.4547
NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-3.3937
The sale of Silverado and Sierra trucks , which were redeveloped for the 2014 model , had increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , GM declared on Friday .	-3.6825

My class camerades weeped before joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-2.6809
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.1780
When Obama switched to office in 2008 , he had approval levels of 82 % .	-13.2186
And then I close the book .	-1.2870
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening , as if one is running out of a dream .	-4.7534
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – it seems to be a vague memory , a sad warning of missed opportunities !	-11.2663
In the years when I voted for the first time , something has changed .	-3.1314
But it is simply not what I could have imagined .	-1.9798
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.0650
I too believe that the party political blockade tactics have tilted too many efforts to promote our nation : reform of immigration , a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few .	-4.7810
But after I have defended the Obama administration on colleagues and friends many times , I have come to the end with my declaration attempts .	-4.5179
I have reached one point of political despair .	-1.5025
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows foreign leaders to listen or kill innocent children through drones overseas .	-15.0780
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ’ private life and why whistleblowers are punished , public misconduct is disclosed .	-3.8095
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , a US citizen without procedures , is still being circumvented by public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections .	-3.8159
It does not justify the results of a report which says that the White House ’ s efforts to reassure the media are the most aggressive ... since the Nixon Government .	-14.6606
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-2.7857
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected .	-1.4687
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict the political campaigns that it has led .	-3.8764
Obviously , the Members ' Office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public discussion .	-3.5538
But if I look at the examples above , then it seems to be largely elected by the government itself .	-14.1586
And that breaks me the most .	-2.5982
I chose Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.8594
With Romney , a confusing and unbalanced alternative was that he did not seem to be able to establish his direction and positions .	-3.5000
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , freely from the pressure of future elections , would meet the hope that we had heard for so long .	-3.1726
But , with Obama ’ s approval values below 45 % this week , return to 2008 has become so harder through this book .	-3.2105
It inspires me to look for the many promises that have dissolved into air .	-3.3972
This week I read a section in the book that describes how Obama had to make a heavy loss against Clinton in the primary elections in Pennsylvania .	-3.5478
At a meeting with the electoral helpers after the decision , he said his staff that they had to come back to course and follow the purpose of their cause .	-4.3218

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interest in parental leave	-2.2361
The billionaire and Member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interests in his plans to parent leave because his daughters might become pregnant and therefore benefit from it .	-3.8803
The mining magnate , which is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax , claimed when he wanted to get questions from the table whether he was in a conflict .	-15.0294
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important in deciding whether or not the CO2 and mining building taxes are cut .	-3.2321
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws .	-2.3977
“ He is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not it receives holidays , ” Palmer said .	-3.4205
Two months after the election , the Palmer election commission officially declared 53 votes lead after the new count to win the Sunshine coast seat of Fairfax .	-4.4025
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting votes , so that these faster takes place .	-4.5654
Tony Abbotts Daughter Frances and Bridget .	-1.0766
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.3013
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-1.0202
Why not have a system where you march the data into a computer immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 am in the evening ?	-3.9560
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking the ballot .	-3.4973
Does it be used because we can then arrange the results if they do not like it ?	-4.5382
Today with pencils is incredible .	-2.3184
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint proposal with New Zealand .	-2.6051

RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers	-2.1172
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global authorities ' investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is taking a fast journey .	-4.7275
Some of the world ’ s biggest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 billion a day changes the owner .	-11.8074
The two retailers would be the first RBS employees , suspended in the extensive investigation that leads the scandal into the Libor interbank business .	-4.8511
The Bank , which did not make a comment on suspension , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .	-2.4708
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” the bank said two weeks ago .	-2.7335

UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that it examined the alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-3.7341
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have discussed transactions in the currency market .	-3.8973
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said with the situation familiar people .	-2.8416
Banks come through Instant Messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-3.1284
The news about these investigations has turned traders into an area which has been one of the most profitable of the trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .	-4.6517
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leaders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-2.8679
A leading retailer noted that , despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trade , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to the fact that “ it can already affect the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-4.7871
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she announced this week a trader of her London Exchange Traded Fund office after he had caused a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.1107
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and works with them .	-2.0024

She wanted to draw attention to the risk of even larger ruins in the Swiss meadow - should one day fail .	-4.0685
In conversation with many passengers in front of the " construction site " , it became clear that some citizens believe that it will be many better to achieve the city 's project , even though not few have the same questions to the dimension of the project presented as the BI .	-11.7085
But they start to resign because the city continues to delay these answers , it says BI .	-14.6156

Recent occasion for Rangnick ’ s criticism was Yellow for Mane at 3 : 0 against Grödig last Sunday , when Senegalese became an alleged actress to happen - not , of course , as the TV images showed .	-5.5357
" A crass mistake , " Rangnick said that Harkam referred to as " completely overburdened " .	-4.1479
Harkam would also have contributed to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the partie .	-2.4691
He defended his German countryman : " Here I would have been the same in every situation as Roger Schmidt " .	-3.8224

“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are in good direction to record revenue before interest and taxes , ” he said .	-3.9204
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which typically belong to our strongest results .	-2.6283

The next Ecumenical Talk Forum on Monday , 21 October , in the New Museum of the Castle , is about the topic " Zur Hell with hell - theological considerations for today 's handling of the last things " .	-5.1868
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.4034
The Ecumenical Talks Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant Church of Salem , Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance .	-3.4554
Johanna Rahner wants to follow the question of how people today classify " last things " after death .	-3.3085
Had people known too much of it over the past centuries , putting on those pictures of sky and hell , " which until today shape our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic teaching of hopes to complete more than through a certain embarrassment or even language .	-6.8274
" The greater hope has been expelled by religious critique by Christians , " says the Referentin .	-3.3381
They " supplied us with so many questionnaires that the exclusion signs seem to have gone away . "	-4.8675
Johanna Rahner says : ' But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death ' .	-2.2106
This is the question of those who dream that everything may be good at the end of the day .	-5.6399

Not only in terms of performance , the whole range of athletes was represented .	-3.4849
The age structure also ranged from ten years in recent to more than 70 years at the oldest starters .	-3.4697
More absolute topathletes were started this year .	-2.5311
Four drivers were able to depart from the regional top d!	-13.2518
This includes Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike half-profi from the black tusk racing team .	-3.3403

Dr. Georges Bwelle brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon	-2.0058
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend with treating hundreds of patients	-1.9149

Dr. Georges Bwelle is one of the top 10 of the " CNN Heroes of 2013 " .	-1.8568
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose the “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-3.2122
The winner gets $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-1.9540
For 21 years , Georges Bwelle saw how his sick father lost awareness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-2.8848
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.3950
First , he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation that expanded to his brain and caused a hematom that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-17.4636
“ There was no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” said Georges Bwelle .	-2.2786
We would have put it out of Cameroon if we had the money .	-2.1375
Instead , Bwell spent years accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.5291
“ It is not easy , ” commented Bwelle .	-2.0823
You can leave the hospital at five o 'clock in the morning to be the first time , and yet it is not the first one .	-4.0984
There are many patients .	-1.2013
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.4721
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell ’ s father died in 2002 .	-1.8343
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people , the World Health Organization .	-2.4969
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is a doctor of 413 people .	-2.4332
But even if there is a doctor for them , most cameroons could not afford to visit .	-2.4217
Two of the five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country are privpart  . !	-10.2452
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-1.5557
And poverty makes life impossible .	-1.0707
His father and so many of his countrymen suffered from seeing Bwelle the decision to do something about it .	-3.1855
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer carried out 700 free operations last year .	-1.3867
He was himself doctor and worked as a surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-2.6992
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels in rural areas weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.6986
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-1.9014
Almost every Friday he constrained and up to 30 people driving in small buses and travelling with the healthy equipment on the roof over unfortified terrain to the villages needing help .	-5.8629
Not everything runs smoothly .	-1.9093
They had to put vehicles through rivers and sludge more than once .	-2.9033
But when they arrive , they are received like heroes : a feasting , singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.7012
In these villages , free medical care really is a reason to celebrate and bwell – with its wide smile and its borderless energy – gladly celebrate the cheerful celebration .	-5.4047
Next morning , the team will start investigating hundreds of patients .	-2.4868
“ Per drive we treat 500 people , ” says Bwelle .	-3.3011
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and walk .	-2.5420
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.2283
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually communicable diseases .	-1.6716
Other crucifies , donated glasses or free birth customers – a document needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.6045
In the evening , the team executes simple operations with local stunning .	-2.5644
The operations typically take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the intervention the patients stand up and go in the area of recreation to make space for the next .	-4.6423
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the Group 's generator and work thus Bwelle and its volunteers to the early hours on Sunday .	-4.7946
It is a busy pensum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.7510
“ You drum the whole night so that we can stay away and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-2.8906
On Sunday the team then returns to the city , tired but proud of the work that has been done .	-2.8918
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with their work it makes a huge difference to the people they help .	-3.7073
One man said that the free operation of a breakthrough he received now allows him to work again .	-3.5488
“ This changes the future of my family , ” said the man .	-1.9241
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle is also working in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.3154
With this second job he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , Bwelle ; the rest comes from private donations .	-2.4603
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and cooperates voluntarily in Bwelle ’ s group .	-3.1424
It is always in hospital or tries to spend money on the organisation so that it can go to these campaigns .	-3.2323
For medical and health care students like O 'Malley who come from the US and Europe and support Bwell , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-3.1376
“ We can be in operations where we help to dump blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , ” says O 'Malley .	-15.4804
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.5764
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitation material .	-3.2079
But once in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over the accommodation , the transport and the guide .	-3.0582
" He is no doubt a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-11.0773
He devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits .	-2.6266
For threshold , almost constant work is not a burden .	-2.5178
Helping others to live a happier life , thereby fulfilling a promise that he has given his father , prepares him great pleasure .	-5.0446
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-1.4099
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.0201
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.2377
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve pain .	-2.6710

Mastering the War Excellently	-1.6693
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingways Novelle " The Old Man and the Sea " , is Horst Janson cut to the body .	-3.0110
Janson himself is an old hare in his metier , acting art .	-2.5265
The old man Santiago cannot do anything about fishing .	-2.4176
So the two are great complements .	-2.8563
You almost think you can see the folds in the nakes of the old man , of whom the fishing young Manolo speaks .	-4.6580
If Santiago tired of life bears on the chair , it is real with Janson .	-3.3530
In addition , the role of old fishermen and a character role that excellently masters Janson .	-3.7243
Hemingway told the history of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish by his knowledge and his will .	-3.7410
Janson is on stage in much distance as the sole display .	-4.1190
He manages to focus on the attention of the audience , so that his monologists are not boring mo!. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-13.5422
Its efforts to finally draw fish to the surface of water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is only made up of blue lighted water bottles .	-4.0955
Director Jens Hasselmann leaves the old man in front of the fishing village .	-2.3977
During the performance he puts the active scene in light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , which , with her songs and her beautiful voice , is the feeling of life of Cuba .	-5.0952
The four musicians play Cubas Rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-3.3800
Tourism : Departure to the Romans	-1.1009

Those who visit Cologne will not get off the Dom .	-3.5237
Around 157 meters reach the two towers in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.6280
But few visitors who stun the two filigree towers suggest that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-3.9378
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne 's underworld .	-1.9705
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne Tourism directly on the Cathedral .	-3.2960
The tour starts very unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " says Schulze .	-3.1490
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted an auto-fair city , and that is why the rest of the old city walls remained what was not too big .	-5.0960
Most users of the park house are therefore passing on to the Roman remains and only put their car off .	-4.8554
But those who look more precisely at the Parkdeck D2 discovered an archaeological site separated by metallic bricks .	-15.9181
Five metres high ruins of hand-large stones are visible .	-4.1222
" It is the remains of the Roman city walls , built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " tells school .	-19.2809
Before returning to the daylight , Schulze lets participants take a look at a dark 15 metres deep chess at the upper park level .	-4.7560
This is the well of the old dome , which unfortunately is hardly perceived .	-3.2777
The next station of the tour is the pretorium and here the participants get down to the depth .	-4.0133
We are experiencing the official seat of the once-most powerful man north of the Alps , the Pretor of CCAA .	-3.5592
What CCAA means is a visitor .	-1.7333
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in good English as much as " city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius on the place of the Altar for the Kaiserkult " .	-4.7284
And the Pretorium is the former Statute Palace , the power centre of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-3.6892
From the preference of the exhibition a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel , which is preserved here at around 120 meters length .	-4.6482
" You can go along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want " , school cleans up the guests .	-4.5660
A surprise still has school .	-1.8936
After holding the key at the box , he leads the group to a 16-metre deep chess .	-4.6582
" We are now in the mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-2.2536
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground to come to the groundwater that was indispensable for the ritual washings .	-19.7585
To this day , different waterstands can be read in the bottom of the mikwee , whose origins date back to the eighth century by changing levels of the Rhine .	-4.8279
Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the town hall square for which the construction work will soon begin .	-4.0937
But several years will pass until completion .	-2.7205

The Public Prosecutor accuses them , together with unknown complices in Finowfurt , cancelled and beaten on three men in a car in June 2009 .	-4.4089
All victims were seriously injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .	-2.4590
The victims should have heard the competing group Hells Angels .	-2.3611
One should have been a high-level member of Berlin .	-1.8383
Apparently a tracking hunt with several cars was preceded .	-2.5996
According to the charge , it was about review fights and a demonstration of power .	-3.4531
The two defendants had been released in a first procedure in early 2012 .	-2.9264
A court spokesman said at that time , it was unable to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody mistake .	-3.5617
The perpetrators had borne masks and had not been recognized .	-1.5814
