Doubling US Artificial Intelligence Spenditure	-1.8110
While China becomes more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investments , says Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI practitioner who worked for Google , Microsoft and Apple .	-2.8130
These demands were created after US government members made announcements to KI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.3850
Meanwhile , China has presented its plan last year : by 2030 it wants to be number 1 in the field of KI innovation  .	-14.8247
“ A doubling of AI research spending would be a good beginning , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in KI research is just before , ” said Lee .	-4.5739
The doubling of financing could double the opportunities that the next achievement in the US is achieved in artificial intelligence , said Lee CNBC in an interview this week .	-3.5112
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( KI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the new world order ) was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company invested in one of the most famous Chinese KI firms , Face + + .	-3.3167
In the 1980s , he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system defeating the high-level American Othello player .	-18.2156

Macedonia votes in a referendum on changing the country 's name	-2.5266
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed in ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece which had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-3.4315
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial right to the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.2625
The two governments concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name in June , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-2.4667
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum and , given a boycott campaign , there is no doubt that the result will create the 50 % barrier , which is a precondition for the validity of the referendum .	-3.8122
The question on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-13.3176
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing the inclusion in bodies such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-2.9675
“ I have come today to vote on the future of the country , it is a decision for young people in Macedonia to live freely below the roof of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.0328
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will adhere to the outcome of the vote so that they can become crucial .	-3.6882
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for changing the name .	-17.4285
The Committee on Landtag said at 3 p.m. that there was no reports about irregularities .	-4.0579
However , the turnout was only 16 % – in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 , at the same time , the value was 34 % , and in the end , 66 % of registered voters had given their vote .	-4.7937
“ I have gone because of my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.3566
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister , Mr Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica , and his son Dushko , have given their voice to the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country ’ s name , which would pave him the way for accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.7882
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and set chairs before the tents established by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.1872
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to participate upwards with the heads , not through the service door " , Kavadarkov said .	-10.7899
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.3139
If you do not want us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.5464
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring urgently needed investments to Macedonia , a country with a unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.0184
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev declared his vote .	-3.0237
According to him , the “ yes ” outcome would be a “ reinforcement of our future . ”	-2.6224
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-2.3250
Another survey carried out by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of those surveyed will give their vote on Sunday .	-3.3646
Of those who want to participate , 70 % gave “ yes . ”	-2.2346
The referendum will only be accepted if the turnout is over 50 % .	-3.0489
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policies of the pro-Western government since its takeover in May last year .	-2.6605

Aguero made his hit at the 65th minute simple look .	-3.9157

He surrounded a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton criminal space .	-3.5641
Then he made a passport to the left and gave off to Sterling .	-2.6059
The English stormer used his first contact to play back to Aguero , which then shot with right – past Brighton-Torwart Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gate .	-3.8164

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.5634
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.8811
As momentum activists in my local party voted in favour of criticising me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.3971
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour Members who have said that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-2.9978
My group colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly because she has resolutely resisted anti-Semitism .	-2.6398

In the East Labour communication meeting in Nottingham on Friday , it says : ' We want the meetings to be integrative and productive ' .	-2.9287
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour Member , the GC meetings on Friday evening were just that .	-2.8630
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a more " friendly , gentleman " politics is long forgotten when it ever began .	-3.9425
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion will be judged on whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-3.6753
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s office , because the colleagues I thought before that I had a similar political attitude expected me to take a turn and take positions with which I would never agree , whether in relation to national security or the EU internal market .	-5.5770
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – follows a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for election , denounces the Centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-3.9592
This experience has not only been made .	-2.4746
I do know that more happiness than some of my colleagues , because the comments that address me tend to be political .	-3.3052
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are subject to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never shock .	-3.0558
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the scale of abuse has normalized .	-2.3995
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.5203
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and with any motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules the party becomes smaller .	-3.4398
I have received plenty of advice over the last two years to collect my neck , not to be so loud , and then I would be “ in order . ”	-4.0728
But for this reason I have not come into politics .	-2.6239
Thirty years ago , as a student , I joined Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , which neglected my classroom , literally collapsed . As a result , I tried to use better public services for those who need it most .	-5.5721
I never hid my political views , not even at the last election .	-2.1970
As far as my political positions are concerned , no one in Nottingham East should have been in any way confused , and the same applies to areas in which I do not agree with the current leadership .	-3.2637
For those who supported the motion on Friday , I would just like to say that I do not understand why they waste time and energy to remain loyal to me and to the Labour Party if the country controls a Brexit that is damaging to households , businesses and our public services .	-11.0935
But the only message I have does not go to Nottingham momentum , but to my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not threaten to choose or political opportunities from work in what , in my opinion , is the best interest of you all .	-4.1879

John Edward : Language skills that are essential to global citizens	-1.8725
Independent schools in Scotland have a success balance of academic top quality , which continued in 2018 with excellent audit results , including individual and group successes in sport , art , music and other Community enterprises .	-4.4870
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland , these schools are represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , seeking to offer their students and parents the best service level .	-2.9260
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further training , including universities , their desired professional career and their role as world citizens .	-3.7596
In the educational sector we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , and we note that modern languages in schools remain popular and desired .	-3.3770
Nelson Mandela once said : “ When you speak to a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-3.3381
If you speak to him in his own language , he ’ s heart . ”	-2.8305
This impressively shows that we cannot just rely on the English language if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries .	-3.0427
The test results of this year show that languages at the top of the tables with the highest existence rates are in independent schools .	-3.0695
68 % of the students who have studied foreign languages have reached higher class A .	-16.5039
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 % of students reached a “ higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among students who learned German , French and Spanish , each reached 72 , 69 and 63 Note A .	-3.8589
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in future .	-2.3683
Language companies have the same rank in independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , natural science and technology ) .	-3.3961
A British Commission survey for employment and qualifications from 2014 showed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulties occupying free jobs are attributed to a lack of linguistic knowledge .	-3.7195
Therefore , language knowledge is increasingly needed to prepare young people for their professional future .	-2.2276
With more prospective employment opportunities that require languages , these skills in a globalised world are essential .	-3.3330

By means of the possibility of communicating directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of the competitors .	-2.8724
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a discussion , and French is the only language that is spoken with a double-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.5234
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-2.4322
When children learn to speak several languages – particularly those of developing countries – they later have better chances of finding sensible employment in the labour market .	-3.0289
The schools in Scotland differ in terms of their language offer .	-2.6506
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in terms of 2020 , such as mandarin or Japanese .	-3.0767
Whatever your child is interested , there will always be a number of languages in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this area .	-2.6340
Independent schools in Scotland want to offer a learning environment that is well prepared for children , they should receive the necessary armor for their success , which always may bring the future .	-3.9493
In the current global business world , languages are undeniably important for the country ’ s future , and that must also be reflected in education .	-3.4475

Trump is certainly going to mention the hearings held this week about the accusations of sexual abuse against his candidates for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office by the Senate has been postponed until at least one week ’ s FBI investigations have been completed .	-8.0845
The main objective of these electoral events , however , is to mobilise the Republicans , who face a crucial election in November .	-3.0930
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilise volunteers and supporters with the five electoral events next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-2.9208

Ryder Cup 2018 : The Team USA is ready to fight to maintain hope for the Sunday singles	-15.0467
After three unilateral meetings , the four games on Saturday afternoon probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.9095
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that the players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-3.5872
So where would they say now ?	-1.9217
“ You had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so there is a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew for the day . ”	-3.6252
Europe is , of course , in advantage of 4 points , and twelve others still have to be played .	-3.5461
However , the Americans , as Spieth says , feel somewhat wind in their sails and there was a great deal of encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played the whole day together and have three of four points .	-4.5672
Spieth was considered from the outset and set a good example .	-2.7804
These sound jewelry cries were louder than his round went down a crucial putt to reach an indecision in game 4 after he and Thomas lagged 2 points after 2 games .	-5.6855
His joy about the Putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was so that one thought that he was still believing in the victory of the Americans .	-3.8806
“ You really need to concentrate on your own game , ” said Spieth .	-3.3164
That is all that each player remains .	-3.5417
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.3289
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only player with more points than game and thomas .	-2.8423
Europe ’ s strange but admirable pair plays errorless and simply makes everything right .	-3.5770
" Moliwood " was the only pair that did not reach a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but it also avoided them in Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning the nine .	-3.7868
This course and the way in which their energy and flows from this outstanding quantity of spectators appears to be flowing , makes it the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes over Le Golf National there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-6.0753
Probably both at the same time on different holes .	-3.0283
To speak of a European victory now would be too premature .	-2.0138
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren on the morning .	-2.5182
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine rough the Spaniards and Swede into a hole from which they never came out again .	-3.6516
On Sunday , however , there is no one who helps you out of your hole .   ! !!!!!!!!	-9.9773
Because of the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-provided advice and the way a strategy can change in the hand-turning , it is very fascinating to watch the fourballs and foursomes close by .	-5.4681

Europe Leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Finalday	-2.7299
Europe will take a solid advantage of the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the fourth and fourth games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-4.0821
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a struggling Tiger Woods to bring its previous record to four points in the Le Golf Nation .	-12.0607
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who argued for the preservation of the trophy she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team with suspenders in the morning , and won the series with 3-1 .	-3.9090
The US offered more resistance in the fourth and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.5195
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games from Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.7031
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend " Molliwood " , are only the second pair that wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.8809
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat a sober wood and the American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.3265
Woods , who torn through two parts on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 parts in four-balls and four-balls and seven in a row .	-4.7988
Justin Rose , rested for the morning fourball , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and proposed in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – one and three in the world .	-3.3807
In a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.4847
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the standard for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-3.2216
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourth pack and returned later to beat poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-person pack after they lost the first two holes .	-3.9933
Only two times in the Ryder Cup history returns a team from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Holder Furyk 's page needs only an indecision to keep the trophy .	-4.2399
After two days of second-best , however , a Sunday account looks like it would go beyond it .	-3.3019
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” unilateral disarmament without trust	-11.4434
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that it would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such circumstances .	-3.1926
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Body ’ s annual General Assembly that North Korea took significant goodwill measures last year , such as the attitude of nuclear and missile tests , the depletion of nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.5954
" But there is no corresponding US response , " he said .	-2.4068
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances , there is no way that we will first disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-3.0670
While Ri adopted the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , rewarding North Korea with gradual steps , his explanation seemed significant as it did not completely reject unilateral entuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-3.8984
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an acting US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June , when Kim committed himself to working towards a ' denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ' , while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-3.3728
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korea war in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.5522
Washington also resisted the demands for a relaxation of the hard international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.5624
The US insisted on " denuclearization first " and increased pressure through sanctions to mandatory achievements , and even reject the " statement of war " , Ri said .	-4.5024
" The perception that sanctions can force us into the knee is a dream of people who are ignorant of us .	-20.5085
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-2.0986
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President emphasised at the United Nations at the beginning of the week .	-2.8143
Instead , the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea ’ s leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added : ' If the Party were to such a dead end on this issue of South Korea ’ s denuclearization and not the United States , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be falling into such a dead end ' .	-5.3438
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. , the General Assembly that visited the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called “ missile mission . ”	-4.6756
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ destroy North Korea completely , ” praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must stay until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.8863
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no time frame for it and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.0069
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.5508
However , in the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo , the UN said : Security Council on Thursday that ' enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without failure until we achieve complete , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-4.4964
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the financing of nuclear and Ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang   .	-17.2289
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he will travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.6790
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last journey did not go well .	-9.3008
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress was made , and only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him to make him “ similar demands . ”	-4.5081
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex when the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.1872
He said that Kim said to him that the ' corresponding measures ' he sought were security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.5314
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough quiet .	-9.0786
With a new course this year at Harvard University all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the “ performed nights . ”	-3.9415
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often toothless when it comes to helping themselves , even though it is a very simple mechanism .	-13.7878
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the US .	-3.3627
He was inspired to start the course after he had kept a talk about the effects of sleep shortages on learning .	-3.0345
At the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why are I said until now , in my final year , ?	-3.4052
She said that ye never told anyone about the importance of sleep – what surprised me , " he said to the telegraph .	-14.2848
The course offered for the first time this year explains the foundations for students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-3.5052
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatric at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the Health Service of the University , said that the University decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-3.5192
The 1-hour course contains a number of interactive tasks .	-1.9651
In a section there is a picture of a sleeping room where students click on coffee facilities , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of café and light and about how sporting performance influences the lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep time routine .	-5.1988
Another section explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart infarction , stroke , depression and cancer .	-3.6204
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-2.1027
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-1.7863
" But we believe that they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Czeisler added .	-2.8826
The culture of pride still exists a " night " , he said and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on students and students makes sleep deprivation a growing problem .	-4.0199
A sufficient sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion , and fear , he said , not to increase , because sleep withdrawal translates the brain into famine mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-5.4137
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-2.9979
He said that the course had opened its eyes and inspired him on a campus-wide course .	-2.4725
The next step , hopefully he hopes , is to ask all doctoral students to complete a similar programme of study before entering the University of Competition uniununiunities  untiunasununder !unun!!!!!!	-14.0574
Prof. Czeisler recommended the students to set an alarm when they go into bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting that can bring their circadian rhythm out of the tact , leading to problems when sleeping .	-5.0043
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal is Gerrard ’ s Men	-2.3405
Further problems of rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , Livingston came to the 1-to-0 defeat for the different team of Steven Gerrard .	-4.7723
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since the 4 : 1-Triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as a trainer who left his team back eight points behind the disappointed Ladbrok ’ s premiership chiechchiat   H .	-18.4932
Menga landed seven minutes before the mid-half-time a hit and an inspirationless Rangers list did not look like it could balance them .	-5.0539
While the rangers now fall back to the sixth place , Livingston climbs on rank three and lies only because of the tornal difference behind Hibernian .	-13.7136
New difficulties for the rangers are revealing , because Line-Calum Spence had to be supplied with a head wound after he was hit by an object – apparently thrown out by the foreign fans sector .	-6.1103
Gerrard made eight changes to the page that passed on to Ayr and directly into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-3.5752
Holt , on the other hand , raised the same Livi-Elf , which declined the Hearts last week , and he would have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team left the opponents at no time for action .	-5.2075
Although the rangers dominated the ball owner , Livingston set opportunities better .	-4.0401
You should have met after just two minutes when Mengas first department Scott Pittman sent towards Allan McGregors Tor , but the middle field player passed his great change on the          !! !!!!!	-13.1110
Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot a long way towards his post .	-4.3241
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than consuming in their own game , in the last third .	-3.0614
Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that after the first quarter of the first hour he deserved an elf meter after he and Steven Lawless conflicted , but Steven Thomson arbitrated not on the Colombian appeals .	-6.1017
The Rangers reached only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly by Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head and the hit of an unprecedented Ovie Ejaria .	-5.0756
Although Livi ’ s opening meeting might have been against the game during the 34th minute , no one can deny that they have earned it for their efforts alone .	-4.4849
Again , the rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-12.2142
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the calm and picked out Menga for a simple finish .	-3.6313
During the break , Gerrard traded Coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-3.9140
But Livingston repeatedly drew guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett following long balls .	-3.8635
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership in the final stage , but McGregor stood well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow passed from the corner .	-4.0727
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another late claim to a penalty because he had devastated himself with Jacobs , but once again he saw Thomson away .	-3.5305
Almanach : The Inventor of the Geiger Counter	-8.4035
And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger was born in Germany .	-3.0855
A method of identifying and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as the Geigerteller .	-20.8489
Since then , the Geigerteller has become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s the film " Bells of Coronado " , which apparently improbable cowpoke-scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans imagin sscient :	-19.5644
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-1.5681
Rogers : “ It is a violent counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.1327

Evans : “ Let us say , but now it brings enormous ! ”	-4.0767
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , only a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.7485

A vaccine shows a promising result for patients with a number of types of cancer .	-13.9427
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw her egg cancer disappearing for more than 18 months .	-3.0762
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many types of cancer , and then inject the cells again .	-3.4476
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : " Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-2.3082
HER2 “ promotes growth in various types of cancer , ” including breast , eggs , lung and darm cancer , declared Prof. Berzofsky .	-2.9482
A similar approach to detecting patients immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-2.8134

After listening to his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while he carried a Make America Great Mutz , he helped against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.8130
" So often I speak with a white person and she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.2392

Although it was not broadcast , Wests ’ film material was shared by Chris Rock in the social media .	-3.6096
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post .	-2.6515
West also complained at the audience that he had had had had it hard behind the stage , because of his head coverage .	-3.6298
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.4260
They said : ' Go not with the hat there ' .	-2.5832
You have annoyed me !	-2.4614
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.0881
West continued : " Want to see the failed place ? " and said that he would attract my superman because that means you can not tell me what I should do , you want the world to move forward ?	-4.5615
Try it with love . ”	-2.0986
His comments were quitted at least two times by the audience and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to be moved , reported variety and quoted one person with the words : “ The whole studio was total . ”	-4.3670
West was used as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-2.5945
West wondered many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , dressed as Perrier Bottle .	-2.3511
West received support from the Conservative Group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who twittered : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : DANKE , DASS DU DICH DER MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST " .	-3.3009
But Karen Hunter talked that West is simply " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-3.3962

Review of Johnny English – You live only three times – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-2.9611
It is tradition to search for Brexit clarifications in every new film with British tendency , which seems to be applicable to this revitalization of the Johnny English Action Comedy Spoof Franchise .	-5.1833
Is the ironic self-satire about the humanity at the bottom of the nation 's export opportunity ?	-3.9571
In any case , the glotty , rubber , and incompetent Johnny English have received the license for the second time to remassage things , showing wona comic  creation  with gre reach  desi for no!	-21.3981
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent , who , despite his bizarre claims to Smoothie-Glamour , has received a little clouseau , a spray Mr. Bean and a clack from this kerl , contributing a single note to the guiding melody of fire cars at the opening of the Olympic Games in London in 2012 .	-11.3616
It is also based on travellers and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the forgotten Barclaycard TV shows , leaves chaos behind .	-4.5594
There are one or two nice moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.9456
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor , and the main rotor beats briefly against his hel     .    a      a	-13.4081
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands such as 007 and mission impossible self-confidently comedy as an ingredient .	-3.3419
The humor feels as if he is more directed to children than to adults , and for me the mad mistakes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean class movies .	-4.6766
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.7758

And that means that the full-patsy Johnny English itself , who is now employed as a school master in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as a Undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy over spy .	-5.2687
English is reunified for an emergency briefing to Whitehall and reunited with his former , long suffering Kumple Bough , who is once again played by Ben Miller .	-4.1857
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overwhelming , burschikose role where Vicki Pepperdine does not come to the validity .	-3.9994

Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously in the bann of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to resolve the United Kingdom 's computer problems : the darker Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.5143
English and Bough start their odyssey of colorful highjinks : When Kellner dresses , they reinforce a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board of Voltas Luxusyacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to make familiar with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Volta ’ s house .	-19.6273

A high-level source from the Labour Party said that a review of policy is likely to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.8238
A four-day week is an objective that coincides with the Party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of workers and the general industrial strategy of the Party , but that will not be realised overnight .	-14.3336
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign .	-2.1515
However , this advance is currently not supported by the whole Labour Party .	-3.0623

But how successful has Global Citizens been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.6656
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way of persuading people , calling for action , or simply a different case of so-called ' clicktivism ' - people who feel real distinction through the signing of an online petition or an online application , or by sending a tweet as if they were making a real difference ?	-5.1413
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , more than 19 million “ actions ” has been recorded by its supporters who pushed for a variety of goals .	-3.3043
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-2.8999
In early 2018 , the Group introduced 390 bets and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid out or financed .	-3.3332
The Group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct influence on nearly 649 million people around the world .	-2.6207

As a response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.3429
Global citizens responded : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.0175
Like the major civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-2.6723

Washington can “ if necessary ” take back to its marine to prevent Russian energy reaching the markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-3.4112
Zinke led to Russia ’ s commitment in Syria – especially in activities to invite the legitimate government – a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.7310
“ I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is the following : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.7754
And , according to the officials , there are ways to avoid this .	-2.3849

Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that is itself called “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.6339
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran , and stated that they are actually the same .	-2.9427
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he said Russia as a " one-trick-pony " with a fossil fuel economy .	-3.8880
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquid gas to Europe and replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-3.4174
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to stop Germany from the “ inadequate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Berlin , according to Trump , would “ prisoners . ”	-3.6237
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar-pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters , is a purely economic project .	-2.7411

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior for his sexuality .	-2.6543
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he has grown up with the feeling of being subject to everyone because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to be a success .	-4.1276
The 24-year-old said that he was only aware at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-2.9281
In the first issue of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 , he said to Lauren Laverne that he publicly spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-2.8590
He also said that victory for the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.3947
The regular presentative of the show , Kristy Young , has released several months due to a disease .	-2.5926
Daley first appeared in Laverne ’ s program and said that he felt “ less worth ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-3.6703
He said , “ Until today , these feelings of the leniger value being and the otherwise have given me the power and strength that I needed to be successful . ”	-14.3550

The Vulnerable Mickelson sat on the Ryder Cup Saturday at the Bank	-2.5950
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder cup game , but he drastically does not have to improve his form .	-3.6801
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was placed on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.1327
Instead of standing at the centre of events , as is so often the case for the US , the five-time major victors shared his day between fire and practice rounds on the golf course , in the hope of overcoming his depth .      a a a a      .	-14.9889
The 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver at the height of his career and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-3.8140
As if the place were not enough alone , Mickelson meets on Sunday on the British-Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-4.1887
When Americans launch the 12 individual games four points and start hot , Mickelsons Match may be absolutely crucial .	-4.1517
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband ; he remained otherwise .	-3.8802
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.1526
“ He has much confidence .	-1.5893
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-1.9988
Probably I would not have thought he was playing two games .	-2.2032
I wanted to see more , but we think we have had to tackle it once and for all .	-4.9671
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.0603
So far Nick Faldo keeps the record about most played matches at the Ryder Cup .	-3.3288
This could mark the end of a Ryder cup career , which never matched to the levels of its individual record .	-3.8151
Furyk , on the other hand , said that his presence would have been invaluable for the team .	-3.1760
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to maintain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room " he explained .	-3.8435
I think the younger players had fun this week to measure him , that was nice to see . ”	-4.1267
He offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.5041
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.2724
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the last day ’ s individual games can quickly become an inconvenient ride at the Ryder Cup .	-12.4606
The Dane debated in 1997 in the game in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only just over the target line and won with a scarcely thin lead from 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-4.8485
" They remember that they were in leadership in Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only scarce , " said Bjorn , after he said the Class of 2018 , now leading with 10-6 in Le Gulf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-5.6293
History will show me and all in this team that it is not over .	-2.2844
You will be absolutely boring tomorrow .	-1.5888
Go out and do the right things .	-2.1502
Only when the points are displayed on the table .	-3.1618
Our objective is to win this cup , and we focus on it .	-5.8782
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-11.7472
As his players have played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be forward .	-13.3150
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.3944
Tomorrow the personal performances are coming , and that is another matter .	-2.4727
It is great to be out there with a partner when things go well , but if you are out there alone , your abilities as golf players are tested on the whole .	-5.6530
That is the message you need to send to the players : tomorrow the best to get out of ! !	-13.2516
Now you get over to your partner and you have to get full use just like you . ”	-5.0003
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to cut off individually better than they do as a partner , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have taken three of four points .	-4.1934
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turning at the end of the day , when he was part of the winner team in Brookline , now he is among the losers after the European team has carried out the “ Miracle of Medinah ” .	-4.3570
“ I remember every condemned word , ” he said to the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the 1999 captain , had gathered his players on the way in the last day .	-12.9800
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get rid of as quickly as possible , as we saw in Brookline , Medinah .	-3.4190
For the first time a self-dynamic has developed , the big pressure on the middle matches is exerting .	-4.4499

Renewal of the German War Ship	-10.9453
The latest fregatta of the German navy should have been placed in service in 2014 to replace war vessels from the Cold War period , but it will take at least until next year because of faulty systems and escalating costs .	-5.3928
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the guide of the brand new fregatts of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , so the newspaper “ The Time ” was appointed for a military speaker .	-4.6212
The navy should have operated the 2014 ships , but serious problems after the first delivery were burdened with the ambitious project .	-3.6300
The four frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered in 2007 by the Marine will replace the older boats of the Bremen class .	-2.8143
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a number of aircraft and ship missiles , as well as some Stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures led to .	-14.7264
Another important advantage is maintenance intervals : the latest fregates should be usable for up to two years without running the marina .	-3.8725
However , the state-of-the-art warships that Germany will enable a power projection in overseas will already be outdated by constant delays when they are finally put in service , as the weekly newspaper “ The Time ” points .	-5.7482
The unfortunate F125 fregatte caused headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg .	-3.0070
This was the first time that the Marine returned a ship to a shipbuilder after the delivery .	-2.5865
The reasons for returning ships were little known ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the war useless in combat operations .	-3.8158
Software defects were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by an occupation of about 120 seafarers - only half of the occupation on older fregates of the Bremen class .	-3.7637
It also turned out that the ship has a significant overweight , restricting performance and making future upgrades more difficult for the navy   a      .	-18.6183
It is believed that the 7,000-tonne “ Rhineland Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships used by the Germans in the Second World War .	-3.0737
Besides faulty hardware , the price sign of the entire project - including crew training - becomes the subject .	-3.8256
Instead of the original EUR 2.2 billion , the cost now seems to have reached the dizzying level of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.5220
The problems with the latest fregatts are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power disappears .	-8.2274
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defense Committee , acknowledged that the war fleet actually “ start operating vessels . ”	-3.9098
The official official said that the problem has grown lavishly over time , since old ships were put out of service without replacing it .	-5.5791
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregatts were put in service by the Marine .	-2.4108

This information will help to identify the benefits of living space management as to how best to provide meadows and how to maintain forests for batteries and other related species .	-4.9059

He emphasises that it is important to examine whether battery mice is there before maintenance work in buildings , according to which it is possible to destroy a single sleep of maternal animals up to 400 females and boys – perhaps a whole local population is erased .	-6.9042
Battery mice are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , disturb or disturb them and destroy their sleeping areas .	-4.0820
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.8604

Ronaldo denies rape claims as lawyers sue the German magazine	-2.3765
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-3.4348
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ The mirror ” that published the accusations .	-2.6397
In 2009 he raped an American called Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas .	-2.6260
It should then pay $ 375,000 to keep silent about the event , The mirror reported on Friday .	-3.2637
Hours after the claims were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an Instagram Live Video referred to his 142 million followers as “ Fake News ” .	-3.3111
No , no , no .	-0.9746
What they say today , Fake News , “ said the five-time balloon D ’ Or winner in the camera .	-2.4538
“ They want to apply for themselves by using my name .	-1.5653
“ That is normal .	-1.0497
They want to draw attention to when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-1.8041
I ’ m a happy man , and everything is good , ” the player added smiling .	-2.4234
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers prepare a complaint against the magazine “ The mirror ” ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ an inadmissible reporting on privacy suspicions . ”	-3.5778
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would require damage to “ intangible damage to the gravity of injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years . ”	-4.3823
The presumed incident is to have applied in June 2009 in a suite of Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-3.4433
According to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in the US federal state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the room of the player where he raped them in at a a .  eva a !!!!!!!!!!!a !	-15.7739
Mayorga claims that , after the supposed incident , Ronaldo had fallen to the knee and said that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy , ” left by the “ one percent . ”	-4.8548
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had sex , but it was consensual .	-2.0395
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and had photographs made of hospital injuries , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had " fear of retaliation " and worried about being " publicly humiliated " .	-4.3775

Brexit : Britain would for ever regret losing car manufacturers	-2.1602
“ The UK would regret it time for Brexit to lose its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer , ” said Minister Greg Clark .	-2.6162
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK informed the BBC that they would temporarily cease production in their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.9184
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.1501
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the case of a no-deal brexit could cost jobs .	-2.7472
The plant in Burnaston , which manufactures Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.1287
“ When Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe it comes to production stops in our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO at Toyota in Burnaston .	-3.8491
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.9054
BMW , for example , has already announced its work in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-2.2641
The most important concerns relate to what automotive manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a " no deal Brexit " .	-11.5363
The production facilities of Toyota are based on need-oriented manufacturing , i.e. parts are delivered every 37 minutes of suppliers from the UK and the EU for special production .	-14.7669
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there can be delays at the border that , according to industry specifications , can lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-3.5949
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock in its plant in Derbyshire , said the company , and so production would be stopped .	-3.0194
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is ‘ calibrated precisely to avoid these controls on the border ’ .	-14.7934
We need to have a deal ; we want the best deal that enables us not only to seize the current success , but also to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the Today of BBC Radio 4 .	-4.4754
“ The reference not only to Toyota , but also to other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-3.1584
Toyota did not provide information on how long the production stop could take , but warned that , in the long term , the cost increase could suffer the competitiveness of the plant and finally lose jobs .	-4.4400
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives and in Burnaston for 24 years said that trade union members were increasingly concerned : “ I am experienced that jobs , once they are lost , are always lost . ”	-3.7599

Trump ’ s Rosenstein Meeting says the White House	-1.9696
Donald Trump ’ s high-calibration meeting with the Deputy General Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be ' moved another week ' , since the struggle for the Supreme Court Board Kavanaugh continues to read the White House on Sunday .	-4.6161
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser , Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia and the possible disability of justice by the president .	-3.6344
Whether Trump will fire the Deputy Public Prosecutor or not , and in order to jeopardize the independence of Müller , Washington has made a lot of Tratsch for months .	-4.0539
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the wearing of a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president over the 25st constitutional addition .	-3.5690
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.0890
But last Monday he gave himself to the White House , while reports had been that he was shortly before the resignation .	-3.8549
Instead , a meeting with Trump , announced at that time at the United Nations in New York , was announced on    a a a  a a a !a !!	-13.4536
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the session was delayed to avoid a consultation with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee , in Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-15.7125
On Friday , Trump arranged a one-week FBI investigation into the claims against Kavanaugh and continued to delay a full senatory vote .	-3.3210
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-2.2167
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A deadline for this has not yet been established , it could be this week , I could see that I shift back another week , given all the other things that go to the Supreme Court .	-4.2604
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-2.0890
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.4932
Guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-7.9562
Sanders said that the lack of briefings did not result in an aversion to television porters who behave like self-depictors , but she also said : ' I will not be opposed to them standing in the gallery ' .	-16.7376
It then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.7163
" The President carries out more questions and answers than any President before him , " she said and added without evidence : " We have looked at these figures . "	-3.2688
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but the press should have the opportunity to put the questions directly to the president of the United States , so that is finally better than to speak with them .	-4.1026
We are trying to do much about that and you have seen how we have done it over the last few weeks , and it will replace a press conversation if you can talk to the President of the United States itself . ”	-3.7782
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-1.9707
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.0659
In New York , perhaps this week , the President demonstrated why by making a free and sometimes bizarre performance before assembled reporters .	-3.6285

Dairy pump advertising , compared to mothers with cows , resulted in controversial online discussions	-2.6463
A dairy pump company caused controversial online discussions due to an advertisement compared to silent mothers with milk cows .	-3.9398
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " first clear and portable dairy pump " , Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered by this new pump .	-13.2974
Four real mothers dance in a witches in the middle of cows to a number with the following songs : " Yes , I melke but you don 't see cock " and " If you have not noticed that there are no euter , there are my breasts " .	-5.2750
The slogan continues : ' Pump , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump , I milk my ladies ' .	-3.7010
However , the ad published on the Facebook page of the company has provided controversy online .	-2.8206
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from spectators , many of whom say that it lights the " horrors " of the dairy economy .	-3.2517

The Elvie Milk Pump inconspicuously fits into a Still BH ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-3.2393
Another commentary : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.6969
But yes , why should we not advertise them for a milk pump for mothers who can retain their babies ?	-11.2772
Someone else added : ' That is an outside advertising ' .	-2.5472

The ad is a little crazy , but I taken it as what it was .	-12.4177
That is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-3.0485
Another commentary : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who feel abpumping ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and like " cows " .	-3.3664
That is not advertising that praises or assesses the dairy economy . '	-2.7617
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have danced all with the discreet pumps in their braces .	-3.1938
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say that they feel like cows .	-2.3588

Hundreds of migrant children quietly drawn into a tent camp on the Texas border .	-2.5090
The number of imprisoned children increased with migration background , although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policy made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-3.7989
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves and fear that they risk being referred to the country when they are committed to a child .	-12.6125

The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they are fearful or depressed , which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to flee .	-3.0952
Advocates said that these concerns are being reinforced in a larger institution , such as Tornillo , where signs that a child has to fight , are more likely to be overlooked by its size .	-4.4029
They added that the removal of children into the tent city without having enough time available to prepare them emotionally or adopt friends could exacerbate a trauma that many already fight .	-14.4282

The FBI investigations have begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-1.8160

Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to be determined ?	-2.0777
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-1.2596

Pelosi made the comments on an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.9403
“ I could not think otherwise that if a woman had ever behaved they would have “ hysterically ” , Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-3.6521
Kavanaugh denied the claims emotionally loaded that he had attacked Dr. sexually , Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young people .	-3.4262
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he wrote almost and fighted with the tears when he spoke about his family and his high-school years .	-2.7745
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated reputation campaign ” organised by Liberals , who are angry that Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016 .	-3.0123
Pelosi said that she thought Kavanaugh ’ s statement that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , because he showed that he was against Democrats .	-3.1956
“ I believe he disqualified himself with such statements and the way he can influence himself from the clintons and the democrats , ” she said .	-3.8085
When asked whether , in the event of his confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , it would seek a representative process against Kavanaugh , Pelosi delayed .	-4.2223
“ I want to say the following : if he says neither the Congress nor the FBI , he is inappropriate not only for the Supreme Court service , but also for the Court of Justice service at which he is currently employed , ” Pelosi said .	-4.9431
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. Appeal Court .	-2.3442
Pelosi added that she was a democrat concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade as he stands for conservative justice .	-3.1920
In its confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh raised questions about whether he would tip certain decisions by the Supreme Court .	-3.4396

China answers every US blow with a counterstream , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second largest economy will succumb in the near future .	-10.6746
Bringing Washington to direct means giving up the demands , but to bow publicly before the United States would be far too blameful for Xi Jinping , the President of China .	-4.3445
But if Beijing uses its chances correctly , the trade war with the US can positively affect China in the long run by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies , say experts .	-4.3227
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers adopted previously , ” said Abigail Grace , scientific employee at the Center for New American Security , a think factory focused on Asia .	-3.1891
