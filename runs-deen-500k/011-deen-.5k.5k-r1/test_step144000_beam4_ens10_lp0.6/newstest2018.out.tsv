Small-scale farmers manage the one-time reason for farmers .	-12.2714
The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories .	-1.6669
It nerves if maps are not up to date .	-2.0883
This is what everyone who has had to excite because the car navi instead of a bypass showed a green meadow .	-4.2767
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal of the State Government , are anything but topical - but it is very insightful .	-4.6256
Especially if you compare them with current online cards .	-1.8174
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the spread area of Munich Merkur since the 19th century .	-2.8370
The digital Bavarian atlas is a patchwork that you do not recognize as such .	-4.3164
The big overview card has been introduced for cities and communities more detailed maps , so-called urposition sheets .	-4.6094
According to the Bavarian Measuring Administration between 1810 and 1864 , the first measurement of Bavaria was established the Bavof measof measurments of the Bavof Meof .	-14.6425
Your client : Napoleon .	-0.8163
The French army leader has been occupying Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.9036
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic reception of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-3.0868
Even though the French troops eventually withdrew the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801 : today ’ s neighbors created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card .	-4.2629
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to drive the project forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian measurement administration .	-3.3794
The orposition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like any other on the website of the Bavarian Li!	-15.9641
The comparison earlier / today is the most impressive example of the capital .	-3.1170
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-1.9838
An example of this is undersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-2.3338
Sendling was incorporated into the map 21 years after the creation of the map in 1877 as a Munich district .	-3.8252
Today , undersendling is in the middle of the city .	-2.7835
Houses Untersendlings focus around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganserstraße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the insurgency of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-3.9523
Where the West Park is today , nothing is seen as fields - at first glance : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears : handwritten numbers from the so-called ' take-up ' , from which the tax was derived .	-6.0723
Small parcels are no longer proving farmers there - but small-scale farmers in the facility " Land in Sun " .	-5.6981
A large green area is north of Untersendling .	-1.9321
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the October Festival , actually was a meadow in the nineteenth century and not a concrete desert .	-4.0119
On the other hand , Isar gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.1828
In today 's Au-Haidhausen district , the Urposition sheet reads not only the street names " on the Gasteig " or " Lifts " , but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-5.2596
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstraße , people were once blocked with madness .	-4.3235
In 1858 / 59 the Munich circle irrenanstalt " On the Auer Lüften " was created there .	-4.0415
From 1872 , Dr Bernhard von Gudden headed the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II .	-3.7209
" He was progressive for his time , for example , ending the chains of so-called errors .	-2.9850
He also prohibited the staff from applying violence against the insects , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the Institute .	-4.3624
For 280 patients had been first place , then 500 seats were extended .	-4.1709
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for building the circle racing event in Haar 1905 .	-4.3086
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper Clinic of Munich has been one of the largest psychiatries in Germany .	-17.0653
The Auer Auer Anstalt area now meets young people in the Munich Salesianum .	-3.1307
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-3.2185
Western lies the football court of the TSV Munich East , east of the 1980s .	-3.0360
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built - in architectural approach to the origin of the Irish Ocean , which was destroyed in the Second World War in bombing attacks .	-5.1243
The Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as " Haupt Square " , the purchasing road was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.0250
The Second World War brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-2.5022
In December 1944 , the bombs of the Allied people passed many holes into the city centre .	-4.2314
A big stay remained at the Marienhof .	-3.3604
The English Institute , small business houses and an aerial chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich followed the second S-Bahn track .	-5.5991
The slider compares the old Munich card with the air picture of today - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-3.7579
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-2.0132
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policy and racist attacks by the State .	-3.3121
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to pay extreme caution , since a number of questionable , race-based incidents have recently occurred and are noted here in the state as a whole , " says in the opinion of the group .	-6.3808
A recently adopted law by Missouri , which makes people more difficult to win discrimination complaints , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , aimed disproportionately at minorities , led the group to publish travel warning said the NAACP .	-4.9408
" They have violations of civil rights that people are happening .	-2.2103
They are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten together or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.0001
" We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . "	-2.1691
It is the first warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .	-2.5319
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.0230
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel during the trip by the state and was customised by the police of Missouri without being accused of being accused of crime .	-4.1949
The Council also points to a recently published report by the Missouri General Prosecutor , which shows that black drivers in the state are frequently stopped 75 % more than whites .	-16.4096
" The recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees of what could happen in Missouri , " said chapel .	-2.7180
" People must be willing to bring deposit money or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-3.9457
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI Hass-Crime Report Programme , which classified the state with regard to the number of such injuries on the 16th rank of the country .	-4.3661
The warning to travel is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.5718
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws committing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for infringements of immigration , which , in the view of the ACLU , will contribute to further profiling .	-4.1619
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.3699
Gasting Project is Fundamental	-2.1266
The Fisherbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.3055
The CDU MEPs Peter White and Kordula Kovac have given an image on the ground .	-3.4638
At the Schwendemann family 's right-wing court , representatives of the Fisherbach CDU association together with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members met .	-3.6316
Markus Schwendemann initially provided insights into his operation , where he provides 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of woods , 40 milk cows and as many young pets as well as houses in five apartments participated in the house .	-13.0596
The Black Forest Milk is for him the alternative path for milk of his cows , so Schwendemann .	-3.5600
At the table of the holiday guests only comes regional .	-3.0992
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he described the grass project as " elementarily important " .	-4.0446
I cannot profit in such sharp areas .	-2.5126
The green area ensures a lot of work , much needs to be done with the engine sense .	-4.1289
" We have here to fight with the conditions and with topography , " stressed waste .	-10.0150
In 2003 he took over parental operation and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser , even if he did not run a bio-operation .	-3.5402
For mayor Thomas Schneider , the municipality recognized the importance of the pasture project and is glad about promoting leaders .	-4.4874
At the expense of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-2.9816
One hopes that this will lead to the afforestation of land a whole while .	-4.5191
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and who think about how they continue to operate " the mayor emphasised .	-19.8889
Farmers are often in criticism because of promotion	-2.2309
Twenty-five parcels of eleven participants were found in 2013 .	-3.8909
The opening surface is 40 hectares , which must not be forested up until at least 2023 results resulin until the end of of of the year. the of evof of evof , evthe of	-23.0128
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half were supported by leaders , a quarter wearing the municipality of Fisherbach .	-3.7623
Thus , farmers remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture .	-2.5680
" The great advantage is the longevity of the fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-12.3700
Kordula Kovac emphasised : ' You are doing a good job , without farmers and farmers ' .	-3.5108
For Peter White , too , stood firm : " This is the best food produced " .	-4.2059
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state promotion of grass fences .	-2.8517
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.5059
The existence of a support scenario called LPR is required .	-4.1910
Moreover , the indigenous area must not be slippery manageable ( hanging over 35 % ) and must be threatened by afforestation .	-4.5111
For the 2018 Fisherbacher grass project , the application of eight participants with 24 parcels currently wanting to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .	-4.5116
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-3.0273
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.9515
Trump ’ s White House Now is Freedom Statue	-2.6003
The safest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack statues .	-2.1159
The Americans appreciate them as well as any other - so the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.0732
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axt in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the proposals of the president to restrict legal immigration into freedom statue .	-3.8228
To stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.7258
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it .	-2.4530
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance that she was attached when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added 17 years after the completion of the monument , his base .	-3.8683
When Miller Acosta vaccinated : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-3.1341
The poem you refer to , which was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom . '	-2.5454
Miller is absolutely right , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.2340
It is about the contemporary response to the appalling words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Their mouths , thy arms , thy masses that look to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of thy rich coasts " .	-14.5973
There was never a time when the " waste " on our screens was better to see .	-2.2680
Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people were not welcome in Trump ’ s US         !  !	-11.9129
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict around the importance of America .	-2.9108
Lazarus - and their friends who committed themselves to placing their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they were taking a highly political  .	-14.0939
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in a classical picture that is used in a classical image .	-5.2531
Lazarus changed this meaning : in their poem the woman figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-3.2375
And she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the exilanants      a         a	-14.4640
The combination of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.1803
And , just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this long time .	-14.4765
The great cry hall Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of the Department of Trump , argued in 2010 that the freedom statue was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the nightmare world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.2710
It is to bear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.5549
The torch should not enlighten the path to the United States ' .	-2.6209
Limbaugh is fairly unusual here .	-3.5139
The importance of the statue is quite a matter of perception .	-1.8529
The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.7271
It is really a matter of seeing the world from the perspective of people , seeking refuge and a chance to improve their lives .	-2.9226
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.2096
That , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise .	-12.3776
Their torch is not to enlight the path , but to ignite the hatred that is their only source of power .	-3.8772
2017 World Cup : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom ’ s  !!!!!!!!!!!!!	-11.0892
Eilidh Doyle reminds itself of a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team	-2.7495
The United Kingdom 's light athletics director , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Cup will ' make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-3.4832
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-3.1053
Black believes that ' developing something special in Scotland ' and the UK 's light athletics must learn something from it .	-14.9004
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find out , " said black .	-2.6169
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that there is something to do with what they have done .	-2.2929
The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .	-1.8102
British light athletics : it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.1397
And also with the type of road corner .	-2.3649
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.7059
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal warders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will take Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to the team captain .	-4.1476
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.1883
Your speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.0230
" A series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-2.6083
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought were great . '	-3.0202
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take part in the 400m-m-hurdles during their fifth world championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-3.9221
Scotland ’ s best total of athletes at the World Cup was seven , achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.6243
Muir carried out on this path and last year has established five British and two European records .	-4.1174
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m running .	-2.2461
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot that should be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-3.9417
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in Team Lee McConnell .	-2.7692
The team captain says that she is " hugely proud " to the fact that many of her countrymen are not only part of the team , but in some cases also become part of the medals and the finals .	-4.7218
" The special thing about being team captain is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , it makes it too special for me , " they added .	-4.4000
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.1002
It only shows how far we have come .	-2.0154
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podia .	-2.0175
What my speech as captain ?	-10.7601
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.3881
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a World Cup .	-2.6627
It is therefore really important to support this home and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.3046
I get a second chance to go beyond and compete there , and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there ' .	-4.6464
Block critics about Facebook : Don 't apply for a public office if you cannot contract voters ' heating	-3.1929
The father of our country knew something bad press .	-1.7690
The Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers because of everything , from domestic policy to its political principles .	-3.1212
He was shipping with criticism , safe .	-3.4943
But he did not silence his critics .	-0.9102
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb , we will be held like sheep to battle ' .	-4.2100
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work on being more like Washington .	-2.2212
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook site .	-2.8617
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week .	-2.3458
The staff of the governor rescued the complaint as frivole , and the online commentary was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.7118
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-1.7302
But it is important .	-0.7315
And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan .	-1.9554
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-1.8948
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-1.8469
Hogan is not a reactionary heat .	-0.9543
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .	-2.4743
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means to combine with his constituents and playing his harless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-3.2300
Therefore , the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor , which is a public forum , which is referred to as official and paid by employees paid with public tax dollars , is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-4.6826
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of governor and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-2.7724
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online .	-2.1364
The mail spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.4019
And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a parish , no trolls .	-2.8199
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profan .	-10.5741
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-1.8780
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked for hate crime .	-2.5682
" I usually commented that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the comment sent by The Post .	-3.3109
" I do not appreciate this idea either when a number of people adopt a position on the same subject , they are more likely to be disregarded as so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of citizens concerned ' .	-5.1760
What the employees of the governor called " concentrated spam attack " would probably call others ' speech .	-3.5382
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.8180
It is much cleaner than in previous times if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guide articles or to arrest demonstrators and silence .	-12.4735
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.3368
Hogan is not the first public official to criticise the facebook and other social media .	-2.1713
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter fe .	-13.0103
One of the first milestones on this issue fell last week in Virginia .	-1.6246
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-3.5032
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.4329
That should not be so hard .	-1.9726
At the moment , Washington has had a similar effect on the time of affordable porto .	-2.8802
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous writers introduced his leadership .	-2.6805
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.0383
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters of newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-2.5372
Petitions that criticised his position on the Amity Treaty , trade and shipping with Britain were overwhelming , according to the historical documents collected by the online paper of the George Washington Project .	-3.5610
But he did not silence them .	-1.0205
Freedom of speech , difference of opinion and discourse are the basis of our n! !!! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!	-11.8040
And true leadership means accepting this .	-11.5708
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-1.6899

This event will be its first Scottish presence since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-1.4404
" It always means a little more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-1.8707
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .	-2.3321
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .	-2.2292
I am glad about what happened now . '	-3.1191

Less Lung Cancer Divided by PassiSSSASmoAs	-12.4979
In the last two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .	-2.0704
As a result , scientists of the Hamburg Eppendorf University Clinic ( UKE ) have come in a study .	-3.8140
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking every year , " said Manager Heiko Becher .	-3.2126
As a comparison , he raised his own study on this subject from 1994 .	-3.4961
At that time , there were 400 lung cancer deaths in Germany because of passive smoking per year .	-3.0709
The new investigation is published in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-1.6892
Domestic connections prove to be very complex	-2.3688
The construction works in Villinger Street are in full swing and " are somewhat in time " , so the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-3.9441
In the area of house connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because underground is hiding much , which is not mentioned in the plans .	-4.3944
Transport , which repeatedly hinders the construction work , is a major problem for the Stumpp company 's construction rupp .	-4.6346
" The ignorance of drivers against red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous " , Heinze reports .	-3.7341
The road is closed and only buses are entitled to go through .	-3.8852

It is a rare insight into the daily life of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was included in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders should vote in front of the occupying forces .	-3.7949
An existing movement that started for independence against Dutch rule quickly opposed the government of Jakarta , which maintains control over the region and excludes foreign journalists or legal observers .	-3.4689

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.2464
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland .	-1.5876
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is just 60 miles from Paniai , a highland province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.2270
In 2015 alone , Freeport reduced $ 3.1 billion of gold and copper .	-2.6742
Moreover , Papua has wood resources worth estimated $ 78 billion .	-2.1123
However , these wealth are a source of misery for the Papua that ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military preserves a stifling presence .	-3.0497
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military members and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.3508
Papuan ’ s demands for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated mercilessly .	-2.8355
According to activists , more than 500,000 papua have been killed , and thousands have been raped , tortured and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .	-2.4706

During his 2014 election campaign , Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi , promised to address the inequalities and infringements in Papua .	-3.3485
The former room secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the Presidential Palace in Jakarta .	-13.9264
But Papua has changed little , and today the locals feel cheated .	-2.6629
" Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , expecting it to fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-2.7424
In fact , only two months after Jokowi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai suffered a low .	-2.6001
On 7 December 2014 , a group of 11 children outside and sang Christmas songs before a storage fire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke down on a motorcycle through the darkness .	-10.2336
The frightened children told them that they should turn their headlights on .	-3.1429
One of the soldiers took off their tone and later returned with four soldiers , the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-3.5920
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their gunbags , said victims and witnesses .	-13.4954
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.2313
A child , the 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma .	-2.6230
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government committee was fired and things escalated next day .	-2.9564
Around 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered together on a football court in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-3.1078
They were ceremonial hunting arms and introduced the Waita dance - in the circle and imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago tribe .	-4.7127
Some demonstrators began to slaugh stones on police and military posts .	-2.9805
When the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command about an internal radio : " When the masses provide more than three times resistance , they shoot dead , " it says in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media .	-4.3212
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , head of the Kego Koto Quarter of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for calm and asked for the quantity to return home .	-3.4511
Nobody was listening in the mood .	-1.4185
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left-hand joint , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.1781
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the series of soldiers gathered here .	-13.1064
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-1.8210
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin , was the witness of the shootings .	-2.6342
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure that he was it , " Yohanes said , who , like many Indonesians , wears only a name , the TIME in grim mood .	-4.0231
" I saw he was dead ... I knew him . "	-1.3504
The chief spector of the Papua police , Yotje Mende , said that his officers only wanted to " safeguard " their station because it was attacked .	-3.1753
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.3948
" It is about life and death . "	-1.5221
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more were injured .	-1.7514
The news about the killings came only on the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta .	-2.3719
Three weeks later , Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathies for the victims ' families and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua .	-3.4049
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will no longer happen in the future , " he said .	-2.3445
Security minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historic human rights violations .	-2.4795
But the excuses started almost immediately .	-1.2860
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.5552
Some were in the 90s and early 2000 ’ s .	-2.0693
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that must be passed through ' he said .	-2.8538
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on 5 June and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-2.9399
Instead , " everything is regulated by law " , he said .	-2.9413
Wiranto , which the UN charged for ' crimes against humanity ' , which called for more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua were already resolved , including the Paniai incident .	-3.6996
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with great incredibility .	-3.1273
" I have been four times interviewed in the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.5317
'I am tired ' .	-1.1177
He says that he is still afraid for years later .	-9.9241
" I have fear " , he says .	-1.5362
" I fear being arrested by the military , fear of being shot . "	-2.3851
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.3625
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-1.6546
" After I bury the bodies , the military looked for me , " he says .	-2.4154
The shooting did not stop .	-1.8439
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.2300
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were violated , including children .	-3.1311
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who was drunk when fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-2.6412
Excited villagers protested before the site office of the company .	-2.7226
The police said that villagers were stones to officers responding to it by firing warnings .	-2.9235
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot the quantity and killed one .	-12.9479
" We were so in panic , we fear that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lived near the hospital and witnessed how the injured here was quickly delivered , says TIME .	-4.3239
" I hid my house two days ' .	-1.9390
The Deiyai Parliament has called upon to account the officers involved and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area .	-2.7624
Paniai has always been a disturbance for the Indonesian Government .	-2.0178
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal members of the sea , Moni , Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.0777
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by initiating sporadic attacks and kidnapping of Indonesian soldiers .	-2.9622
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.7714
In response to this , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested in recent years and are arbitrarily customised , under the pretext of ' ensuring national sovereignty ' .	-3.6462
Some never dive again .	-1.5653
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.3851
Poverty reinforces discontent .	-1.1447
The rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.8339
Bread is just as except reach .	-1.6451
People here build everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and vegetables .	-2.4126
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of fresh potatoes .	-15.0735
They retain most of the harvest for the family while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.6214
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.0216
Over time , economic inequalities between the local papua and the new migrants have grown since the opening of new flight routes to the Nabire Airport .	-3.6875
The few jobs in the region typically go to better educated and more prosperous migrants .	-2.5247
Papua rarely have capital or the capabilities needed to make their own businesses competitive .	-14.9751
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money " , says John Gobai , the Chairman of the Treasury Council of Paniai .	-2.9455
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.3683
Moreover , restrictions on reporting international media remain strained .	-2.4557
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for a lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.5507
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowi ’ s promises of election campaign to lift the limitations of reporting in order to promote transparency and development have not been realised .	-4.1285
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists who try to report to Indonesia 's disquiet eastern provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in an explanation .	-3.4272
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papua .	-2.2800
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shootings .	-3.3359
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.4280
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir referred to the accusations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : " In Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there are free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases . "	-3.6902
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.8605
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and affected him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also wanted to participate in the meeting , but wish to remain anonymous .	-4.0410
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua says that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.6691
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the Chairman of the Treasury Council .	-3.2740
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-2.8628
Gobai says that , like other Papua , the Paniai people consider their voice to Jokowi as a " guilt " he has to pay back .	-3.2976
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.0721
Despite the threats and intimidations , families of the Paniai shooter victims executed a final symbolic act of despite the fact that the body of a victim was buried in a site precisely towards the police and the military station .	-5.2463
You know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes .	-2.8893

Fire Capture the Dubai Torch skyscrapers for the second time	-2.6555
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest towers of the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee 79-floored buildings from 337 meters .	-3.5410
It is the second fire that features through the high house in just two years , which is randomly called the torch tower ( Fackel Tower ) .	-4.6733
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.2179
" We slept and we were up with the fire alarm and the writing of people .	-3.5113
We ran the stairs down and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor , " a resident who indicated his name as George , Reuters .	-3.5511
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire fighting at 4.00 a.m. local time ( 00.00 GMT ) deleted fire and cooled the building .	-3.7775
The government said that it is working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-2.8269
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world .	-2.8509
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the majority of the damage came from the clothing , the outside clothing to decoration or isolation .	-3.9698
In Britain , the police said that they believe that the system of disks to isolate and clothing at the London Grenfell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire where about 80 people died .	-4.1192

The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has fallen through at the General Assembly with his great Davis coup .	-2.9605
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis cup individuals only on two profits was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-3.7243
They are often very long , but also very esteemed five sentence classics remain preserved for tradition .	-5.5981
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of the reform , the aim of ITF President David Haggerty was therefore just shortly missed .	-3.5851
" We respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our members have not adopted the whole package of reform for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.7235
We need a change to secure the long-term future of this iconic and historical competition , " said Haggerty .	-2.5564
We will continue to work to improve the applications .	-2.2082
Not until the vote , after many objections , the proposal had already come to take the final in a neutral place .	-5.3003

More than 1 out of 5 US travellers brings forbidden items to the aircraft , finds a survey	-3.4014
A passenger survey showed that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously forbidden items were smuggled over the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 % that entered the aircraft while they were accidentally banned knives or other items with sounds .	-5.5150
Less than 1 % claimed that they had delayed that they were mistakenly travelled with weapons , ammunition or explosive .	-3.8281
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers were more likely to disregard the rules .	-3.9026
Of the surveys who admitted that they had knowledgeably tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % Millennial , compared with less than 15 % , which was members of the generation X .	-4.1800
The most common items on TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.7015
More than 3 % were admitted to knowingly subject to sounds through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male surveys also confirmed that they had intentionally banned drugs into the aircraft .	-4.7220
The company said that it was questioning travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods had brought through airport safety and how many would have done it deliberately .	-4.3660
It is no surprise that the people who have the most frequent smuggling goods - knowledgeable or unknown - were those who fly most frequentof ! , !!!!!!!!!!!!	-13.2461
The company , however , points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-18.5555
People are often uncertain what liquids they can take , or how much of them .	-2.7780
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids prohibited by the TSA are prohibited .	-2.7997
For a while , people thought that the TSA could view books as smuggling goods .	-2.7086
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-11.3253
Elon Musk is no matter : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders	-2.3735
Elektro-Thousand Sassa Elon Musk will be happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.6739
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation   a a a a  a a a a a a  a	-15.1632
In addition to the constantly triumphant numbers of revenue and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla chief Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed a different , less glossy number : the cancellations of the new mass market model 3 .	-5.0603
Musk often acquired more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car over the past few months , whose extradition just begins .	-3.7831
Musk now acknowledges : Of the 518,000 preliminary orders , 63,000 have been withdrawn again .	-3.4293
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that they are merely non-binding reservations .	-2.3338
In case of cancellation , Tesla pays the EUR 1000 ( US $ 1000 in the US and UK 1000 pounds ) " Reservation Payment " completely back .	-4.5408
455,000 such non-binding reservations are currently available , Musk received a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.3662
However , the Tesla Chief does not believe that the cancellation of around twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .	-3.6606
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but on the production side .	-2.3184
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.5574
In 2018 , all models will be 500,000 , 2020 million .	-2.6697
The demand for this is obviously there .	-1.9773
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are currently made per day .	-2.1746
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " today may expect the extradition at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production streets , which are never tested in practice , without maximum interstrexexstrexexexexexexouexexexiiexexexI ieviieves !!!!!	-21.3468
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.1711
If there are more delays , then the non-binding of reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-3.9746
For then , the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running in droves .	-3.5460
EPA leader Pruitt is withdrawing from the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions	-3.1927
One day after he was sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the leader of the Environment Protection Agency , took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog caused air pollutants .	-4.0775
Pruitt presented change when his agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities more responsible than previous administrations .	-3.3886
He did not mention the complaint that had been made against his previous site in a Federal Appeal Court .	-3.3473
It is a matter of a deadline for states on 1 October to comply with the 2015 standards for ground-locking ozone .	-4.0026
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time , study the plan and avoid involving ' in local decisions or hinder economic growth ' .	-3.5057
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rulenlesenvilemeenvienvi!! ! !	-12.4862
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly passed over to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuels industry oppose .	-14.4286
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal back for the pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.8957
Last month , a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , oil and gas companies committed to monitoring and reducing methanlecks .	-3.0071
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his turn in ozone standards simply strengthen the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of fulfilling the new standards in time .	-3.9141
" Under previous administrations , the EPA has often failed to comply with the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA for more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.4907
" We do not believe in regulation by trial and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.1923
We also take the law and authority that exists to us seriously ' .	-1.9816
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that , at some point , Pruitt will use its ' power to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are based on solid policies and the best available information ' .	-4.2376
Congress Republicans are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone rules .	-2.6750
A draft legislation approved last month is to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.3804
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.5561
The New York General Public Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.3597
" The reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities " said Schneiderman .	-3.8242
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-2.3069

Representatives of public health systems and environmentalists were surprising changes in prudence .	-4.0119
" It is worrying how much pressure it needs to take this sensible step by those responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity .	-15.0995

Approval of wind wheels	-1.6751
" Boisheim resists " sees no legal condition for construction and has therefore addressed the country council .	-4.2134
The Boisheim Association has resisted Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to take back its permission to establish planned wind power plants in the Boisheim Net .	-4.3385
It was illegal .	-1.7750
The association argues that at the time of authorisation on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheimer Nette , no wind power plants could have been approved , since there was only a window concentration zone at the Schwalmtal border in fourth .	-5.7580
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind energy facilities are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes an exclusion of wind power for the rest of the city .	-4.3748
These zones are to prevent a ' saving ' of the landscape .	-4.1937
The city of Viersen had previously decided a second wind concentration area in the Boisheimer Nette , but the Düsseldorf district government had not approved because of a form error .	-4.7696
" The lack of planning requirement remains the authorisation decision granted unlawful and therefore returns to it , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of Boisheim resists .	-5.5720
Current state of affairs : The town council again decided the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break ; an authorisation of the district government still exists .	-5.2868

The circle takes it as a matter of re-examining the matter .	-3.5106
However , they probably do not cause the procedure to be stopped	-14.4988
With a view to ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not wish to express itself in relation to the argument of the association " Boisheim " .	-4.6418
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , is planning to build four 200 meters high wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.8630
Last year , the company , where the city is involved in fourth , had already signed legal contracts with the owner of the about 65 hectares of large areas .	-5.4517
With the establishment of four wind energy plants , the need for electricity can be covered by around 11 400 households - which meets around a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .	-5.1944
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.3371
Last summer , fourth city council gave a green light for the purchase of three wind power facilities at the Windpark Linnich in Aachen and a participation in a wind energy facility in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the circle of Heinsberg .	-4.9795

With a network , King had said in spring that the lethargy had partially made a let.	-23.2325
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK centre in Mühlhausen announced that five Thuringian cities will participate in the German home shopping day for the first time .	-5.2015

The US President vaccinated him because he had publicly denounced the wall , according to reports he said unto him : ' You cannot tell the press . '	-13.9264
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and swore to pay Mexico for the project .	-2.9556
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.3522
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US that emigrated to Australia would be ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence of trade conveyed by the Obama administration would look like a ' depp ' after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-5.0340

Moores Ford massacre : Activists resume racist lynchact as a call for justice .	-2.8919
A 1948-Ford Mercury wrote a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and bridged on Moore 's Ford bridge .	-13.1460
Before the car that had four black passengers and a white driver reached the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-2.9518
The leader of the mob - a man of middle ages in a needle strip suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked checked through the windscreen .	-3.8781
Inside the people were flooding in fear .	-3.2926

Fortunately , this terrible scene , played on 22 July , is just one night .	-2.7529
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience stood up very true sights .	-14.3920
Since 2005 civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to succeed in the night where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux clan in 1946 .	-4.1275
Nobody was ever charged for murder .	-2.0694
" It is really inconceivable that there was no single person arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organize the delivery .	-4.1291
" It is a dirt spot on a history , but it is a burden for our souls . "	-3.1975
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congress member of the State of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists .	-2.6697
For him , there is a dramatic call for action and an annual memory of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.6568
" We want prosecution , we want the end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we must get justice , " he said .	-2.6836
" We cannot reach cure and reconciliation until we receive justice ' .	-2.0302
A court medicine places a sheet over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynchen on 27 July 1946 .	-4.4038
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.9986
But none has ever been charged .	-9.1495
Although suspects have remained open for decades , civil rights activists say that double motivation for Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .	-3.5800
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision allowed the Black Citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in the pre-election campaign in the summer . of course , the Bof of the of minat  .	-18.9472
Around the same time as the election , after indicating the FBI of the black farmhouse Roger Malcom , Barnett Hester , while fighting , allegedly because of a woman .	-5.3827
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester was sleeping with Malcoms Mrs Dorothy and that the baby she came from her husband was not .	-14.9586
On 25 July 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white land owner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , so the FBI .	-2.6017
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-1.7073
But when they removed from prison and the Moore 's Ford Bridge approached , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.6230
" As it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared and ordered the murders , " it closes an FBI report .	-3.4206
" It is also obvious that there was a complete plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered the identity of witnesses " .	-13.1932
Brooks formulates it even more pronounced .	-2.9449
" It was an electoral right massacre , " he said .	-1.9662
" You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you are registering and voting , then this will happen here . "	-4.1100
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has guided the annual suspension of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde .	-12.7482
Their presentation is illustrative , tangible and is founded in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it does not exist in America anymore .	-4.1056
It is hard to watch and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that is the point .	-13.2143
" We do not want to talk about the lynches because we then face ugly in all of us , " she said .	-3.1657
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or not to hear what I did " .	-2.9881
The samples for this year ’ s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen white and the rest black – were pushing into a room and walking when Greene launched a well-inserted overview of the piece .	-4.7906
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co director .	-1.2194
He has played the role of the chief clanmen for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-3.3956
" I feel dirty because I am not so bin " , said Marbaugh .	-1.7567
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times . "	-2.7324
On the other hand , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , playing Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.6710
The piece begins with Malcom , who attacks and pushes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.3273
" I said n -- he , disappears from my property ! "	-1.8438
Rascona returns the fire .	-1.6557
There is one break .	-1.4259
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in scores .	-2.7682
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.6455
" What ? " , Rascona asked .	-1.1654
It is alarmed and confused .	-1.0231
Was I too hard ?	-0.6730
" No , " Greene said , still kicky .	-1.9835
" I simply do not believe that white people said ' n -- he ' at that time .	-2.6267
" But " , one of the other black manufacturers wrack a a !!!!!!!!!	-11.2917
" You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-1.7238
And that is exactly where energy is shifting in the room , a sense of camera replaces the unease .	-3.4196
Everyone is concerned with getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .	-3.0662
The scene begins again .	-1.3596
This time , when Rascona says the N-word , he says it strongly and emphatically .	-2.8044
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.4458
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-1.9484
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.7103
A woman dressed with a sadness dress stands over the bodies of the actor and executes Billie Holidays trustworthy lobbre " Strange Fruit " .	-12.8573
Their voice breaks at any second word .	-2.2650
Around a hundred meters behind this , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears come to an eye .	-4.3203
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.6605
A couple is made of Ithaca , New York , traveling to see the performance , many come only down the road .	-3.6835
They have experienced almost eight hours of Georgia ’ s humidity when Brooks leads them to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage trip .	-3.9573
Until this point , the killings remained an anecdote , but now , if you stand on the same country where the lynch murders took place , the air feels spensored .	-4.0302
When the last notes of the song go out , Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body name .	-3.3895
Children light on their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent body and flush each other .	-3.5206
" They are not really dead " , murmels a little boy as if he wants to remember it .	-2.9087
After a few minutes , thanks to Greene the quantity - and suddenly it is over .	-2.6821
The actors throw the lynchail away and remove their tears .	-3.3438
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in suit who has played the clanmember .	-15.0263

You did so for one reason . '	-1.7976

At a table , a white couple of Atlanta suggests the delivery with a black couple that they have just met .	-4.1576
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words which feeling left the performance .	-2.5224
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you , " she said .	-3.0130
" What that really does with me , let me believe that the lynches continue , " she added , " today only police shooting is called . "	-3.8567
In the same room , Tyrone keeps Brook ’ s Hof on his table , eating and reminding him of civil rights .	-3.6645
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .	-2.2387

Inquiry comes from St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hoheiße and Sieber .	-3.2384
The information on the table is to be complemented by the Internet .	-3.3156
Therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting locations .	-3.6420
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-12.2274
Later the Star Path train will be extended to train .	-3.9668
" On the star path , the viewers explained a great deal of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " the association declared .	-4.5600
Moreover , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star had a stronger light than another , even though it was much further away .	-4.4707

Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Triple chain works better '	-1.5810
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 for the season stop against Braunschweig that the optimization of defense formation will bring in aue points .	-4.3185
With the first season game , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there would not have been the two opposites at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-3.8138
" These were two opposites too much , and we must carefully in Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defense player .	-3.6957
The triple chain is to be optimized in the arch-mountains .	-4.0801
And a gate after a deadline the fortunes no longer want to catch .	-3.5735
" For the future it will be like no more than Michael ( Rensing ) poses the line . "	-3.8602
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to prepare with the tripartite chain even after the experience .	-4.5742
" I do not know how we will act " , says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , " because we have in the three chain on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well " , Hoffmann said .	-4.3787
" What is required , but that we do even better harmonise and we do not do so many errors in the construction process . "	-5.8544
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.4974
" Whether you can speak of a failed start after a decision , do not know .	-3.1219
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-2.1271
" If we stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the pocal , we will certainly be able to speak of an ordinary season stage . "	-4.6778
His trainer did not want to know anything about this .	-2.2467
" I judge the launch into the season only after six to eight days of playing , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be broken prematurely because of a weather .	-4.7140
" Now you can start the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that players from Aue might even be somewhat fresh because they do not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bone .	-5.0561
" But they do not know that 100 % where they stand at the moment , " says the interior defender of the Fortuna .	-3.2329
Although guests from the Rhineland go as a light favorite on Sunday in the meeting at last ( almost ) finished by Aue .	-4.0607
" That we sweep them away only because we have the right to come under the first six is blödsenn , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is quite positive against eye from nine games .	-14.4961
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which must be beaten from the outset , " says Fortunas Chefcoach .	-4.1297
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and excessive ' .	-3.3696
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday .	-2.2912
Published new results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests	-2.1993
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , subject to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the tested persons are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.2298
The Swedish Forensian Medical Authority ( Rattsmedicinal Medicinal Verket ) began to carry out tests last year .	-13.8806
During the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of age more precisely after the Swedish migration authority ( migration sales ) has been criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-4.9902
To date , migration verket 6.880 has sent testing cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2.481 tests from the middle of March to 31st July 2017 .	-3.8012
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) was judged as 18 or older , while in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was " perhaps 18 years old " .	-3.2087
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is " perhaps under the age of 18 " .	-2.0463
The tests are only performed in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-2.3250
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.6059
" We see no major difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are quite constant , " he said The Local magazine .	-2.6854
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-2.9469
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that ' propose that the investigated person is 18 years old or older ' .	-2.9003
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published , she found that in 243 these cases , the person had frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-2.9891
The method of medical evaluation , in which X-ray pictures of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-4.5860
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they were usually through puberty sooner or at a lat at a l .	-12.2649
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.3606
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.3220
If we cannot say it certainly , we should not act as if we could " , he said the newspaper metro .	-3.1463
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child as an adult is low .	-3.5983
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case , that is roughly 10 % ' .	-3.5311

The work on the three bridges of the country road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.8919
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes of serious concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.9189

This is a peripheral attachment , which is also used as a path of operation .	-3.2841
In the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meters wide bridge cap will be used on Friday .	-3.2066
That is what the pedestrian path should be .	-12.3339
This is particularly because these are finished parts , a patent from the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-3.6665
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-1.9607
The publishing of lines by the building in Lauterbach requires special fingertips .	-3.8028
There is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected to .	-3.8208
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the work by hand papers .	-14.1484
Furthermore , fish and cancer had to be fished first !	-11.5444
For the bridges between the Bauhofbauhofbaude and the Collector wine in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-4.7696
For the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbacher local entrance , the street in the area of the bridge is fully blocked at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " .	-13.6388
The cost of the three bridges together is EUR 700 000 .	-14.1356

He said that he is sorry for " all athletes who have been snapped away from competitions in gold and silver medals " .	-3.8438
Despite its comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found references to state-funded doping in Russia .	-3.1554
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe the reporters .	-2.1525

The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried alongside his wife after his death .	-2.8970
That said the king hall on Thursday .	-2.8225
Traditionally , the Danish royal pair is placed in the Domkirche of Roskilde .	-3.3809

Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is still unclear .	-1.9473
But he does not intend to contribute to his French home .	-2.8717
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of not happy with his title .	-2.3806

He likes the country for which he has worked in the last 50 years .	-2.0042

Prime Minister Weil Wants New Election	-1.5544
CDU and FDP in Lower Saxony	-1.8510
Lower-Saxon Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the red-green government majority loss , has resigned for a rapid re-election of the country 's day , he does not want to resign .	-5.0226
Because it spoke on Friday for Parliament 's disban becununa !!!!!!!!	-13.0120
Previously , the surprising exit of a Green Member from her country group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .	-3.9527
Five months before the official date of the rural election , the red green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce single vote in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-15.2456
The previous Green MEP , Elke Twesten , established her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wüm ) .	-4.4396
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she said on Friday in Hanover .	-1.9034
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to include them .	-2.5200
Thus , CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxon country day , SPD and  Gre , and 6        a  a a  !	-17.2675
So far , the ratio has been the opposite .	-2.5926
The new landdday will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-2.2299
Thümler said that the red green government should now decide whether to govern in this situation without a majority .	-2.2801
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day decides as quickly as possible to resolve its self-resolution .	-4.1564
The CDU Group will likely decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.5401
The national constitution also provides for the country ’ s ability to withdraw confidence from the Prime Minister and elect a successor .	-3.5662
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.4105
These opportunities must be examined clean legally , " said Thümler .	-2.8510
" You will be discussing all questions in calm when they are legally reasonable . "	-3.9594
Thümler called Twesten 's move " somewhat curious " .	-2.7472
The politician himself stressed : ' I am not a traitor .	-1.8272
I feel very good ' .	-1.3565
It was a supporter of Black Green .	-2.3370
The Greens asked the disappointing Members to return their mandate .	-3.1266
" Of course , we assume that she returns her mandate to the green national list with immediate effect " , the national chairman Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner told her that she was given her mandate .	-5.7412
The Green Group chairman Anja Piel said : ' We regret the decision by Elke Twesten extraordinarily ' .	-3.0969
It has deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-2.4834
" Even against the background that there were no substantive differences , we cannot understand this step ' .	-3.4939
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transgression of the Netherlands Green Member Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal .	-3.2521
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to the electorate but also betrayal of red green , " the Federal Social Democrats wrote on Friday on Facebook .	-3.6124
He supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly re-elect the land-day .	-15.7510
The exit of Twestens costs the majority of the red green in Lower Saxony .	-3.1622
The politician " place " in their injured vanity and in their frustration their personal interests before the country 's good , " criticised SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.2029
" It is a scandal that the CDU participates in Lower Saxons in this dirty intriggency , trying to beat political capital . "	-11.8500
Lower Saxony CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his Members to include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-2.7866
The Group leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Opermann , proposed that Twesten , with personal career thinking , falsify the result of the 2013 election .	-4.6738

Interview Agriculture Minister - How do we protect ourselves from poisoners , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.6079
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.4819
How could the scandal happen ?	-0.7950
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.1013
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) stands in the interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) speech and response .	-2.8923
Mr Schmidt , how can the consumer protect against poisoned eggs ?	-1.5055
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp pressure .	-2.8988
On the consumer protection portal www.food warning.de , the Federal Governments introduce the latest information on the egg charges affected .	-4.0153
Those eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-16.7157
Even if , as we know , a health threat is practically excluded .	-3.0520
Are Aldi now taking the best possible response - all eggs out of offer - because the central role of the Enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Agriculture Minister ?	-4.0140
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the German states .	-2.4775
Nevertheless , my House has delayed itself immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became known .	-4.2765
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.0179
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are traffic and healthy .	-3.3294
If a maximum of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded on eggs , they are not traffic .	-3.9020
However , unburdened eggs can be sold and consumed .	-1.6319
This time it is not the farms that are to blame .	-2.8984
Are production facilities and consumers in the same boat ?	-2.1518
According to the current level of knowledge , production firms are not directly to blame .	-3.5236
Instead , they must expect economic damage due to illegal practices by service companies .	-2.7561
As always , there are too little controllers in the seriousness .	-2.4392
Is it just a matter of staff or a coherent jurisdiction ?	-3.0028
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process   .	-14.7881
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .	-2.5186
It is precisely for this reason that it is crucial to clarify such events and to hand over to the prosecutors in cases where crimes can be available .	-4.8447
I have already made it quite clear on several occasions that I expect a full information from the responsible authorities .	-3.4536
Is the regular alarm in food scandals really necessary ?	-2.1869
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and traffic food .	-14.0683
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food economy , consumers are rightly indignant .	-2.9267
Producers , traders and consumers have fallen into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-4.2265
The basic principle must be clear : the illegal use of the Fipronil insecticide in the attitude of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be completed immediately .	-3.5680
At all levels , this must be worked consistently and with high-pressure enencres.	-18.3476
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the matter is quickly and fully clarified .	-4.0731
How do football ’ s financial rules affect Neymar ’ s removal to Paris	-3.2464
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from the European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.1842
Some consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-3.3765
Financial Fair Play rules , set up by UEFA in 2011 , mean that PSG must at some point show that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-4.0206
Barcelona paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to purchase the Brazilian from his treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will be $ 10 million a year .	-2.9556
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s removal to France .	-1.9609
PSG can certainly make money easier to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy rich ruler family of Qatar .	-13.9376
Associations may spend a lot of money on acquisition of players , but must control legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to make the Break Even point in their business related to football .	-4.9938
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA president in 2007 .	-1.9275
The former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debt in their search for success were effectively cheating and risking to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.9195
In 2011 , FFP moved from concentration to club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.7502
The change meant that the business model , which Roman Abramovich used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand , should become a tougher issue .	-3.4026
During the current three-year FFP investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.1542
And although Platini fell underground from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor Aleksander Cefer continues to deter excessive expenditure .	-3.5549
" Certainly , FFP is not dead and we will certainly step up the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , responsible for UEFA for FFP , towards The Associated Press last week .	-12.7015
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate , it can distribute the amount for the accounting for the duration of its contract .	-3.9722
Neymar has signed a five-year treaty so that the replacement amount can be expelled at EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts for the next five years .	-3.7700
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , met with the most serious sanctions .	-2.9185
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( at that time $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 remain limited to 21 players rather than the normal 25 players players .	-12.5774
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by blurring their revenue by companies linked to the owners of a club .	-3.6166
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income .	-3.2238
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA ’ s sponsorship was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.6273
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the World Cup 2022 Organization Committee .	-3.3566
But PSG and Qatar 2022 disputed that Neymar World Cup ambassadors will become and that such a manoeuvre could simply be found for UEFA regulators .	-3.3041
Until now , sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observing any attempt to circumvent the rulI have seen a rula   a    the the ununununununun	-19.7995
UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG on Neymar ’ s transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-2.2985
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.3153
The last reports published show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has gained more than EUR 10 million .	-3.0192
The accounts for the last financial year must be published .	-2.2410
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and tricot sales .	-2.6655
The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 % after signing .	-2.2100
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent Neymar ’ s way by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.5216
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish newspaper AS in relation to Katars ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.4355
Arsenal-Manager Arsenal Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sport tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-3.1297
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the whole football landscape over the past 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.8539
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-1.7431
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because different ways can be taken or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.0368

Nostalgie goes to " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " to the Nish	-11.7370
This repetition of history is nostalgic simultaneously because of the glorious days of the 1980s , for the 90-year-old Grunge-era ( when the foremost David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things .	-4.9707
As a cultural artifact , it is equally a parody and a embody of our facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-2.4982
But as a franchise it feels as if time were short .	-2.2773
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking dose vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-2.4769
By auctioning at the heart of the gag - actors of middle ages play horny children who will adult - they still created the impossibility to win the last part of the joke .	-4.6007
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the fun principle , including a reef on the stalker films of the 1990s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that Switches the Cradle " ) .	-5.1222
At one point , a character raises through an Apple powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.3410
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.0022
The loving coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now Romanauthor , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.4275
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his virgin virgin .	-2.0166
And there is another crazy malicious plot , included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-13.0255
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.8138
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillon sub-lipper of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old cracker .	-4.4812
It is the moments of random madness that this franchise could fuel like a kind of repeated " Seven Up ! " series until he achieves what I consider to be his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the bands how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.9141
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon now reminds us of another type of nostalgia : the revitalisation of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-west ring campaign iconography .	-3.8410
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as as a director indicates being a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest , who are fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism .	-3.8873
The main roles - a hard sotted gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-3.5009
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.2553
But it is not much more than one idea .	-1.4399
There are some beautiful gags to repute ( the police spend the time seeing chess on television , as Americans perhaps do with football ) .	-3.7003
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershhala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - provides a decent game of ' Find out the voice ' .	-11.2135
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it is often played like a single one .	-3.5036
There are six long episodes , and comedy is not fast or often enough .	-2.6741
" Comrade Detective " , which was directed to a lesser length , could provide its Agitprop-Satire better , as Gregor and Iosef always visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who worsen a heap of Hamburger .	-13.5072

Complaining large gaps in the foreign register	-2.6643
'Data from citizens who should not appear there ' : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-3.2409
This leads to partly serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-2.7439
The representative for the Federal Government ’ s refugee management , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to a media report to large gaps in the foreign central register .	-3.6257
Defects in the data registered there may lead to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures and deportations , warning in an analysis presented by the " South German newspaper " .	-4.4945
According to the register , ten million people are collected with foreign nationality , including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-2.8389
The data will therefore be managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-1.9681
Because the data have not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of data has not been good in parts so far .	-3.3716
In individual cases , data had been found in 1921 , " people who are long no longer alive , or citizens who have become German citizens and who should actually no longer appear in the register	-13.9750
The report continues to say that failures can slow return processes considerably .	-4.8488
In the statistics on travelling people , moreover , EU citizens are covered that do not need to travel .	-4.5748
Such false assignments , however , led to ' a distorted debate about how to deal with exit obligations ' , it therefore says in the analysis .	-4.9290
Meanwhile , the Federal Government appears to have begun to send refugee families with under 16-year-old children back to Italy when they entered there .	-3.5019
This emerges from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " reports .	-2.7023
The paper therefore says that BAMF has been carrying out such procedures ' concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-4.4139

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2899
The Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and weakening inflation have reduced speculation over a rise .	-3.4569
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain ' bear ' when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in a stronger pressure .	-3.5639
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ’ s policymakers ( MPC ) voted in favour of keeping interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members striving for this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.0523
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % , and in 2018 to 1.6 % , warning that budgetary income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in autumn .	-15.0597
But it signaled that in the next few years interest rates would be needed to reinstate Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , and she said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.2575
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.3679
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the system - with 115 billion pounds sterling .	-3.9295
Minutes following the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the central prognosis of the MPC , GDP remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption . '	-4.2056
As regards interest rates , it repeated that ' a certain streamlining of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' somewhat larger ' scale than markets expect .	-3.7867
Markets are currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-1.9239
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradually ' and ' limited ' .	-2.2192
The Bank ’ s growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % projected in May and 1.7 % .	-2.6426
It retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.7153
The pound fell after these news towards the dollar and the euro .	-1.7459
The pound fell from 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , and fell 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .	-2.6601
The decision no change is taking place after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an interest rate increase , and 0.2 % GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-4.6951
Growth is likely to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will easily recover at the end of the year after the bank .	-14.5447
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small salary increases , because the tightening will get worse first before it will improve .	-4.5704
She added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent the income decline in the next few years ' , but she added that wages will recover ' clearly ' at the end of their three-year forecasts .	-4.0879
The economy is also reinforced by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate some of the lower consumer spending .	-2.9512
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-3.2035
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve full prices and the economy .	-2.4995
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the reputation for an increase in interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.3142
Inflation has dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , despite the fact that the Bank said that this was expected and that it would recover in the coming months .	-3.5971

NHS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescribe controversial HIV drugs to 10,000 people	-2.2140
From September , patients will receive access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment before the high court against the financing of the medicine in NHS .	-4.1830
NHS England announced that a preexposure prophylax ( PrEP ) taken before gender transport , which can reduce the risk of infection among high-risk opatients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-4.3508
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s appeal court confirmed a judgment by the Supreme Court of Justice that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP , despite claiming that local authorities should finance it .	-3.6355
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-3.4571
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to enable people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-2.9714
Preexposure prophylaxes ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before the sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.7166
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the transfer of HIV to infectionists .	-2.5997
To take PrEP before sexual traffic means that there are enough drugs in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-2.9044
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before gender traffic .	-16.9830
Those who call into question the treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.0198
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment .	-2.9646
People living in England and registered with a doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local participating sexual clinic .	-3.2227
The program will sign <unk> 10 million and NHS England a contract for the supply of medicines this week after international competitive procurement .	-13.2230
The study is intended to judge the whole potential of PrEP by collecting clinical proof as targeted , recorded and implemented in a large scale .	-4.5023
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.4233
It is another milestone in the progress that continues over three decades in managing one of the greatest humanity health challenges . '	-3.6280
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.9434
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-2.9495
From September , people with a high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled , not subject to a negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .	-4.1348
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.1688
Ian Green , CEO of Terrence Higgin Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV will be left behind .	-3.9166
Now that PrEP test medicine has been sourced , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-2.5207
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow-Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .  !  !	-9.3660
The evidence shows how transformative these drugs can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life-changing infection .	-2.7338
This attempt will bring us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-1.9460
Now it is important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected by HIV and that it will help to ensure that we move closer to the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.3200
The great life : Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned these small Earls Court apartments into a spacious home	-3.0959
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , smalled from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-2.2912
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-13.0268
" Before that , I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne  .	-15.1060
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-1.6107
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.2263
I loved them and made an offer this day ' .	-2.7894
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet has been completely outdated .	-2.7823
Originally a single room property with a nestled layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an intermediate floor to optimally use the generous ceiling height .  !   !!!!!!!!!!!!!	-13.8061
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .	-2.0582
That was my requirement , ' she says .	-1.7258
For this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill , who used 12.5 feet high ceilings and created a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.1758
The ceiling was not big enough to place two spaces together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .	-3.5944
He had to think creatively in order to solve the targets .	-12.5950
" The steel work is quite complicated " , he explains .	-2.1106
" We had to arrange the premises in such a way that they were stacked together without having to bridge us .	-3.6960
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel in such a way that he had the right height for the function upwards or downwards . '	-11.1379
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full altitude - with much more additional drama .	-14.6633
For the intermediate floor there is a classic copper light window of Retrouvius over the glamorous living area downhill .	-4.1339
Reflected gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.4834
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.4940
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends in order to allow him to work lon . everything at all time!	-16.8302
The kitchen feels like a window in a different room .	-2.2448
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all bricks and glasses of Joanne .	-2.6399
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-2.8937
There is nothing new about meeting cuisine .	-3.7289
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.6245
" A bit of engineering went into it , " explains Erfan from the steel reinforced MDF door .	-3.4369
" It is weighty , so it is very light when you put the door on . "	-5.1549
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Joanne has gained an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.2501
" At the end of the day you will sell the area - or how your property is estimated - says Erfan .	-2.5289
" In a rudimentary form a property broker will enter and calculate a calculation based on ground size " .	-3.5298
They have managed to increase the ground area while at the same time using high-quality materials that give space its luxurious advantage .	-4.0068
" The materials are the things you touch and which help to create an emotional binding in a home " says Erfan .	-3.1361
" You don 't love them in the walls .	-2.9412
These are important , but they do not play with your heart ' .	-2.0565
It shows that an apartment can be turned by good design and increased square meter number of slightly default into something quite amazing .	-4.3410
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.1669
Brothers struggle for a $ 500 million real estate empire	-2.5249
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty in a confrontation because of one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate emperors worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.2861
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business is to be divided .	-3.8355
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-3.3605
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-2.5467
There the family Westco Jeans founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.9663
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.3057
This money was invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburb city .	-3.5687
Following an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " main operator and dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - has about two thirds of corporate assets and Paul for about a third .	-4.6335
A court act is that it means that Colin owned property worth $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.3466
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.1026
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-3.2264
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.3260
The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - Colin , as Paul claims , excluded him .	-3.4861
Colin argues that this is not true , but rather throws Paul to manage some possessions incompetent .      .	-18.3448
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-1.9292
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.1054
The costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and lawyers held by both sides .	-3.7747
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicate business from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies .	-3.5239
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property , in which Colin opened the first Jeanslades of the family .	-3.1449
Colin says that he began Westco when he was " in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( approximately 10 years old ) . "	-3.2848
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons .	-2.4135
" Luigi often said unto me that he never wanted the brothers to land to court , " she wrote .	-2.2122
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , claiming Colin that $ 10 million and $ 26 million were paid when the company left .	-3.4232
Both Lukas and Mark say , Paul said , " bittered about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-3.6490
Colin was very retreated , although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star .	-4.0432
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.3552
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I can not say much " because the case was before the courts .	-2.8894
" It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.3592
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.4985
" Our father did not want Paul and I ended up in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-2.7303
On Friday , this hope seemed to be over .	-1.6022
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.0797
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.0179
Others tried and failed .	-0.9449
Perhaps John F. Kelly could do so .	-12.0664
If so , it will be the first .	-0.9635
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including the reports of the news media , in the hope of keeping the head on a more even-handed course .	-3.7744
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.1218
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House chief of staff met with leading employees at his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that falls into the hands of the president .	-4.3289
Kelly said to employees that information about him should be flown - whether on paper or in Briefings - because the president would make better choices if he were to receive good information ' .	-3.4563
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media .	-1.5129
President Trump ’ s relationship with television is enough decades - and now where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.9870
" If Trump was angry because of unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs that were to be convinced , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said in February against Politico .	-4.3535
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s twitter habit under control , according to six former electoral campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption involves a steady praise . "	-3.4237
Okay .	-1.1494
But the idea that Trump ’ s twitter habit ever was " under control " is ridiculous .	-1.6120
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that without their interventions , Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more ignition .	-3.0987
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-1.9041
If his employees have managed to keep trouble from him for some time , then their efforts have been worthwhile . even succsuin !! ! !! ! !!you !!!!!!!m	-20.4334
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.5225
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-3.7153
Politico - wholeheartedly employed this story - reported in May on the preference of consultants to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons .	-3.8661
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.3960
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is aware of where they come from .	-3.9018
This is precisely what happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president of maliciously a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a pile " in the White House .	-10.8289
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter because of harassment , or that he has not offered any concrete evidence , or that he has expressed false charges and revoked them in the past .	-4.1496
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh . "     a a !a !a !!!	-10.8313
Goldmacher added that the then chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper scram " .	-3.4524
How did this go ?	-1.7520
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .	-9.3330
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective managers than priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still striving for influence .	-3.2024
Kelly ’ s mission is extremely difficult to make these unchanged factors .	-3.7073

Travellers negotiate a dig and return to the ' millionaire series '	-2.3826
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travellers on war foot , who have negotiated a ditch drawn by the municipality to call for a field to their manor houses .	-5.2961
The travelers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , called the " millionaires series " .	-3.3631
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters only after they were thrown out in May , but without having been discouraged by a ditch excavated by the Council to prevent their incidents .	-4.8186
The tactful group found a gap in defense plants and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-3.1912
Inhabitants have affected the Solihull Council , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-3.9331
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they thrown stones to the passengers .	-3.6336
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.3624
The travellers were there in May and were moved and are back now .	-3.4355
Yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.1010
She added : " The advice of Birmingham knows how to deal with it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks .	-2.8928
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my municipal tax if the Council cannot stop it even . '	-3.3543

The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , located in Bad Bergzabern , has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it again a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-4.5594
The group has four houses with the pleasant town object .	-2.2675
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.1180
They are called Hotel Luise , Luise Park , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.8770
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and if you enter the hotel , it is clear what extensive renovation work is done .	-5.5940
The soils were torn out , ceilings partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-3.9539
The entire hotel is a single construction site .	-1.9769
There is much to be done until March .	-1.9433

Russia ’ s Special Investigators	-2.0969
In the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump , special investigators Robert Mueller should have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-3.4249
In recent weeks , the body has taken up the work , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " , appointed to the cause .	-6.2150
The newspaper regarded the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations .	-2.3875
The CNN broadcaster reported that there are already first invitations from the board in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.4989
US secret services have long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaig .	-3.2149
Mueller is examining whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-11.0941
The focus of the investigations should be several men acting in the election campaign as Republican adviser .	-3.8114
According to reports , Mueller took more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.6908
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the Trump special investigator personally came to the heart and investigate whether the president might have hampered the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-5.4131
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and decide whether charges are to be madasterased . asasasasasas .	-22.0808
Grand Jurys are therefore called charges .	-2.4805
They are usually turned on when they are more and more controversial cases .	-3.4939

The body can also be enabled by the Public Prosecutor in order to invite people to accept theunder under oasis assumed the Public of Prominence assoof the .	-18.9892

People who were involved in the meeting were asked to say that it was stated in the report .	-3.2175
They should also provide documents .	-0.9075
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s consultants and Schwiegerson , Jared Kushner , and his then-campaign leader Paul Manafort , took part in t  .	-5.5350
Legal experts said on Thursday evening in US television that the setting shows that Mueller does not let himself be intimidated and that , if necessary , he wants to act quickly .	-4.4809
But it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned off at the end to decide on charges .	-4.1037
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body of beginning a new phase in the studies and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-12.6981
In the midst of new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.1114
" The Russian history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.7870
The subject gives Democrats an opportunity to " feel good " because they have nothing else they can talk about " .	-3.2654
His special advisor Ty Cobb declared in an opinion that he knows nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.1592
But he usually works in secret , he emphasised .	-3.6920
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the special determiner in a " fair " way .	-2.9718
The former FBI leader , James Comey , said three times that it would not be identified against the President .	-14.8721
There is no reason to assume that something has changed , it has been said in the declaration .	-3.9767
Mueller had only been used after Trump had fired Comey .	-2.3775
Because of this dismissal , accusations against Trump have become loud , he wanted to hinder the judiciary .	-4.1009
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop the investigations against the national security adviser Michael Flynn at that time .	-3.5492
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.1688
After presenting US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his employees .	-3.8167
The speculation triggered above whether Trump wants to release Mueller .	-3.2020
Unlike an independent Congress special investigator , such as the Watergate affair for the later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Department of Justice at pressure from the President .	-4.0084
But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step .	-2.1984
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented legislation on Thursday that special investigators could no longer be released .	-3.7547
Antarctic : Gigantic Iceberg Drives in the AnAnt!!	-8.6298
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has resolved from Berlin 's almost seven times .	-4.0693
This included the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-12.4130
Over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of large colours now drive to the north and will probably need two , three years until it is melted .	-4.9327
It is length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice gigants registered in the last three decades .	-4.0411
He is not at risk for people .	-2.2019
To what extent climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg , research information is unclear .	-3.1760
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for around 30 years , the US Research Centre for Snow and Eis ( NSIDC ) writes in a fact background .	-3.5320
According to many researchers , global warming could link this to ! univer! !	-13.0420
The now aborted coloss has been part of the Larsen-C Schelfeis .	-3.7317
Schelfeis swimming on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.1065
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly departs .	-3.8321
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-2.9625
North of this front was the balance of growth and cancellation a few years ago .	-3.1637
A complete celebration was disintegrated there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.0566
There is much to say that the Larsen-C shellfire is in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn itself as much as it is now . any !!!!!!!!!!!!!	-13.4868
In addition , the ice-plate is under tension and can fall if a key place cancels a piece .	-5.5924
The melting of Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea levels , since they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it does after the melting itself .	-4.8296
However , the loss of the rock leads to the fact that glaciers can leave directly into the sea and much faster than before .	-4.6635
This could possibly increase the sea level , but only slightly , write the British research project to observe the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-3.3994
The Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth largest Antarctic feel according to AWI data with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.3278
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-3.6674
There it regularly departs .	-2.4034
" Although it is a natural event and we do not know any direct connection with climate change , the ice shield comes into a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary from the British Swansea University .	-4.4717
" This is the most withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.7324
Among scientists , whether the Larsen-C shellfish will grow again or , in the long run , possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.3561
But this development will last for decades .	-1.6348
Even though these researchers do not cause climate change to break down this massive iceberg , there has been a great deal of ice cells in the Antarctic Peninsula over the past decades .	-5.7271
This long tip of the Antarctic covers South America .	-2.7532
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-2.8804
The increase in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-2.4669
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years , including the areas where temperature rises fastest .	-3.8769
CDU wants house prices for staff	-3.5101

More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circle management in Mettmann  .	-9.2229
Now 17 trainees have their first working day behind themselves .	-2.7162
The circle teachings are apparently very sought .	-3.1167
Around 620 applications have been recorded for the places to be given this year .	-2.7371
Nevertheless , the circle continues to lack staff to deal with the increased requirements and tasks .	-3.1906
At the moment there are still 50 unoccupied positions with Mettmann circle .	-3.5105
Among other things , doctors and engineers , as well as forces of general administration , are being a a a !	-11.1814
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UEC , wants to take the initiative in conjunction with the shortage of professionals in administration in the circle .	-5.2601
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration should develop a concept for human resources and human development .	-4.4253
The objective is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals but to counter the shortage of applicants in the future , it says .	-4.0569
The overall concept should be based on internal and external actions , demonstrate concrete measures for cross-entering and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-5.2757
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.2775
Because the circle has to do with personal problems that were not known earlier .	-3.7331
Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-1.8578
The speech is about a genuine " competition of public employers " .	-3.3703
In addition , a large number of employees who depart from the service from disease or ageing requirements .	-4.5850
So maximum time to act , so that not more jobs remain unoccupied .	-3.8400
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples , leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-2.7573
He recently caused a thick surprise in the circle when he publicly questioned the cover of personnel and blunt the other parties .	-4.8163
People want to be reviewed all possibilities that allow local employers ' associations to leave .	-3.7816
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the circle management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with cities - should aim for a tariff of people , " said people .	-5.5158
Thus , the CDU is trying to better pay employees and officials than actually providing for collective bargaining for the public service .	-14.6035
The salaries are currently precisely stipulated , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is based on professional years .	-4.5028
But the role of the circle has grown in recent years .	-2.2270
Just a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be established where employees are concerned about the provisions of the new Prostitutional Protection Act .	-3.9712
Not least by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .	-3.0438
Italy exacerbates the tone to NGO migrant bailouts	-2.8063
Italy has warned that if it does not adhere to new rules for its operations , Italy has warned NGOs that bailouts for migrants in the Mediterranean .	-4.0715
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working " , Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turino daily newspaper La Stampa .	-3.1607
Minniti ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German Youth Saving Agency , because their team had worked effectively with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-3.4549
The aid organisation , which has only been operating for one year , refused to express itself at detailed accusations of the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.4864
" For us , saving human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone at the moment , " said the organisation in an opinion on social media .	-3.3073
" We can judge all the accusations that are currently being made only after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation . "	-3.6982
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Saving ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.7972
It is suspected that his occupation takes hose boat migrants , who are supplied directly by human traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again .	-4.3457
At least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Public Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-2.9615
The occupation is suspected of monitoring itself over the authority of the Italian coastguard , rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-3.1475
Under the code of conduct , boats like the Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board that monitors their activities .	-2.6697
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have been prepared to keep to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.4824
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring ' essential changes or disabilities ' to their rescue actions .	-12.2234
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize winner organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.5120
Minniti meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived after Italy ’ s rescue measures has fallen sharply over recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.6135
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the minister said .	-2.3736
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-3.3254

Console instead of lawns - Federal League equipped for E-Sport	-3.5741

With prominent e-sportsmen under the Treaty , online may be far more present in these markets than just once a year sending the Federal Liga Team to Asia .	-4.2467
What is at stake here ?	-1.7940
Computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or the FIFA football simulation are brought up at competitive level .	-3.6634
Leagues , like normal sport , have long established leagues where professionals are taking action against each other .	-3.8945
E-Sport is already part of the official programme at the 2022 Asian Games .	-2.4781
But is it a real sport ?	-2.5361
For many , the idea is certainly useful .	-1.9607
Ingo Froböse has also long dealt with the issue .	-2.6939
E-Sport is a sport for the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne because he is competitive and shows many biological and physical responses that can also be found in classical sport - for example increased heart frequencies , stress responses , hormonal changes .	-4.0625
It also requires cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and quick response .	-2.6912
Professional gamers should train not only at the console , but also their bodies and respect the diet .	-3.2852
" The fitte player is a good player " .	-1.6833
Froböse also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a theme " .	-2.8268
Controls were difficult to work with online games , and in the scene the structures of classical sport were lacking .	-15.2034
The scientists highlight the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-2.9631
Players are on the road internationally , that is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.3666

Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn .	-2.0229
There is also much to be done in Europe .	-2.2519
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a teaching compartment , Froböse says .	-3.2767
In the Netherlands and France , the Football Erstliga clubs are now obliged , according to Dutt , to set up an e-sport department .	-3.3983
" In the European comparison , Germany lags behind , " explains VfB board Röttgermann .	-3.2747

Michelle Carter condemns suicide because of the texts that Conrad Roy pushes to suici	-13.7398
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide by texts and calls .	-2.4071
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars , and five years have been subjected to profit .	-3.7057
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took the life on 13 July 2014 .	-2.4572
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is untreasurable .	-2.2896
My son was my best friend . '	-1.2024
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .	-2.5706
It was faced with a maximum punishment of 20 years , but its legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental disease .	-2.9924
Carter dressed in red trousers and a cream coloured blouse with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when condemned .	-4.6556
" Their actions have killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor said to the court .	-2.5027
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-1.6739
She did not take responsibility ' , she said .	-2.1462
" She has shown no repentance " .	-2.7357
But Carter ’ s lawyer said that it was a ' terrible circumstance that she totally regrets ' .	-2.7231
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not discover that her " age or maturity , or even her mind , have a significant impact on her actions " .	-3.7397
A prosecutor reads a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy , who said that ' there is no day when I do not regret the loss of my beloved son .	-3.4666
I want it to be proud of me and how I deal with everything , despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity , to be there for its sisters , " it says .	-4.8148
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an assault for his children .	-4.2717
" No longer have this only person to have with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life " she said .	-3.7774
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-3.2642
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found in 2014 dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-2.4781
The case drew national attention after Carter ’ s text communications revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.3528
" If you hang up , jump from a building , first you yourself , I do not know there are many ways " , she said in several messages she had sent her in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.3911
At the moment before his suicide she wrote : " You have to do it , Conrad " and " Everything you have to do is switch off the generator and you will be free and happy " .	-3.7442
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and arranged that she should benefit from the case by some press .	-3.1188

But , of course , as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , he was not a Philipp Lahm , nor a Manuel Neuer , he made the binds allocated to him to the arm .	-5.5286
" The trainer did not announce it , " the Confed-Cup winner told , after his first commitment as a Bavarian captain .	-3.5454
Good , the deposit could have been better running than at 0.2 against the SSC Naples .	-12.8767
But the sign of the coach could also indicate Kimmich .	-2.8166
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as the leader of the professionals from the youth players , debutants and existing C-Elf who were just holiday , but rather he .	-6.2760
Suckerl is most favourably distributed to those who want to keep up with laune .	-4.7624
So , if you are exchanging the legacy of Lahm , you can only use a small extra motivation .	-16.4848
Kim confirmed : " That is what you want to accept as a player ' .	-3.7105
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old was a mini-lahm about the field .	-2.9588
To the right , that is its position , the white binds in the arm did their rest .	-3.1636
And even the Kimmich worked in this start-up formation as the one who can best take the help into the ha.	-6.5259
He gave instructions to try to direct the unplayed troop .	-2.8452
He had a look for the whole , while many others were concerned with themselves .	-3.4629
Vidal with playing over his lack of fitness ( hardly any ) ; Renato Sanches come up on devil to follow the services of the Asian trip ( flapped only ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle failed to negatively fall in their first appearance in the Bavarian trikot .	-7.0853
After all , this was a good thing .	-3.1466
Süle ran next to Kimmich , Rudy before defense , both acted sovereign .	-2.4956
The well-occupied Napoli storm has often difficulty , as well as souls tried to succeed in playing for a few times .	-5.0485
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped for it ' .	-3.2436
But he also showed a proper performance at the debut .	-2.3513
Game relocation , tempo change : " For this style I was also hold " .	-4.7377
As unusual , this Bavarian world is still for the new accessions , it followed the partie .	-4.9751
For example , Rudy did not get one or two in the catacombs , but determines six or seven interviews .	-2.7234
Kimmich approved after a few brilliant statements in the back of his new fellow players .	-3.4991
He heard of soul an interesting sentence : " What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-3.7180
At Bavaria you just have to win every game " .	-2.1915

Companies satisfied with Rheinland-pflzig Minister : Economics praises WissinS ’ s Tem!!!! ! ! ! ! ! !	-11.2107
It was often inconsistent , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland Palatinate .	-3.4298
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs is Volker Wissing ( FDP ) in office .	-3.0874
Chambers and businesses from the region speak on TV questions about a change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister .	-3.6106
Frank Natus , chairman of the Association Trierer Company ( VTU ) , says : ' Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked ' .	-3.4431
The biggest turn of the turn is Natus in infrastructure policy : the gap conclusion of the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now high on the country ’ s list of priorities .	-4.5818
This year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure until 2021 the construction of ldesign decision makever .	-20.5341
The country ’ s plans also play a role in the Western circumvention of Trier , which is the primary need for the Federal World Transport Plan .	-4.5318
The goal is to operate the route in December 2020 says Cornelia Holtmann Ministerium speaker .	-3.9678
Natus sees a director to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.1060
The Industrial Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier seeks , as encouraged by Wissing , to increase the sale in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been covering for ten years .	-5.0814
Furthermore , knowledge has an open ear for people who want to create their own company praises the IHK .	-3.4496
The Trier Chamber of Commerce sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.2767
A premium of EUR 1000 for the existing master examination and EUR 2500 if graduates are independent within ten years after master training .	-4.4362
The country 's homework list remains long .	-11.9438
The planned road construction is quick to create facts , while at the same time it lacks the country on the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , main manager of the IHK Trier .	-5.0519
From 56 new engineers who want to set up mobility knowledge when running the country , 29 posts have been filled .	-17.3443
The IHK calls for more orders to be sent to external offices .	-2.1302
CDU Group vice of Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors , investing more than EUR 2017 and 2018 in receiving national roads than proposed .	-3.7755
Frank Natus is also expecting a concept of the country as to remedy the lack of professionals in the region .	-3.7883
It is also sobering that broadband expansion in the country is somethat we have enjoened .	-14.9589

Audi should change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash	-2.1444
One day before Audi announced BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.6991
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than driving limitations ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-4.0979
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-1.6882
None of the companies described businesses as a call .	-2.6480
European car manufacturers have strongly supported the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States in order to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.3678
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.8359
The cost of automotive manufacturers to install plants to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increase , making it difficult to keep cars competitive .	-3.6054
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also prosecuted to mark the powerful car companies and ignore the problem .	-3.5426
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called switching devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested , but returned to normal driving conditions .	-5.2100
Several Volkswagen employees were charged in the United States , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.5303
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.1983
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States .	-2.7953
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions legislation in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was expanded .	-3.9859
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavily burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-2.9696

Mordillo Collen Nases and Laughter AgainU UnACUChiCCCCCCCC	-13.3565
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawings , the knollennases of his figures are his trademark .	-2.8608
The Argentinian still draws 85 and works on a film .	-3.9588
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.8050
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.8034
In the first years as an artist , he proposed himself as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him .	-3.6790
" The most happy day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .    a  a   a   a	-12.2074
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris at the end of the 1960s , he managed to publish his cartoons in Paris Match and then in the " Star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.1767
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.1003
Time and again , the artist could be inspired by cities .	-3.3764
Large , roundy Mordillo figures dumb into drawings with the tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-3.8416
According to the early morning , he is still in the character table , working almost ten hours a day .	-3.5883
Through calendars , puzzles , books for large and small , t-shirts , plushes and watches his drolling figures continue to find a lot of distribution worldwide .	-3.8449
For six years he has also worked on a single string and a TV series with his figures .	-3.8285
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a grafe - mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand players .	-3.6370
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will come to the Kinoleinwand in 2019 .	-3.4906
" I do not know exactly what they will say it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-1.6722
The screenbook is not written by him .	-1.7259
He therefore relies more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wordlessly .	-3.7712
Threatens the Provence of Climate Change	-9.1117
He has become a symbol of the provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.6427
The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases , what scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions is major headaches min! I !! !	-19.3309
Eric Chaisse , expert at the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in the Provence , said : " The lavender in the Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.3103
This has an impact on the life of Lavendel .	-2.0935
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicades , and there are many of them in very dry weather . "	-3.7144
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.4972
Lavender oil is not only attractive to holidaymakers , it is also very required for perfume and cosmetics .	-3.6884
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant drills with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.5588
So we have less parts with ethereal oil . '	-2.7678
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowdown of soil distribution , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .	-4.5024

The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-1.6902
Riodoce employees usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials and incessant drug wars .	-3.7822
But this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to speak about safety .	-12.2645
They have been informed that it is important to change their routines .	-1.8745
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office in 2009 who were the objective of an attack with granates or let them at home .	-4.1702
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .	-1.9588
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and belly sentiments are enou .	-12.7301
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists who are suspected of standing on the salary list of the government or cartels , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous . min .	-11.7526
There is no rest period of violence , and , while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are increasing : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 have been under attacks and threats under federal protection and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.6991
Among the latter , her editor and her inspirator of Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.0382
" The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist " , Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs .	-2.5223
His absence is found deeply everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " , hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-4.7923
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their dreams , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-2.9321
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on Protecting Journalists , it has only opened two criminal proceedings .	-12.4150
As with most thousands of killings linked to drug trafficking and organised crime each year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely put before court . minthe of min!!!!!!!!!	-12.7275
Riodoce still insists on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are undelicious , and even though the territory is even more traitory .	-20.3876
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting of security has little benefit , Ibarra says .	-12.7359
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.6573
" As long as we do not know why we are all mistrustful . "	-3.4778
In the morning of 15 May , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the Capital of Culiacan .	-2.6002
He only managed to go a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with " Twelfter River " .	-4.8430
The shooter went away in his car and damaged it near .	-3.5640
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.7292
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.1340
Rumours tend to fly around in Culiacan .	-1.7512
But there is virtually nothing silent about Valdez .	-2.6161
Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields since last year ’ s arrest and extradition to the United States in January , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.3530
There is nothing that every day in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the street , or that the graveyard is full of decorated two-story mausoleums for drug rows that are larger than many houses for living .	-4.3666
Forget for a minute that there is a state of peace when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .	-3.0290
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , has broken with blame for not being able to protect his friend .	-3.2177
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.3118
First there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-2.7020
This publication may have annoyed the sons , girls suspected bought each copy of the output once it was delivered to newspaper kiosk .	-3.7816
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper , which published the same story .	-3.0902
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.6102
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.0432
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he merged with five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold US dollars involvement .	-4.2275
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without tackling the nuclear problem , " said Bojorquez .	-3.0640
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.0452
Reporters loved to be able to publish tough investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.3500
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-12.2005
In the same year , Valdez won the ' International Press Freedom Award ' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history , wherever she led .	-3.3887
He gave voluntary assumption that he was afraid .	-13.3274
" I would like to live " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.0788
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-1.8859
" You need to take on the task that you have as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-4.1461
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was happening ? '	-3.3027
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird that could flee like a port worker , the friend who was generously broadcasting and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.8374
They familiarized his routine .	-2.8349
He would always carry his hat .	-1.5494
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office and always sit on the same table .	-2.5080
Now they ask : was his love to routine his depravity ?	-3.4316
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and remain alive .	-2.9389
" You may not like it if you are looking for their women , their children , their clean business , their secret starting and landing tracks " to move drugs .	-5.4738
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.5292
The result , even in the best times , is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.3373
His own instincts trust .	-1.1379
If it is wrong , it will be left away .	-3.2420
The anger is , the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that ' smell a sense that can be misled ... and then the thing happened with Javier ' .	-3.6752
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .	-8.9422
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.5142
In the space where Riodoce met security training , mobile phones were suddenly not allowed , and days before , it was previested that spywas sold every of the governof governin order particular surveof in Mex, to moeve jparticievants even more .	-21.5020
There were two policemen seeking protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-12.7689
They were commissioned by the national government to protect Riodoce offices in a four-story building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-2.7856
Half in joke , some of the reporters asked themselves whether these officers belong to the 50 % of the policemen , which the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-3.6212
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.1812
For this week 's issue , Riodoce has looked at three main stories .	-2.4322
There was the assassination of the brother of former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.1754
They also had an exposé on government spending , focused on the home town of the Governor .	-3.2655
And there was a group carried out a kidnap in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the Public Prosecutor 's office .	-2.7642
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so caution was offered to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities .	-3.1671
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all the centuries all political levels .	-3.3169
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of corruption because of high-quality cases .	-2.8486
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military accident .	-3.1282
Only a few months earlier , the readers would have seen the Valdez column as the best informed source of kidnapping .	-2.8470
" We had already known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the top name " El Flaco " because of its slender body stature .	-3.4003
" Now all channels of communication have broken with our sources . "	-2.4116
The Valdez office has been transformed into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because the employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-13.9381
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the Public Prosecutor 's office .	-3.1268
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.8768
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.1077
In the whole country , journalists have become stronger by writing down in organised protests " SOS Press " on paths and buildings .	-13.4155
On this day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the Valdez judiciary .	-3.2158
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day following the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and killing them because they said the truth .	-2.9677
She has asked since then to be re-divided by the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-3.6119
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-2.2420
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by commands of politicians and security forces that were under a ceiling with organised crime .	-3.6204
The media guardian group " Articulo 19 " assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials journalists last year .	-2.4578
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth " , said Ramirez .	-1.6474
Obviously , murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.0798
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipa six years ago .	-1.8216
Your body was found together with a note signed by the Zetas cartel : " I am here because of my reports " .	-2.8859
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head .	-2.4000
Some branches have chosen to close , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.5169
Others continue , as El Manana did in 2004 from Nuevo Laredo following the murder of her director  .	-3.3828
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed to the drug cartel with a guide article on the front page with the heading " What do you want from us ? "	-3.3100
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .	-2.2609
It is a painful decision .	-0.9183
It is hard to find work in exile and they still watch the roads and look for dangers .	-2.4520
And sometimes they are driven , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.4248

Sirenen today close - another shooting in the area .	-8.2804
Bojorquez raised a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were willing .	-3.2153
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-2.0708
Riodoce employees followed his tracks under the huge portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa .	-4.2514
" As you can only remember , " said Bojorquez , " if on the same day that Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send them to the streets . "	-15.9123
Dinosaur used tearning to evade his enemies	-2.7612
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.0458
Researchers have now found that the first findings of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker were so well received that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-3.4536
It was so good that they could even notice that his scared skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had had something of a " disquiet past " .	-5.1159
The report in the journal ' Current Biology ' described it as ' the best preserved dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world ' .	-3.2463

According to reports in National Geographic , the tanked plant fresser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.1466
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.7688
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock , and decided to look closer .	-3.2637
The Fossil , discovered by him , was sent to the Royal Tyrrell museum of Paleontology .	-15.6961
They spent the next six years on detecting the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) of heavy earth lumps .	-16.3549
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-12.1152
" If you only blink a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-4.1271
" It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs . !! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-10.5435
Researchers have found that , although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank , these plant freshness dinosaurs probably were threatened by meat .	-4.9227
The heavily adjusted dinosaur used a red and white tearning to hide from predatory animals , and used a screening technology known as counter-shade used by many modern animals .	-4.8091
This would have allowed themselves to mix and avoid their enemies better , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-4.7465
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines in May and is now seen in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.2861
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it is called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully .	-4.1379
The surprising preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of drawings and armor on his body .	-3.3830
They discovered the conversation , a widespread method of defence in the animal rich , which means that the top of creature was darker than its subsidiary .	-4.1850
Although contershade is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today .	-4.1742
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by meat freshing dinosaurs that evolution favored confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.3199
But most contemporary animals using contershadow - think of row , zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival .	-4.1891
" Strong predatory behavior on a massive dinosaur show how dangerously the dinosaur animals of circulation have been " , Brown said .	-4.6176
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was redbrown .	-2.1320
Scientists continue to investigate the animal information about his life , including his preserved darming content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-4.0726
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was entered into a river and driven into the sea where he fell on the back to the sea .	-4.1930
At this time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further than they are today .	-2.7941
" This nodosaur is remarkable because it is fully covered with conserved skin , but also preserved in three dimensions and contains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-3.5884
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early circle period .  evno, it s a ! !! !!a !!!!	-12.7163
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you only sleep a little with the eyes , you might almost believe that it is in the sleep . "	-5.2252
The circle period was a time when huge theropods , meat dinosaurs that were on two legs through the earth .	-4.7552
Although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaurus Rex , millions of years after Borealopelta , the dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrible ancestors .	-3.5232
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-2.6516
The scientists whose latest knowledge appears in the Current Biology professional magazine believe that Borealopelta was dropped in the sea after death and mified in mud .	-4.7371
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.5457
According to the museum , it is the best preserved dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snow to the hips .	-3.4780
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and were up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.4218
It contained two 20 customs long tips that sustained from his shoulders .	-3.9548
The researchers believe that the crowded plant fresher was flooded through the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .	-3.8323
But underwater burial of the dinosaur preserves its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.6584
The stoned remains of this special copy are so well received that the skin remains still cover magnificent tank plates along the dinosaur .	-4.8531
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto .	-2.5260
The more I look , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.6847
Astonized remains of the skin still cover the wooden tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-4.3125
His right foot is on his side , his five fingers are priced upwards .	-2.8061
I can count the scups on his sole ' .	-1.8803
Mass Carambolate on A8 : Many Injuries	-3.0431
Secret accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolate .	-3.3548
There are numerous injured , kilometres long traffic and gafer .	-3.7248
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at the late Thursday afternoon .	-3.6624
Following the first information from the police , at 5 p.m. between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen connectors ( Aichach-Friedberg country ) , nearly 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were collapsed .	-6.0274
The exact number of injured initially did not provide information .	-2.7442
They are easy to medium-sized injuries , said a police store .	-13.8954
A great deal of rescue vehicles was at the site of the accident .	-3.2719
The A8 was fully blocked in the direction of Munich .	-1.7546
In the direction of Munich , a ten kilometres long backdrop was formed .	-4.1608
As an AZ reporter reported , there were also massive disabilities on the risk - through numerous graphers .	-17.8644
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers who now have sensitive penalties .	-3.8543
Shortly after 18 : 45 there was another second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.7683
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-2.6963
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accideat . !!!!!!!!!!	-9.8637
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.4811
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing sits in the train and sleeps .	-3.7245
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a big thought .	-3.5123
And then : bufff .	-1.4833
Comes from the sheep and arouses an unsoft or releases the passenger from the workflow .	-5.3885
Card control .	-1.4740
But the times of interruptions are over soon .	-2.1506
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the creative ticket control .	-10.4965
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and devalue your ticket .	-3.7390
Currently , a test operation runs on two routes .	-15.8340
" If the supply is offered , we extend it .	-3.0637
It will then probably be available at many other distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " a railway spokesperson said .	-3.7429
" Comfort check-in " calls the train ticket devaluation without sheep .	-3.0444
In order to be able to use , however , some requirements must be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .	-15.8568
And you have to book an online ticket - which already does most passengers .	-3.1149
You also need to buy it via the app of the train , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets .	-4.2751
Last but not least , we need a seat reservation .	-2.1541
Because the " comfort check-in " works like you get to the train , calling his ticket under " My Tickets " .	-12.7905
A button for electronic devaluation appears at the test customers .	-2.9821
The train companions get a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .    ununun!!!!!!!!!!	-16.2805
If the train accompanied by the ticket control at Platz Y he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-4.3797
So you can sleep on , continue working , remain silent .	-2.6738
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railways , which should use passengers in turn .	-11.4388
" If you want to travel without ticket control through our train accompanying staff , just check in the DB Navigator yourself .	-4.0278
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personally , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Management Board of DB remote transport .	-2.7710
Secondly , " And our employees have more time than they are today to address individual customer requirements " .	-3.2773
Those who often train know that in addition to delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the biggest anger .	-4.4452
For often you have yourself , but in any case you do not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-4.8154
Either the credit card or identity card or any other document you must show .	-14.9048
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passengers , leading to poor mood in the department or greater space and delays in controlling their own ticket and the creator at the end takes the time to look at other concerns .	-5.4513
Even a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-10.5625
And this also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgar f .	-12.9929
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet freed .	-2.6957
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Whose Streets ? "	-1.9021
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken up to her core .	-2.2777
Only a day after she arrived in New York City , the one in St. Louis Geborene saw on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.8478
She stumbled over a post from someone from the high school .	-2.1721
" The police have just killed a 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " it said there .	-3.0534
If nobody else had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.6916
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah has been retweeted on their timeline .	-2.8402
The Rapper from St. Louis was killing the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed 18-year-old black 18-year-old who was killed by a white police in Ferguson , Mo . . , live to bet .	-4.1252
He posted a picture of Brown ’ s lible body that was extended on the street and would stay there four hours .	-15.3561
" That is wild , " Ferrell thought about itself .	-2.4226
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.3712
She laid her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the evening .	-3.3554
There were photos of the police band and people who write , and by a man who claimed to be Brown ’ s father , who came a sign : " Ferguson ’ s police has just killed my unarmed son ! "	-4.0199
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a barren dog .	-3.2857
In another video she said , she saved another policeman his gun and write : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-2.9121
" This is not customary , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-11.7952
" That is not the kind of murder we used to , and that we can call typical . "	-17.6479
At this moment I felt shaking frost .	-2.2329
I was angry and cry ' .	-1.7529
It booked a return flight and went home on the next day .	-11.0752
After landing at 23 a.m. , she returned her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-3.5653
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11th .	-14.5692
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of the people who live in the Community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-3.4927
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , who had a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a countless time before this morning » about black experience and black condition « .	-4.8938
" You remember how I taught you , when black people must fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-2.8772
" We are now going to Ferguson , because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.6941
I could not take them , " said Ferrell later .	-2.1256
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.1909
It must know and it must be watched down .	-3.6081
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves .	-3.1988
Although I am fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a flagrant racism , she is no different from the next black child of women .	-4.1161
I feel that I would show her a bad service to keep her away from it . ' I fe !!!!!!!!!!!!	-12.6057
The first station to arrive in Ferguson was on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which was becoming a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-15.2147
Ferrell and her daughter connected there with a local business holder who made lunch .	-3.1497
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.6673
Slowly , a new type of activism for Ferrell began to accept shape .	-11.7487
" My activism changed totally after August 9 , " she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St . Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.2437
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.4118
Everything happened ' .	-1.9719
Weeks later , Ferrell met one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan .	-2.3416
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado farrar just wanted to " document " , which happened .	-2.2782
One question came to Ferrell : ' Want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? '	-2.9611
This scepticism has been fed by innumerable cases of people , often by whites - in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .	-3.2511
As Folayan recently said in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.1358
Folayan had already collaborated with the then Co-director Damon Davis , an artist in the field known for his activism around death stract inscriptions .	-4.2802
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years to Brown 's shoo .	-13.8827
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us . " We talk , " said Davis .	-2.6232
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are described , because that is how I will be presented . "	-4.5397
The aim was not to focus on Ferrels ’ experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant of the film .	-3.8982
As a result , documents from Whose Streets show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life , as she loves and her wife marries .	-3.0703
" I felt like naked " , said Ferrell and laughed when they saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.9166
" But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-2.8788
Furthermore , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black lives matter movement .	-2.5112
Two of the three founders of the movement , which , following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , characterized the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify itself as gay .	-3.1746
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-3.1255
Black , gay women must wear the main burden of everything . "	-8.9806
Folayan agreed to note that ' the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women ' .	-2.2449
However , it insists that ' this is not an affirmative type of action ' where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film due to its identity .	-3.1938
" She was the person who appeared this energy , " she said .	-2.6077
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because in a life of these crossings as a black gay woman there is so much at stake .	-4.4196
You can feel their energy through the screen . "	-1.9391
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but racial connections between the community and the police remain .	-2.9592
Ferrell is on profit for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway in a demonstration .	-3.7240
She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : ' A chaos ' .	-2.8735
Nevertheless , she is complaining of a vocals and she feels committed to this memory since he was on the streets in Ferguson three years ago .	-4.8797
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.8243
It is our duty to win .	-0.8747
We must love and support each other .	-1.1140
We have nothing to lose - except our chains ' .	-1.6541
From " dream " to " size " : TV readers discuss bit gallery	-2.3262
The bit gallery moves people , although it has not been built for a long time .	-3.0129
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone divides the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .	-3.2673
Cold does hardly leave the subject .	-9.8769
On our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " the subject is also being discussed .	-2.5767
While those say to the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole shows ) , come from the other side : " No man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Siggi column ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-5.0106
While supporters build on a gallery pulling more customers into the city , which also benefits the other business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed .	-5.0785
Additionally , the gallery is planned on the plot where the farm market hall , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-4.2114
This will end with the beginning of the construction work .	-2.7130
Gallery machers want to integrate a market hall into the new construction - for Beda Square with possibility for outdoor seats .	-4.2451
Simone Room : " We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years .	-2.8071
Mainly our eggs , as well as the delicious cakes of women again and again .	-4.0847
We also discovered the area of the metal .	-3.8219
We would like to see an opportunity , even during and above all after the construction of the gallery , to maintain this offer .	-3.2633
There are other cities as well .	-2.2051
Above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-2.2865
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the height of the rent .	-3.8338
However , that may not be exactly low in the new project ' .	-3.4864
Eva Kilic : " What shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.9468
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-2.5251
There is enough of this in our city .	-2.4251
You can see how many shops stand empty here - some for months and years .	-3.1005
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important for us to keep the market hall at least .	-3.5973
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , largely offered directly by the producer and are also cheap .	-3.6413
As you can see , shops are rented in a shopping centre only by larger companies , because they are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-3.9258
Shade , special transactions almost no longer exist and what is left will probably disappear . '	-4.0610
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not match me .	-1.9255
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.3628
Above all , where should the farm market be highlighted during the construction period ?	-3.6360
The old edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-2.8901
Or does the specter Bit gallery manage to drive all shops from Bitburg beforehand ? "	-3.9809
George Marquet : " This simply will not work .	-1.5556
And a shopping centre that is empty needs nobody .	-2.3885
In my view , it would have been better to promote a proper farming market rather than this gallery .	-2.7174
But for a farm market hall , thanks to the incredibly many - I think - there are no longer any pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-17.5512
When the farm market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-3.4683
A similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-1.9587
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York , there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables .	-4.5607
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfers and hair cuts sent to it by Chelsea Manning .	-3.0412
Manning sent the sections from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former secret service analyst left a 35-year prison sentence after publishing it as secret diplomatic reports on WikiLeaks website .	-4.2543
The new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) . !	-16.1659
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline unites its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and manning , a transfer and dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .	-3.9849
Dewey-Hagborg has been extracted by the algorithmic analysis of the DNA , which was extracted by manning and created from the 30 portraits , as someone could look like with these genomic data , a sharp , albeit something intellectual , not only to the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and created the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also to identity .	-5.5800
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but spoke openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was condemned for 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the Spionage Act , Computer Fraud and Thiefstahl .	-4.0549
Through the prison , their image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grainy , black and white self-head where manning obviously sits uncomfortably on a driver 's seat and wears a platinblond piece - associated with it .	-6.4705
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-12.5256
It produced portraits of foreign artists from foreign artifacts such as cigarette numbers and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people might look like .	-4.3581
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-1.7895
" They led an interview with Chelsea Manning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-11.5383
And it could not be visited at this time and it could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked if they wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.6041
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letters who exchanged several letters over two years .	-3.8940
They even created a comic " suppressed images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , predicting a future in which President Chelsea 's ruling would be converted and able to see the exhibition personally .	-3.7278
Indeed , only a few days after the book was published , Obama ’ s release would demand manning after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-15.0801
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , competitive ways to flame the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .	-4.8294
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that ' things happen for a particular reason ' .	-13.2866
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , manning called for its excessive signature among them ( the " i " in their family name is provided with a heart ) an end to " automatic fragmentation , whose basis was gender , race , sexuality and culture " .	-14.5660
On the opposite wall , its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand features of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-3.5569
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-2.7265
" What people will hopefully take part in it is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work is 2007 , Spurious Memories , too .	-13.2447
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories " .	-2.3409
The last piece in the exhibition , preserved in its own room , is a page from the comic novel mentioned above .	-3.5919
It shows manning how it appears in the hands of a free speaking phone from the United States disciplinary barracks such as King Kong .	-4.2061
" If you cold your speech , then you won " , says .	-3.2881
" So never stops the mouth " .	-1.6608
" It came directly from a letter she written to me , " said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia .	-2.4623
" I still get gaze when I talk about it . "	-2.7864
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was prejudiced in the comicbook - but if it were to do so , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by its own genomic simulators , which collapsed like Hordes of Protesters .	-15.3932
That was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 , manning stature ) where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-4.1780
" In the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted to feel like a quantity of human beings , " said Dewey Hagborg from the portraits .	-3.1503
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-3.0593
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford for Kila	-11.4596
A nationwide hunting is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are seeked as suspects after a man had been broken up in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with deadly injuries .	-4.5883
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murders for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the acts of the Cook County Court .	-3.1921
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several sticks .	-2.0360
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.1553
Officials received a call , came to the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.6310
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared at the place of what happened to be dead , and detective investigation into the killing as murder , while the police actively seek for the two suspects , said officials .	-4.8273
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-1.7231
Alan K. Cubbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now in leave and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-3.4885
" This is now a criminal matter examined by the competent authorities , and the Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-2.8352
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.3309
A spokesman of the university and Somerville College said in an e-mail declaration that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to help the US investigative authorities in every possible way ' .	-3.5164
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted he to stand up .	-2.6191
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged the suspects to face up to the authorities .	-2.8922
" The police have an idea of their location , and our efforts to localize them , " said Guglielmi .	-3.3807
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the suspects .	-1.9450
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a magnificent tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.4585
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.1455
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.1772
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-1.8262
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.6146
The Grand Plaza management team published a declaration to the inhabitants : " The police are currently working on the time axis and the victim 's background and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident " .	-3.4904
" We will complete the WADA road map in the near future " - the Russian Vice-Prime Minutko	-2.2229
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-2.9514
" At a particular stage of compliance with the road map criteria , RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-2.9623
The WADA road map has been updated in this respect , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-17.5140
The PM commented the second part of the WADA road map on compliance with the code described the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and recently published on the Organization website .     a   a a   a  !	-13.7257
According to Mutko , he contains nothing that could give rise to concern to Russia .	-2.6028
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-1.6711
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future " , he added .	-2.0354
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on allegedly supported doping in Russian sport .	-3.9269
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : ' We carry out the investigation as our anti-doping system acknowledged a mistake .	-3.2957
All measures have been implemented .	-1.0850
But there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-2.2228
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-12.1466
In conversation with the Russian sales point at the beginning of the day , Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.2983
Nobody intends to accept this report unconditionally ' added Smirnov .	-2.6098
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia during the doping scandal in November 2015 .	-2.4454
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.1297
After a visit to the main quarter of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving " in the right direction " to restore .	-3.8746
For the time being , Aldi sells no more eggs	-2.7611
That was what the groups of companies informed . , and as, as!!!!!	-10.1119
It was a precautionary measure and no health impairment could be expected in the communication .	-4.2610
From now on , only eggs are likely to be supplied to Aldi , which were proven negative to fipronilatory anti-run resources .	-5.2820
Aldi wants to make clarity and transparency among its customers .	-2.3315
The Start ups that will help your company not become the next update	-2.2629
Amy Errett wanted to measure the luck at your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys did not work .	-2.7816
Answers were often vague , little helpful or even worse .	-2.5233
Even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not dare the process .	-1.7700
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who runs the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-2.6839
She has called people from outside for help .	-1.2947
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing in order to help businesses find out how their employees feel	-13.1202
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it enables companies to carry out surveys , to address specific groups and demographic groups , to offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allow Whistleblower to circumvent the C-Suite leaders and turn directly to the Board of Directors .	-4.4583
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees .	-3.3211
Save said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years .	-3.7197
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance what units have the most complaints and which leaders have low approval results - so you can retrieve why .	-4.7677
Companies come to recognize that at the top of the workplace culture , you must not become the next uber that has been involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished .	-4.5662
For start-ups like Glint , this desire is a lucrative business overview .	-2.3839
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial technical site Let 's Talk Payments .	-2.6894
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , helping businesses prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the upper case in discredit .	-3.8337
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.4762
Recently registered as a client .	-2.0058
Like Glint , Convercent offers tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-3.7546
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behaviour .	-3.1183
And if the main manager is included , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.4205
" The court of public opinion has collected regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.6894
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , employee fluctuation and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.0862
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their business centre .	-3.4263
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to find a telephone number or e-mail to the corporate centre , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-10.2617
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesday ’ s General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to monitor the complaints of employees .	-11.0125
Now that Convercent is using , problems previously hidden by leaders who were in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-3.8555
" I can get closer to this holistic 360 degree view of experience with employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.5106
" And we protect our shareholders from job disputes ' .	-2.1374
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee commitment in 2002 more seriously after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations of the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.7354
But it took until the ' social media came to their right ' that companies realised that you could not prevent their dirty laundry went online .	-3.3897
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , hope used as a strategy , " he said .	-1.8089
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service , and burden companies with repeated charges for the use of their products .	-3.0539
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of Venture Capital Investors who supported both start ups .	-2.9381
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , increasing the total capital to $ 47 million .	-2.7676
Glitzers secured $ 10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all of its funding to $ 60 million .	-2.9738
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.1652
There is a growing complex of research , showing that today 's employees expect more jobs than they have done so far .	-2.8169
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only uses .	-2.2200
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.0345
" If people are happy to feel in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work that you are doing is worth feeling strongly committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , using both Convercent and Glint .	-4.2179
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well , businesses run well when employees are committed and committed .	-3.1414
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees , there is no wonder you will find support .	-3.3891
The data on employee commitment according to the experts in the workplace culture important .	-2.7676
But the data are useless if a company ’ s administrators do not take measur .	-17.8719
Indeed , if a company asks for your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-2.6211
And if change does not come quickly enough , or even not , it can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .	-3.2402
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International , the companies that have left too much on collecting data .	-3.8930
" For if you 're not following will employees ask themselves , " Did you really hear me ?	-3.8461
Do you take care of that ?	-2.3015
And who you do not care about why should I ? '	-2.2176
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported on glint , so sav ! ! !! ! ! !!! ! !we !!!!!	-11.7894
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication to address the problems .	-3.5556
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting increasingly new insights about employees , and it hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better link between workers in an industry known as high sales .	-5.1440
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.7298
" And if you lose people , you will also lose customers .	-1.8219
If you lose customers , you will lose business .	-9.9856
NCAA eliminates two day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins	-2.2605
A lot of UCLA football players are on one side of the new team 's new practice areas .	-4.9179
Some have withdrawn their tricotobers and show the back full of welding from the first day of the training camp .	-3.9451
For a good part of the team , these inactive minutes represent a lunch break .	-2.4826
Players who are written to the summer courses will return after the three-hour exercise to their final tests before they return to the Waterman Football Center on the next morning .	-4.1963
" This is a real mill for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.1087
NCAA eliminates two day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players , and has actually extended their days - at least until Friday finals .	-3.3524
Therefore , the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the players ' already completed timetables .	-4.5799
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and practical exercises performed for the first time during the summer school in Westwood .	-3.8867
During the August 18 exercises are to be held ; 20 before the start of formal gaming preparations for Texas A & M in September .	-5.0308
Mora said that he supported the regulation of NCAA , even if they add another point to the multi-employed routes of the players .	-3.3667
" We put this enormous burden on it three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.1911
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to place , they are great people .	-3.2627
I think when we come to Saturday and we have more time , it really will be great . '	-2.9487
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished , which , given the clear lines of its fields , will be no easy task in the face of an adjoining parking space and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the high class , which has already been designed with footballs that cleared a protection network behind a torcycle .	-7.2173
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-3.3002
" We will use our security " , said Mora .	-8.8032
" This is a real problem , and it is not far away from thinking that people rent there a room and then adapt to record an exercise there .	-4.7308
If you have a video band from an exercise , it is a pretty good business . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-10.8370
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .	-2.0004
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.0276
I am therefore not all too concerned about this .	-2.4234
We have a plan ' .	-0.7267
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit messages	-2.3608
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to fact verifiers of third parties and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of work to combat even so-ceveryday fac!	-16.3221
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false messages and send them to fact checkers who may display results of the fact examination from the original article .	-4.2904
Facebook was criticised as one of the main points of distribution for so-called Fake-News , many of which believe that they also affected the US presidential elections in 2016 .	-3.0229
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooding with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to resolve hateful postings as they were in September .	-4.1986
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact review would be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-2.9197
" Besides the knowledge of what stories are challenged by fact reviewers of third parties , people want more context to take sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .	-3.9545
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature for the " associated article " and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .	-3.4232
Create a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.1298
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980 ’ s .	-3.0824
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River valley in Kent and has now become inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaard Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.5964
" I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of somebody who has been dead for 300 years , " he says honest .	-3.5727
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand " .	-1.9857
" A Castle in England " reveals the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-3.8635
It is not the first book of rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional .	-2.4436
" I only responded to the pressure on the side of a letter that was written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.0601
" That is his thumb impression !	-3.3870
And letters always smoke , because at that time they raised a fire because of the light .	-3.5287
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were himself .	-3.1322
Oh , I love archives ! '	-0.9160
For someone who is beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome " ) this seems all too nice to be true .	-12.8045
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the assembled heads of the mountains on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in diof in of . of in of !!!!!!!!!!	-13.1034
He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscapes , gardeners and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-3.7400
Then , night he trank " Whiskey and started to write " .	-2.1243
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heritage , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-2.8494
When Rhodes reached a decade later , employees just began to take care of the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , discuss it on the roof floor .	-4.3699
Diary books , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent who had what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fought the two families .	-4.0732
God , let everything go his way ! '	-2.3646
Some of the stories in the collection used the castle as a starting point for diving on a broader basis in English history , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 farm at the rise of the 1381 .	-5.1498
" There is a record of an appearance that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.2967
" The revolt began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .	-2.9552
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-1.6953
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuitenpater , hidden by the Darrell family for seven years during the English reformation .	-3.8098
Or The Smuggler , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell was displayed from the 18th century , who staged his own burial by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made first years later than his coffin ) .	-4.7770
The Darrels are Rhodes ' family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be fairly cruelty , repeatedly make debts and spend money on things they could not afford . !! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-13.2249
Other generations of Darrell men solve their debt crises by marriing rich old women - I present them as a bunch of good boys , with a talent to advertise inheritants . '	-12.2907
After the end of his commitment in the castle , Rhodes is in search of other unique writing experiences	-12.1821
He brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness to a comic novel about Elämäki , the terrain of a sanatorium dating back to the early twentieth century , which has since been requested by nature .	-4.3656
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.1405
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.0515
It was like : " Oh , now I have to read with the condemned life " .	-3.6988
Campaign launched : Over 300 years old Maria Chapel in Rhöndorf	-3.1834
Bad Honnef on Friday launched its campaign to introduce a new roof brand ( Rundschau von Thursday ) with the disof !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-15.8335
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.6989
At the end of August there should be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as a highlight of the campaign .	-3.4792
" Too beautiful for us .	-1.4850
Or ? " , the makers of the action since yesterday ask the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel .	-3.4175
" We think this ( of course ! ) not really " , write it on your website that was released yesterday .	-3.9825
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.3881
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems .	-2.0014
Basically , we are firmly convinced that we know as Bad Honnefer citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-3.3325
The action talks about more than " only " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.7376
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unique feature of its own . "	-5.1011
Finally , they are in competition with other communities .	-10.6425
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof brand and campaign .	-3.5599
Turkey 's Erdogan Fear of the Army	-1.6911
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises retirement and transportation in the officer scorps .	-3.2954
This week , too .	-1.6964
At first glance a normal process .	-1.9980
But nothing is routine among Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.4614
The sitting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as previously , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-3.3500
The five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs have now participated in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government .	-3.6285
That was the overnumber of civilians in YAS .	-2.8630
The government attracts the reins in the military .	-1.0906
Although Hulusi Akar ’ s chief staff remains in office , the army ’ s commanders , the airforce , and the naval were dismissed .	-4.7881
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan fired the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.0584
More than 10,000 troops were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as a wire attempt .	-4.8063
486 people who have been directly involved in the coup trial have been negotiated in Ankara since this week .	-3.2234
Erdogan described him as " God 's gift " on the day after the coup , as he gives him the opportunity to purify the armed forces " completely .	-5.1652
But does Erdogan really have the army under control ?	-1.8993
At the end of February the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article with the heading " unease in the military quarter " .	-2.5357
In the general staff , there were concerns about the increasing ' Islamisation ' of the army , which , among other things , manifested in the lifting of the headscarf ban on soldiers , wrote the newspaper .	-4.5622
Big power in the army and security forces continues .	-3.1497
In mid-July , Erdogan fired another 7395 state servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 troops .	-13.8085
It seemed that Erdogan was tamed the military .	-2.3336
The generals were former than the country ’ s actual gentlemen .	-3.0766
Three times they appealed for their role as guardians of the secular order .	-3.0090
After his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step back , not least on the reform requirements of the European Union .	-3.8226
Former officers say Erdogan is driving forward an islamisation of the armed forces .	-3.2960
The Vocal Europe magazine warned a non-mentioned officer who sought asylum after the coup trial , that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' .	-4.7201
If so , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.1906
In any case , the alliance following the cleansing doubts about the willingness to use the Turkish army .	-3.1973
The leadership structures and operational abilities are " weakened " , say Nato diplomats .	-2.3239

The Ministry and South Thuringia Railway as operators are already agreed on the technical details .	-2.8357
" This is what the road map , the vehicles used and quality standards are negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.6871
The planned treaty between the Ministry and the Railway Society is closed for a period of 11 years .	-2.7735
This will regularly order the Rensteig-Shuttle on December 2017 .	-2.7499

The rise of sex robots is real , and we should concern ourselves	-1.9681
Especially when you thought that 2017 cannot become even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the sex robots sector is coming .	-4.1245
Yes , in fact .	-0.9840
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-1.7467
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .	-2.0068
According to Noel Sharkey , emerited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-2.7758
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast wart and the type of fingernail .	-2.7969
" People are fun about them , but businesses are supplying a lot of it , and we will see it much more often , " Mr Sharkey said when he published his new report .	-4.4534
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human responses achieved by artificial intelligence .	-13.1220
The user can also adjust his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the form of breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.5834
But it becomes even more disturbing as many robots have the " personalities " that a Stepford woman would look progressive .	-2.8577
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.2353
For example , the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appropriate , such as shy .	-3.8890
And then there are the Roxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shaking and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-3.9472
" Roxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as much as possible " warms the website of True Companion .	-2.7548
So she likes what you like , and she does not like what you do not like , etc .	-2.1698
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.2639
It can be tired , be fixed on conversation or it can be " in mood " ! "	-2.5382
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relations - but the underground female characteristics , rape allusions , when you attach a step to Frigid ( here : reluctant ) Farrah worry one most .	-5.4425
On its website compared to True Companion Roxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.1148
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have a roxxy ? " it says on the site .	-17.4308
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just a different sex toys .	-2.4259
Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something darker and depths in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality towards a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-4.6242
Most men will of course not hold sex robots , and while the FRR remains increasing popularity , they remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture .	-4.1331
But what transpires from the peripheral zones can be very teaching about the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.5153
And many people are not strange or offending until the free market gives them permission .	-2.0695
There is , after all , a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots are emerging at a time when women 's rights are threatened worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who has brushed to attack women sexually .	-4.8052
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphical images , the swallowed body and the encroached eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.3339
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .	-2.2699
The objective behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as technically possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-21.0193
Their builders want to feel human that they helped to move a real body .	-3.7719
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-2.7628
You cannot separate from your companion or just go away .	-2.5887
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that suggests independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-3.0799
In other words , they are due slaves .	-1.6158

Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-0.7047
He makes mitt Romney the inclusion of common sense	-2.3893
It has become a Trump era ’ s wisdom that the political divisions that the US electorate have polarized have also divided families into small formats .	-13.7336
Around Christmas and Harvest , there were newspapers in the US about how to deal with the horror of Trump elected relatives .	-3.5413
We all supposedly strive to place our filter bubbles .	-2.6150
Trump ’ s power to bring families together is less observed .	-1.9145
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet living in Chicago , has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.0535
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.7671
With Trump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republican relationship with which they had fought for decades because of politics , is suddenly and quite strange on the same side .	-4.2703
That is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but I have a further connection that this also brings considerable risks .	-6.1809
The left was strengthened by Trump , but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to put all of us on the right .	-2.8530
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the gross opportunity that one day his girls will not get off .	-4.3317
However , there is an even frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing " normalize " , which suddenly appear as an inclusion of reasonability compared to its standards .	-5.0749
I find myself nowadays involved with an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney 's urcomic version of mad crazy - the dog on the autodach , which 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax declaration was ) - both of which actually occur as a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-6.3941
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be mentally healthy only to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-12.3311
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York Park carousels , and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city if you don 't need a caffeine  !	-11.1349
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are shiny and the animals are turning full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climatic music provides this in a strange way .	-5.2572
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not fulfilled by the dreof the of the d!of ! ! !	-13.9050
Fifty-thirty years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great roundabout in the north of London .	-4.4960
However , the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience , because there are two two-year-olds , one 11-year-old and two women in the 40s and all have a great time .	-4.5960
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but , fortunately , nobody has asked for it that .	-15.1140
On the other hand , this week I was forced to assess my " experience " with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.2129
In the coffee house at the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option of balancing the assessment with a 15 % drinking money - to buy something about the shopping table .	-4.3456
This does not only slow what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to insert personality into a situation where no required .	-18.5734
The poor woman in the department store was apologizingly grinning , while I was tired of experiencing her credit card with five stars .	-14.5698
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison to hospital	-2.6561
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital for the second time .	-2.2668
Last year , he was brought to hospital due to the treatment of cuts , according to the prison authorities , after a case in his cell .	-3.8695
Pistorius was condemned against a first death sentence for murders after an appeal by the prosecutors .	-3.9740
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine Day 2013 by shot them several times through a door of the toilet booth in his house in Pretoria .	-3.9398
Pistorius claimed that he considered his friend to be a nightly invader hiding in the cabin .	-3.6035
The prosecutors have announced their intention , this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Apell , which they say is too indulgent .	-3.6147
The National Prosecution Authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the objection could be heard this year .	-2.9071
Pistorius risks increasing its penalty to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful .	-2.2577
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8800

Three of the dismissal students go to the gymnasium in future , four to the real school .	-3.2406
Schulleiter Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-2.6095
As a symbol of school redundancy , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle growing up in the chicken courtyard but then released into freedom .	-5.1716

Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and left it from his chickens .	-2.1193
Instead of a chicken came out a small eagle .	-2.6258
But the hope of making a chicken out of him was destroyed , the eagle spread out his wings and decided on a high mountain .	-4.7178
Then the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-3.0827
The hens danced with the young gockets that cylinders wear to the bet .	-3.2404
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Site .	-2.5100

Software update for diesel vehicles : What the people concerned need to know now	-2.5568
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.4938
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?	-8.8142
The most important questions and answers .	-2.1913
At the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.3810
They are to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars from the emissions classes Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-3.5465
Euro-4 diesel or worse are exempt .	-2.0189
Anja Smetanin from ACE Auto Club Europe assesses :	-2.3999
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.3899
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.0096
" The obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-2.5525
The Federal Bundesamt ( KBA ) ordered its retrofit .	-4.0919
How and when are customers informed about updates ?	-10.1180
The manufacturers have announced speedy implementation over the coming months , but have not yet mentioned a precise date .	-3.5991
Daimler has communicated to contact everyone concerned .	-2.9439
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-3.2713
How much longer will the reorganizations go ?	-12.6956
" Heavy to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.0553
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure .	-2.2145
" For we have seen that car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the environment . "	-3.2614
How long will the update take ?	-1.3284
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.4443
Time-expensive it may be to get an appointment .	-2.9155

The first prize award under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.2287
One of the winners does not want to come - from protest .	-2.4509
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-2.7360
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year Sängerin Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the writers .	-3.7266
The awards will be handed over in early December .	-1.8263
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in his wife Melania .	-2.8363
The Lear Prize winner , known as progressive TV series , announced that he would not take part in the Gala .	-5.0325
The New York Times said : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect arts and human rights - even withdraw the means - and that burdens me ' .	-4.0784

We Make the City Lifeworthy	-3.1304
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city tree champion , goes pension next year .	-3.4460
The site is already published - applicants are quite rare .	-4.4840
Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been a city tree for 31 years .	-3.2981
And the work still makes him great fun as he did in the press conversation .	-3.5671
He reports about varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successors .	-3.3794
At the same time , it wonders that no application meets the requirement profile so far .	-2.9473
The city is looking for an architect or a building engineer at the next possible time .	-2.6291
Thus , with regard to regular termination periods , there is still enough time to start .	-5.0152
As Haslach functions as the lower rights authority for the administrative community , the applicant must show such conclusions .	-4.4695
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city .	-2.5739
If they could no longer fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-3.0817
But citizens are close to the city and it is important itself , says Wacker , who reports of a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and citizens .	-4.2583
In more than 30 years in office , some major projects have gathered back to the wackers with pride .	-3.9678
" We make the city worth life " , he is sure of his building office and his staff .	-4.0367
But there are also varied projects on the agenda in the future : the transformation of the former Hukla area and the low-cost parking area , for example , has been incurred .	-5.4403
The kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a subject .	-9.4115
The latter alone will book about EUR 1.5 million , " if we do it right " , wacker estimates .	-4.6152
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-1.6483

" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green facilities is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-14.4271
Since the old town is an ensemble under monument protection , whether it is important to have an eye on what is purely fitting " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city tree master emphasises .	-5.3942
Without anything , the city tree champion has a high responsibility .	-3.9979
He is Bauherr , " at the end everything is about my table " .	-10.5333
In care and coordination he can count on long-standing employees : Markus Neumaier ( high building ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( deep-building ) for 15 years .	-4.7061
Also that his successor remains long , Wacker wants : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place " .	-3.9468
Continuity is important not only for a good operating climate but also for the continuation of the city .	-3.1564
According to the city of Haslach , Roland Wacker wants to experience a completed study as diploma engineer or bachelor with specialized architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and construction planning .	-16.6935
The city building office includes high and low construction , construction planning , fundamental professional affairs , management of urban properties , urban operating courtyard with building house and urban gardens as well as lower rights authority including monument protection .	-6.4302
Bicycle on Leadings : Locked South Railway	-3.6120
According to the police , the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the transfer of railways in the Leoben Street ( B116 ) to the lines .	-4.2035
They were so damaged that the goods approached had to be stopped .	-3.3711
The investigators go from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-3.1514
Witnesses were observed by witnesses of roller and bicycle riders .	-17.3726
" This goes far beyond a coup , " said Austrian speaker Christoph Posch to the APA .	-3.9991
The perpetrators or the perpetrators would have brought themselves into great danger and would also have endangered train transport . under the auspunishof ministrministr .	-18.9474
Besides damage to the lok and plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement transport , the train customers could also return to the perpetrators .	-6.2053

The damages were fixed again on Friday afternoon , and rail transport on the southern railway could be carried out without disabilities .	-13.8124
Nearly ten passenger trains were made on Friday morning , two of them concerned distance transport .	-3.6256
Goods failed , but they were delayed .	-2.7822

Solators and masts were also damaged .	-1.8203
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help to relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease )	-2.4555
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestion system .	-1.7615
But a new study claims precisely the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases .	-3.1754
The incurable state , which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in Britain , causes stomach and blowing , repetitive or bloody diarrhea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .	-4.6762
While the people concerned normally fail to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant darm .	-4.0893
The senior researcher , Dr Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the darm to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in eating do not enter the body .	-3.2441
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissue .	-2.5281
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory disease .	-2.7793
Experiments found that a type of tolerance promotes immune cell for mice that carry a specific bacterium into their inhabitants .	-20.9169
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-2.3850
Professor Colonna said : " We have a link between a bacteria type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the darm microbiom and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.0196
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-2.4096
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a food rich in tryptophan promotes tolerant , less inflammatory darms if the same system works for humans .	-4.0832
The Postdoctoral Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately stored , did not .	-4.5471
She suspected that the difference had to do with the darm-crobioms of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the stomach darm tract .	-3.9070
The darms of the mice were sequenced by DNA and there were six bacteria species available in the mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in the mice .	-4.1947
Mouse were replaced in a sterile environment , so they lacked a darmmicrobiom and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they gained the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-4.2089
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a fluid and then transferred small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - to inmature immune cells isolated by mice .	-3.5338
The immune cells became the tolerance cells .	-2.5043
When the active component was cleaned from liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism , known as an indol-3 milk acid .	-2.8751
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophane in the food of the mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but when the tryptophane values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.7160
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan stated that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect them in our gastrointestinal darm tracts . until of un! ! !!	-13.3907
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells among people as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory darmer disease .	-4.3307
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the darm .	-3.0081
Potential can cause high tryptophane values in the present of L. reuteri to expand this population . "	-3.4294
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a ' genius '	-2.2004

So now Stephan Weil , too .	-2.0756
Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of the Netherlands has long been in criticism .	-3.1628
These surveys added .	-10.2429
Nevertheless , or perhaps this is precisely why , because over the past few weeks , we have tried to put a greater focus in the covenant .	-6.0334
The pursuit of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained hidden in the context of Martin Schulz .	-3.6399
They could grant it , because they promised to stabilize the party from scratch .	-4.1066
Now , the exact opposite could happen .	-10.3295
Because of the partisan internal division of the Greens of the Netherlands , it is essentially no blame .	-5.4531
And it is not .	-3.1033
For the time being , the courses are endeavouring to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.4980
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and here , above all , the distressing parliamentarian Twesten .	-4.0078
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests on the interests of all the others , " says Matthias Miersch , leader of the party left in the SPD Group , the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-3.6661
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but the national list of the Lower Saxon Greens , so the Lower Saxon Member continua .	-4.8878
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .	-1.9152
Thomas Opermann , chief of the SPD Group , complains a ' undemocratic manoeuvre ' .	-2.7328
" The electoral will four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil a prime minister , " says Opermann , who leads the Lower Saxon SPD as the top candidate in the federal election , the RND .	-3.8307
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU MEP distorted the election result " , Opermann continued .	-3.8296
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.2895
I want to know whether more has been or more promises have been made by the CDU Lower Saxony .	-3.3748
Funding for Place III	-2.9010
Anyone who wants to renovate in the years can soon get support from the country .	-3.7406
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG city development at Wednesday in Empires .	-3.6898
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a glimpse of what has happened .	-2.8170
There have been reception areas since 1991 .	-2.2680
Back then , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden-Württemberg took two-thirds of the sum of funding .	-4.1671
In the renovation area II from 2005 to 2016 , grants were still 60 % .	-3.3452
For Schindler , the previous renovations are a " success project " - it is important to promote internal development , not just to open up new construction areas .	-4.9200
On 4 April , the Bureau of the Karlsruhe Government received the information that there will be a recovery area III .	-2.8769
The sum of funding amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would be from the country , the rest of the municipality .	-3.9319
How does a recovery area arise ?	-2.6490
Schindler will continue to examine where " really old " houses are .	-2.6331
But there is also a role to play whether there is any interest in the planned area .	-3.4163
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be postponed again .	-3.1391
The STEG met on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.4892
Keller presented the content of the Bund country program " Social City " , where the refurbishment would then be carried out .	-3.9057
The core of the programme is the revitalization of cities , the improvement of housing and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.2698
The measures would be implemented objectly , i.e. per plot .	-2.8269
The refurbishment area would then be defined as a statute .	-2.7005
The period of approval for funding has been until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-2.4404
However , until September this year , the inventory would only be carried out , within which the parties involved in the recovery area receive a questionnaire .	-4.8027
In November or December , the Statutes decision is to be made as possible so that the refurbishment can start next year .	-5.1234
Pietzschmann then stated that every local authority must carry out the said pre-investigations .	-3.3287
It is a matter of assessing and deciding when the urban maladministration is renovated and how extensive it is .	-4.9924
It will then be registered in the Grundbook for the respective plot .	-4.4835
Pietzschmann will come back again after receiving a picture of the situation , promised her .	-4.0227
Gotzel emphasised that the participants ' participation is an essential factor in the project .	-3.7829
Therefore there will be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled out until after the end of the summer holidays .	-3.7096
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and plot arc " , which includes , among other things , the construction and refurbishment intentions .	-4.5867
In the grey questionnaire , the " budgetary and housing arc " , information about size , division and residents of a house can be made .	-4.2200
The blue " Operating Bogs " is only to be filled if the business area operates .	-4.4647
However , it is worth noting that Gotzel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-15.5054
Moreover , new construction measures are unsupportable .	-2.6001
Shindler also emphasised that the distribution of funds functions according to the ' wind hund principle ' - who first comes , is first asked .	-20.1100
You cannot reserve funds for later .	-3.0584
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskern II " have been shown to make a refurbishment " tasteful " to the present .	-4.3720
British inventors themselves set a microchip to get to home and car with a hand movement	-12.1010
A British inventor is the first in the country that is equipped with a microchip to open his doors , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.9655
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointing finger and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by their company BioTeq .	-3.3022
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultative anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant process is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.0084
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.0114
The company of Mr Northam also wants to change the castles to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-3.4620

The White House ’ s Advertising Costs Thousands	-1.5339
The White House ’ s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers by the military left to the TIME magazine up to $ 24,000 .	-3.1792
The green white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-2.6793
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials made a tour through products from all 50 countries .	-12.1417
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a fire brigade from Wisconsin and a fork stacker from Mississippi .	-3.3965
The White House ’ s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.5111
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with a high visibility " , the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy marine commander for aviation .	-4.5215
The news showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the event at 3 p.m. , and so long until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.1584
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would need the return flight because of the limitation of services .	-3.6545
The original flight occupation was at the helicopter during the event , while the security staff of unity remained on the ground during the period of time .	-4.0165
The records provided by the TIME were not clear whether a second crew was ultimately needed .	-3.8416
Hatch Act prohibits state-owned property for political purposes .	-2.4568
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could infringe the destiny .	-2.5182
" A question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the command wrote .	-2.7802
" Sounds as if you are closed " , the deputy commander responded .	-2.6337
The event " Made in America " was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.0821
But official events also have political uptons .	-1.6325
At the event , the President gave an incentive to reform the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb the rules of government .	-4.3860
Use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .	-2.0735
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel .	-1.8824
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.6882
In February , Trump carried out an investigation when the presidential aircraft provided a message against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-4.4980
" The White House is delighted by the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Press Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.2911
HMX-1 crews often perform training flights in the area around Washington and the South Lawn to settle US presidents in the White House with precise centimeter rates .	-13.7092
When Trump was at the G20 Summit in Germany at the beginning of July , HMX-1 executed 58 training lands in the White House .	-3.1354
The flight for the " made in America " event was one of the officials when the flight needs to be trained .	-4.2730
Helicopter units flow 11 hours this day for ' non-presidential support missions ' .	-2.8625
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requisites presented at the event .	-2.0852
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.2818
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event .	-2.8740
According to hour tariffs of the US Defense Department for the financial year 2017 , however , the DoD reimbursement for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour .	-12.6901
Unity records are recorded as 30 minutes from the home base of Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-18.7624
The White House argues that the actual costs of helicopter operation are well below this rate .	-2.4378
" The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-2.8894
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means " .	-13.6221
According to a 2015 RAND study , refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .	-3.5124
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.5185
" The idea is to present things made in America this week , " Spicer said .	-1.9475
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people , are dependent on it .	-2.5895
And I think that most Americans are proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.5646
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.1941
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he took his tour over the South Lawn for the event , but he became involved in the driver 's seat of a fire-fighter car .	-4.5370
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joined the media over his own fleet of company products .	-2.0465
" I know Sikorsky very good , " said the President , " I have three of them " .	-2.4303

How America can Hurt OMV	-1.6677
Wednesday evening , Donald Trump did not really work when he placed his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against RussiI .	-15.3178
" In his hast to legislate , " Congress packed a few " constitutional regulations , " he appreciated .	-4.3041
The response from Moscow was also sharp as expected , and even Brussels fought against the US incursion .	-4.0443
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-2.9084
Accordingly , since then , investors of domestic OMV have been co-financing , together with other European companies , the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Management of Nord Stream 2 .	-4.3683
The drop backdrop is huge .	-3.0140
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , the official statement of the oil company .	-3.2798
Indeed , Donald Trump itself would have to bring sanctions to life by executive order .	-2.4701
Twelve weapons are elected to him .	-2.6151
" The press " has looked at which the Group could defend and which could really hurt him .	-3.0609

" The offer also applies in 35 hours support when children stay until 14 hours ' .	-3.5265
46 part-time forces have kitchen service from 1 September : they warm the delivered dishes , complement them with salad , raw fruit and fruit , portion the meal individually , spend the food , clean up and pure the kitchen .	-5.6842

It is also a question of healthy diets and cooking classes .	-3.1173

For the children , too .	-2.1825

This continuity is important for children .	-1.0483
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .	-3.9489
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance , also the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in the press office in comparison with its own region and foreign awarding .	-6.7769

GMB concerns about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-1.9089
A trade union wants to ensure that the Biscuit manufacturer McVitie has a long-term commitment to production in its plant in Glasgow .	-4.1665
GMB Scotland said that the company had silenced about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-2.3440
More than 500 employees work in the work that produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse alongside other products .	-3.8127
McVities owner Pladis said that he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-12.1084
He added that employees and trade union representatives would " learn " as the first " if their activities change .	-2.6812
In a letter to the company 's filial head , GMB Scotland McVitie asked to " express concerns that funding for the modernization of production lines would not be promoted " .	-4.1803
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager on business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns our members deeply .	-3.2989
Generations of families have worked here and workers focus heavily on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-3.8540
Therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , the rising cost of living and the chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a production presence at McVitie .	-3.8669
A spokesman from Pladis said : " The filial leader at Tollcross only yesterday received a letter from GMB Scotland , and the company will respond directly to this because we appreciate the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .	-10.7480
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-2.3522

Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way to the outside , although a source close to the Catalan Board insists that the club has always given its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-4.1256
But was the football world warned by the PSG president of this prospect three years ago ?	-2.0544
When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi , Nasser Al Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players in PSG .	-3.1478
" I am not worried because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-2.6091

The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg domspatzen continues to provide discussions .	-2.6438
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , explained after publication towards the German Press Agency , he expected from the former Regensburg bishop and current cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the embarrassed Pope Benedict XVI . minminisminisof of ministerof the ! of !	-16.3894
It would be very useful for the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret about their own religions or their false assessment of the transactions at the time .	-5.4523
The vatican newspaper Osservatore Romano , on the other hand , criticised the fact that the reporting on violence in the domestic spats would be measured with ' double standards ' .	-5.1892
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that they are ' harmful and shameful acts ' , which should be punished and prevented in the future ; but striking is the ' degree of media manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the National Bioethics Committee .	-4.8282
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , " Scaraffia writes .	-3.7115
Also , Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis mentioned in the interview with the Bavarian Rundfunk : " You will be happy to go to the church and this is a found feet " .	-5.2778
Moreover , she pointed out that in her youth ' blows were a very normal educational means ' to be finished with friend children as I was one . '	-5.3975
It would be unfair to apply today 's standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.6535
In connection with the reports on abuses , Papst-Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-15.3208
Author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the memory band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-3.6809
" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he values the results of the final report .	-3.2642
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer of Ulrich Weber , which Bistum Regensburg commissioned with the Enlightenment ?	-4.4113
A total of 547 Regensburg domspatzen was sexually abused between 1945 and early 1990 's with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domspatzen .	-3.9129
The final report states that Georg Ratzinger worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : ' Summarizing can therefore be noted that , in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence have been applied by Domkapellmeister R.	-4.5737
Especially in high emotionality , punishment for students could also be more severe .	-3.9929
Nevertheless , unlike many other accusations , many victims estimate the general humanity of R. , and therefore even combine positive memories in many cases , despite violence . "	-4.4251
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger believes it costs .	-4.5518
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the ' incidents of violence in protective warriors at the Regensburg Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.0278
First , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-1.9854
On the other hand , it also appears as cholerists and perfectionist who became handy to the further when a domspatz did not bring top performance .	-4.8976
How do you regard this final report as his biograph ?	-2.1421
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the background , you have to ask yourself more about why the name Georg Ratzinger is in the first at ! ! ! ! !!!!!!!!!!!	-12.0506
It is dedicated to eight pages and it is clearly released by any suspicion of fellow or co-science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.2064
The excesses of violence at school too occurred outside its effectiveness .	-3.6323
He may be accused of learning too late or of not taking first clarifications seriously enough .	-4.6372
The domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was found by virtually all surveys as " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-3.8204
For example , the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger expresses an excellent testimony , describes him as " warmherzig " , " popular " , " competent " and " understanding " , as an extremely good teacher who was regularly supplied with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always removed from grapes of children " .	-5.4544
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality , which has already led to anger .	-2.8733
The fact that he did not only collapse with chairs and the key bundle on the floor , but also distributed ear figs and pulled too friendly boys to the hair or ears , he admitted himself years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for them .	-7.2735
However , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , the 1960s and 1970 ’ s , for parents parents as for parents . parents are part of every of the of !! ! of ! ! ! ! !!!! ! ! ! we	-23.7676
Are you also aware of such injury methods ?	-3.0627
Of course , I think of any of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.0429
I have also seen this in a secular school , a government gymnasium .	-11.6619
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence on school , these are bagatelles .	-4.2672
When asked whether it has to do with his well-known and his role as brother of Benedict XVI , many media have just fallen on him .	-5.5470
On the Bavarian Pope , many who have never understood him are still working hard .	-10.3314
The truth is , however , that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-2.3795
In the media , a great deal has been said about the issue of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-3.1351
Will Georg Ratzinger also burden any involvement or co-science in terms of sexual abuse in the final of the finreport smind ? I	-16.9297
Michael Hesemann : No matter what is now needed .	-3.3920
No one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister .	-2.9389
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-1.2735
" I have never trusted to speak with my father or my mother about it , " an individual said deputy for the others , " I was all very embarrassing .	-4.4595
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is , after all , that most victims remain silent .	-4.1544
If they do not even entrust parents and siblings , then certainly not a choral manager who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in some cases .	-4.9289
How do the domspatzen students assess Ratzinger 's role in terms of cases of abuse    unununa a   una a ununa	-17.8233
Michael Hesemann : A questioned student put it : " With regard to sexual abuse ... I do not see ... a case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had had known in time and could have had the respective perpetrator .	-14.2921
I think it is really absurd to assume that it is always expected ... levels of urgent or clearer opened up , rather than to their parents , boarding heads , confidence teachers , etc .	-6.2403
That one speaks to him about sex ... - unthinkable ' .	-2.1540
For example , the report comes to the very clear result : ' That students entrusted to him in advance and / or the environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation ' .	-4.5909
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of every science .	-2.8639
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or her from being indicated .	-16.0720
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these reluctant crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.1797
In the media there was a lot to read about " violent texts " at the Regensburg domspatzen .	-3.8260
The former Georg Ratzinger domkapellmeister is accused of the Weggauen report .	-3.7895
Does he need to live with this accusation ?	-1.7726
Michael Hesemann : This is the great problem that everything mixed in the reporting has been involved in a huge melange of sexual abuse and force excesses and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger .	-5.0422
But that , in turn , is a misuse of the report .	-2.6380
There are clean separations here : between the pre-school and the gymnasium of dominance , between sexual abuse and force excesses and , let us say , other accusations .	-4.6053
The report also deals with incidents from time to time since 1945 , in other words from four decades where Georg Ratzinger was not the choral head of the dominance .	-5.4803
All the terrible test pedagogy , the cases where cables of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and maltreated , including appalling , all occurred on the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions had to exist .	-6.0666
But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only got the boys face when they were already on the domspatzengymnasium .	-4.2890
On that , as most witnesses emphasize , the issue of " Pre-School " was taboo .	-3.5885
One was happy to escape her and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-2.9413
What different on the domspatzengymnasium ?	-2.5764
Michael Hesemann : There was already discipline , but not a sadistic violence .	-2.5449
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims estimate the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories of it ' .	-4.1514
For example , the accusation of looking away is still high .	-3.6498
But , despite all the efforts , the report was able to define only two periods when it was reported by the states on pre-school .	-4.1337
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so witness ) , and then again in 1993 .	-4.7481
Does Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the conditions ?	-3.3760
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduced .	-2.7369
In this , he points out that ' pre-school continues to practise the caning sentence   '    .   a a a !	-15.5498
In view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-15.9527
That was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was prohibited in Bavaria as criminal punishment for a long time .	-5.0880
Before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us probably knows .	-2.7471
It was difficult to assess where perhaps those affected were exaggerated or dramatised and where the permissible limit was exceeded .	-4.6489
You cannot say that he has always looked away .	-2.7502
That is simply not true .	-1.0212
Only in 1980 was the official abolition of the caning sentence in schools in Bavaria  .    una a a a una !!	-14.0349
After all , Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply the current educational standards to the tiat  a   a a  a a  a !!!!	-15.5381
How do you see that ?	-1.4043
Michael Hesemann : We Historicians are talking about the " case strick of anachronism " , that is , the risk of assessing past after today 's moral standards .	-13.3982
The Principality is already right .	-2.1062
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was horrific at all times and not to what was broken during the pre-school of innocent children ’ s selves , which goes far beyond what usual then .	-6.2064
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being done .	-2.9225
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.7564
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is , ear figs and hairs and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-3.8819
When physical punishment was then forbidden , he also followed strictly on it .	-3.6442
What image of his rainbourg time has Georg Ratzinger played in talks with you for the book " My Brother of Pope " ?	-3.2366
Have the topic of caning also raised ?	-4.1579
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict 's XVI , tells his perspective , because the Domspatzen only played a by-role .	-4.4732
Nevertheless , I certainly do not keep hiding a strict regime there .	-3.9190
However , this must be said : without this perfectionism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would not have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class cultural ambassadors of Europe and of his musical tradition , which had been twice known in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-16.4223
With boilers and bonbons alone , there are no major singers and every success in whatever area , but still discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-5.2281
What kind of people did you see Georg Ratzinger during talks on her book ?	-3.6953
Michael Hesemann : By working on the book and beyond , I have really experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced as beautiful , humorous , fundamental , deep credible and heart-good people who cannot imagine that he could do something about a flight .	-5.4147
I get regularly with how many former domspatzes still remain today , 23 years after his emerition , contact him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of their family .	-4.5524
Those who have not yet forgiven him for having been strict to them , are clearly in the minority .	-4.2069
Most of the dominions are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of mus!	-13.7887
And that he is always a good , father teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a loving respectful person to whom they still look up today and whom they do wor	-13.0300
And please , once again , clearly : everything that accuses him is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time .	-4.6515
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-1.9010
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat .	-2.6289
The evil intention behind it is only too obvious .	-2.7710
The report , which has just been published , relieves it .	-2.2007
Now it would be decency , a 93-year-old man , who has acquired great merits , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , nobody would know the Regensburg domspatze to finally be in peace .	-5.5280
