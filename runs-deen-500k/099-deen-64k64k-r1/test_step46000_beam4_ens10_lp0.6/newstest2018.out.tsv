The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.5897
It is annoying if maps are not up to date .	-2.8606
Everyone who had to get excited because the car Navi stood in a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-6.4065
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlases , an offer of Geolocas Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but for this reason they are very interesting .	-6.1181
Especially when compared to current online maps .	-1.9906
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the nineteenth century in the area of Munich ’ s cultural centre .	-4.9303
The digital Bayerischer Atlas is a patchwork that you cannot see as such .	-5.5742
The large outlines of the SIS have been used for more detailed maps of cities and municipalities , so-called Urkonletter .	-8.3135
This was developed in accordance with the Bayerische Vermessung Manager between 1810 and 1864 and the first surveying of Bavaria .	-7.0606
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.0507
The French army occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.5410
Napoleon wanted to see the occupied country and ordered topographical inclusion of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-5.0771
Although the French troops finally withdrew with the peace of Lunigiana on 9 February 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a largely German-speaking map .	-6.4008
The project was funded by Max IV and the Bavarian Ministry of Messung .	-5.2385
The original location for Munich dates back to 1843 and is like all on the website of the Bavarian National Library .	-4.9905
The comparison used in the past / today is the most impressive example of the country 's capital .	-5.6353
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.9514
One example of this is the sub-ring , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-4.8917
Sendling was incorporated in 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as Munich district .	-5.4133

Where the West Park is today , there is nothing more than fields - at first sight : a smaller card appears with dozens of lines and numbers : hand-printed wheels from the so-called " original " , from which the base tax was derived .	-7.3716
Small plots there today no longer constitute farmers - but small-scale farmers at the " Land in Sun " complex .	-7.0078
A large green area stands north of Untersenching .	-4.5865
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 location of the October Festival , was actually still a meadow in the 19th century and not concrete lowlands .	-6.5215
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.8827
In the original location , in the area of present-day Au-Haidhausen , not only read the street name " at the Gasteig " or the hill " on the fan " - but also in large letters " Unn Institution " .	-8.3855
Yes , here at the Aufeline bypass you once surpassed people .	-7.0664
There was the Munich district error " On the Auer Flues " on the city of Ulm .	-8.9932
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gupfen initiated the creation of a psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Albert II .	-6.2682
" He was progressive in his time , and concluded , for example , the acquisitions of the so-called insane .	-5.0136
In addition , he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Haidhausen , who worked for an exhibition with the Institution .	-5.4855
For 280 patients it was first place , later it extended to 500 places .	-4.2279
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circle circle of illusions in hair .	-6.3997
Since 2006 , Isar-Mamper-Klinik has been ranked as one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrists .	-5.3683
Located on the site of the former Auer Institution , young people meet at the Munich Salesianum .	-5.3756
The order was awarded the building complex 1920 and transformed it into a youth house with training facilities .	-4.7024
To the west lies the TSV München East football pitch , to the east of buildings dating back to the 1980 ’ s .	-5.4392
In 2015 , the “ Casa Bosco ” child house was built in terms of architectural reference to the construction of the insane ’ s origin , which was destroyed during World War II during bombing .	-7.6011
The Marienplatz was listed as the " Hauptplatz " in 1856 , which was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-6.0897
A decisive change in World War II also took place in the heart of Munich .	-3.8564
In December 1944 , the Allied bombs staged many holes in the city centre .	-4.9181
The staff was very friendly and helpful .	-4.6000
The English Institute , small office buildings and a church of the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work and the 5th April 2017 the Spatenschvich were carried out for the second day of the city .	-9.3230
Use the slider to compare the old München-card with today 's aerial image - and fill the gap at the Marienhof .	-4.6607
National Law Group released Warning Travel for Missouri	-4.2659
National Association for the Promotion of Color has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.1595
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for Brazilian travellers , visitors and residents alike to attract special attention when travelling through the state and to exercise extreme caution , as a number of questionable , racist incidents have recently occurred in the entire state and are recorded here " , it is said in the opinion of the group .	-8.9738
A recent adoption law of Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to win crimes of discrimination , and state law enforcement agencies , which are disproportionately targeted at minorities , ordered the group to issue the warning of travel , said NAACP .	-6.4385
" You have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.9235
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed together , " said the President of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-3.3476
" We hear complaints of this frequency that we have not yet heard . "	-2.4271
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a State in the US .	-2.9294
The group cited incidents such as racist crime against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.6332
Sanders died under questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more fuel during his journey through the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri without a crime .	-5.1946
The Council also draws attention to a recent report from the offices of the General Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the state are more frequently detained than white .	-5.4573
" The recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " said chapter .	-3.3641
" People must be prepared whether to bring in compensation for the expenses or to let the relatives know that they travel by the state . "	-5.4764
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime program , which classify the state as the number of such injuries to the 16 rank of the country .	-4.9182
The travel warning is also an answer to a new law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.7082
Before that , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the states had adopted immigration laws , local law enforcement authorities had undertaken to arrest people for immigration attacks , which , in the opinion of the ACCU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-6.4865
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.5797
Weiambience Project is elementary .	-5.8317
The Fischer bacher Weilau project is a success project and will continue next year .	-3.9551
Peter White and Kordula Kovac gave her an image on the ground .	-6.5084
The members of the Fischbacher CDU Local Association , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members , met at the swivel family 's court .	-9.5820
Markus Akordn first provided insights into the operation in which it manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses five holiday guests .	-7.4975
The black forest milk is for him the alternatively marketing route for the milk of his cows , so it .	-5.6469
On the table of the guests , only regional matters come .	-5.8905
Since he is also the leader of Fischbach , he called the Weiher Project a " elementary important " .	-7.1805
I cannot be profitable on such steep surfaces .	-3.2453
A lot of work is needed with the engine sense .	-5.6707
" We have to fight here with the conditions and the topography , " said swivel .	-5.6140
In 2003 he took over parental operations and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not lead to a biooperation .	-4.9564
For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : " The parish has recognized the importance of the Weidling project and is happy about the leadership .	-6.3413
In the case of costs of 3,000 to 4000 euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-4.2580
It is hoped that it could go beyond the afforestation of land for a long time .	-5.3758
" The biggest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate , " the mayor emphasized .	-4.8650
Farmers are often criticised because of the promotion	-4.0620
Over the period of 2013 , 25 plots of 11 participants had been laid down over the mentoring women .	-7.9089
The open area is thus 40 hectares which must not be preserved until at least 2023 .	-5.2751
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half a Leader was promoted , a quarter attended by the Fischer bach community .	-4.7102
Thus , farmers stopped spending 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.2 km of pasty .	-7.2258
" The great advantage is the durability of fences , explained swivel feeders .	-2.7417
Kordula Kovac : " You do a good job without farmers and rural women are not " .	-6.2706
Peter White also said : " The best food is produced here " .	-4.7215
The landscape conservation line ( LPR ) in Baden-Württemberg makes it possible to promote wheat cultivation .	-4.6389
The goal is to keep open the Black Forest .	-2.1117
A support regime called LPR is required .	-3.4805
In addition , the enclosed area must not be a viable one ( more than 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-7.0542
At the time of the Sarajevo Weigenaun project in 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots to build nearly 16 kilometres of fence .	-7.5461
Open area is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-3.2354
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.8266
Now the Trump White House is on the altar of freedom .	-3.1727
The safest sign of regime change is to begin to attack the statues .	-2.6448
Americans appreciate this as much as any other – hence the careful fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firth Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.8643
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump administration , surely knew what he did when he adopted a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta by CNN on the president ’ s proposals for a drastic restriction of legal immigration .	-5.0620
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.2217
A Horde of Bootins and Liberty-Dinists would have dared to defeat him if he had done so .	-5.5604
But he took on its importance , and in particular the importance that she was attributed when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his base .	-5.9841
As Miller Acala argued , " I don 't want to go into a complete story here , but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world plunges .	-5.0229
The poem you refer to was added later , not part of the original statue of freedom .	-6.6031
Miller is factually correct , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-2.9335
It is about the contemporary response to the enlightened words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your mosquitos , your poor , / your afflicted masses who seek to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your coasts " .	-6.8464
There was never a time when the ' waste ' was better visible on our screens .	-2.3790
Miller committed not in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6778
This conflict , because of the importance of a statue , is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-7.8388
Lazarus - and their friends who were trying to put their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they were conducting a highly political act .	-7.2109
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicism by using classical images the female embodiment of freedom .	-4.1650
Lazarus changed this significance : In her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-2.9449
And they themselves have a very different name : Mother of exile .	-3.7254
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.0679
And just like Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .	-4.5267
The great cry , Rush Limburg , a kind of John of the publisher for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that freedom statue does not invite anyone , but rather an early neoconservatives who put the American flame into the world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-7.7884
It is intended to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-1.9330
The flag is not to lay the way into the United States . "	-4.4817
That is what was unusual in that part of Limburg .	-5.5066
The significance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception .	-2.4442
The great imagination of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , but hopeful people after long and often awful trips on the decks of ships .	-6.0763
It is literally about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.6771
Your statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they have to hear .	-2.3863
Of course , that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump always want to recognize .	-3.0222
Her torkel is meant to unify not the path , but the hatred that is its only source of power .	-5.2384
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scotland ’ s Team .	-4.8105
Eilat Doyle is reminded of a time when only two Scots belong to the UK team .	-3.5735
The director of the United Kingdom ’ s athletics practice , Neil Black , says that the 16-year-old Scottish quota at the World Cup will make a massive contribution to the team .	-6.8418
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017 , which will be on Friday .	-2.8480
Black believes that ' something special is being developed in Scotland ' and the UK 's circular sports must learn from it .	-6.0182
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , " said Black .	-4.0770
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.7456
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5168
British Track & Field : It has something to do with what they have done .	-3.3846
And also with the type of road corner .	-3.1911
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.8168
Several of the Scottish athletes are the medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , which will run on the 5,000 metre course against Sir Mo Farah , while Eilat Doyle was elected by the team as the team 's captain .	-6.3747
" Eilat is fairly modest .	-2.2748
Your chapter speech was incredibly ' , says Black .	-2.4484
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated .	-4.4728
The passion and the real feeling , that obviously brought hell was great . "	-5.4898
The Commonwealth Games Winner who will compete with the 400-metre obstacles at their fifth World Cup wins says it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.1292
Scotland ’ s highest number of athletes at the World Cup has been seven , reaching 1983 and 2015 .	-4.5944
Muir , the capital of Ecuador , has established five British and two European records last year .	-5.0872
They will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m in total .	-4.4460
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scotsman who should observe after a great season that included the victory of the British team of Trials and the Julian Games .	-5.6752
Doyle reminds her of her first world championships , when the only other Scottish team was Lee McConnell .	-5.4491
The team news polls say that they are " deeply proud " of the fact that many of their countrymen are not only members of the team , but in some cases they are also associated with the medals and finals .	-6.6531
" The special thing about team captain is that she was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , makes it a very special case for me " , she added .	-5.6310
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.7698
It only shows how far we have come .	-2.0665
And they are here as an established athletes , athletes who want to climb at Podien .	-4.9583
With regard to my speech as a chapter ?	-2.7316
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.6352
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home World Cup .	-3.7068
So it is really important to put this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.4341
I get a second chance to go there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . "	-4.0772
Block critics over Facebook : Do not care for a public office if you cannot heat up voters .	-4.5256
The father of our country knew a little bad press .	-1.9309
The Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-3.4878
He roused at criticism , certain .	-4.3906
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.0416
In 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and blunt , we are being fought like sheep for slaughter ' .	-4.6873
That brings me to Maryland ’ s governor , Larry Hogan , who has to work to be more like Washington .	-2.5133
Hoan ’ s employees blocked contributions from at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-4.0781
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week .	-2.9193
The Board of Directors dismissed the complaint as a frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.7823
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-1.5885
But it is important .	-0.8209
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hoogan .	-3.4278
This is a Republican governor in a overwhelmingly democratic state that is remarkably popular .	-2.2434
It has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.8877
Hogan is not a reactionary hot topic .	-2.4692
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to principles .	-3.1295
He was also very clever to use Facebook as a primary means to connect with his constituents and to debut his tired head of chemotherapy on his side .	-4.3696
That is why the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is officially called , and who are paid for by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.4156
In an interview with The Washington Post , Judge Amelia Chassen defended the actions of the governor , arguing that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a facilitator .	-4.0720
But it is too easy to use the image of Trollen or Spam or hateful people who online the whip rhythm .	-4.3682
The Post spoke to some of the real people blocked by hook .	-3.0284
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a priest , no trolls .	-3.6350
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not in-depth .	-2.2458
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and called upon upon the Catholic faith of slogans .	-5.1588
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramni of Bowie , MK , was not hateful , but she asked for hate crimes .	-3.9725
" I commented polite that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary section of the message " The Post " .	-2.6584
" I do not value this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some people are being ignored as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected by it . "	-7.7810
What the governor 's staff called " concentrated spam attack " would probably call others " foster " .	-5.6121
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment .	-2.9221
It is much cleaner than in previous times , if you had done the same thing , that people were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles , or arrest and silence demonstrators .	-6.0653
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.5084
Hogan is not the first public officer to be criticized for using Facebook and other social media .	-3.0972
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter hit .	-2.0981
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-2.3349
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment , according to US judges James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when they were voters of their Facebook page .	-5.7537
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-3.6927
That should not be so difficult .	-1.9070
At the time of Washington , the age of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet .	-2.5017
The number of newspapers spread between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters proposed his leadership .	-3.5236
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-0.8380
The people who used Tor as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .	-4.4118
Petitions that criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity , Trade and shipping with Britain were overwhelmed by his office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project 's Online Papers .	-4.7323
But he has not silenced them .	-1.7384
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation .	-2.3049
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.4232

Fewer lung cancer through passive smoking	-4.6275
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking .	-2.5371
This results from scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) in a study .	-4.4510
" According to our estimates , 167 cases of lung cancer are due to passive smoking per year , " said Akko Becher 's head of .	-4.6670
As a comparison , he used his own study on the 1994 issue .	-3.3038

In 2015 alone , Freeport accounted for $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-2.6460
Moreover , Papua has wood resources worth an estimated USD 78 billion .	-2.7275

The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements , but there are processes that have to be overcome , " he said .	-3.5117
Then Wiranto made a retreat when , on 5 June in Jakarta , he spoke to TIME and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-5.8982
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-1.7975
He was arrested by the UN for crimes against humanity , who claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor ’ s bloody independence vote in 1999 , saying that 11 cases of human rights abuses have already been resolved in Papua , including the Panama case .	-5.5171

" I hid two days in my house " .	-1.9353
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers to be accountable and to withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the area .	-3.8998
Paniai has always been a disgrace for the Indonesian Government .	-3.0071
Lack of rational development will strengthen discontent between tribal men , mec , Dani and Damal , living in the green region of Papua .	-6.4679
Many of them joined the Free Papua-Bewegung ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by adopting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-5.1125
Some of the top OPM guides come from Paniai , including the LOMINI and Daniel Yuthe Kogoya .	-5.8496
In recent years , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested , on the pretext of ' securing national sovereignty ' .	-3.4768
Some are never appearing again .	-1.9618
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.7970
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.0819
The little bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-3.8948

They keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest are sold on the local market .	-3.0988
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.4422
Over time , economic disparities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants , who have risen to greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport .	-5.3440
The few jobs there are in the region are usually those of the more educated and wealthy migrants .	-3.9407
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to make its own businesses competitive .	-3.6128
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , " says John Gobai , the leader of the council of Paniai .	-3.6164
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world distant from Papua .	-3.5298
Moreover , restrictions on reporting international media remain tense .	-1.9322
At the beginning of the year , French journalists , Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp , were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , although they were given rare permission to film .	-5.0079
According to Phelps Kine , the deputy director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowis ’ s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development were not realized .	-4.3341
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report by Indonesia 's restless provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.9678
Poor press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely confined to Papuas 's immediate neighbours .	-3.2622
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvaluable , Marshall Allied and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread injuries ' in Papua , including the Panii-shooting .	-5.2230
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.2902
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Arratha Nasir , accused the group of accusations and said in Jakarta : " In Indonesia there is still a democratic system , and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases " .	-6.6539
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.5100
As an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the direction of the human rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura visited on 4 May , local residents killed their silence and arrested him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also attended the meeting but wishes to remain anonymous .	-6.5206
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua is unlikely to vote again for Jokowi .	-3.5055
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in Panii-Schüssen , " says Gobai , the leader of the tribal council .	-3.6281
He wants Jokowi to know that the Panama people , apart from the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-5.4400
Gobai says that the Panama people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jokowi as a " blame " he has to pay back .	-4.3472
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.0534
Despite threats and intimidation , family members of the Paniai firing resulted in a final symbolic act of the mortal charge : the body of a victim was buried on a terrain precisely in front of the police and the military station .	-7.0023
You know that they may never have justice , but at least let those responsible not forget their crimes .	-3.5975
" A member of our family was killed " , says Yasobus with a warm head .	-3.7639
" What else can we do ? "	-1.4523
Fire capture the ' Torch ' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time .	-2.7737
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world ’ s tallest residential towers in Dubai and forced hundreds of residents to flee from 337 m high , 79story buildings .	-6.0463
It is the second fire which , in just two years ' time , feeds through the high house called the Torch Tower ( Fackel-Tower ) .	-6.3074
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.2403
" We have slept on fire alarm and on the cries of the people .	-4.7265
We settled down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50 floor " , a resident who called George angab , Reuters .	-7.0746
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units would delete the fire and freeze the building against 4 a.m. local time ( midnight GMT ) .	-6.3542
The government said that it is working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-2.6756
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high buildings around the world .	-3.6056
An examination by the management of the Tor building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage occurred from the fences , the outside panels for decoration or isolation .	-6.3105
In the UK , the police said that the system of panels for isolation and fixing on the London Grenfell tower could have contributed in June to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .	-5.5502
No Davis-Cup reform : Next Best of Five .	-6.2889
The President of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has been met with his large Davis-Cup coupon at the General Assembly .	-4.5084
At the meeting in Ho-Minh-City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary decision to play Davis-Cup-single only on two winning sentences was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-5.1935
This is often very long , but also highly esteemed five-a-cat classic , which is why the traditional contest will be retained .	-9.3784
So , 63.54 % of the Member States voted for the reform , the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was barely missed .	-5.0574
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup .	-2.7667
We need a change to ensure the long-term future of this iconic and historic contests , " said Haggerity .	-2.8723
You will continue to work to improve the game .	-3.0067
After many objections , Garm was not the first to vote before the proposal to wear the final in a neutral place .	-6.0598
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will now have host rights in the first round in the next year .	-5.9140
In order to reduce the costs for the organisers , the training courses and so on will be made easier and the players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-6.5494
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers will bring prohibited items to the plane , a survey will take place .	-4.1658
A survey of aircraft operations showed that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items were smuggling at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % of which entered the aircraft while inadvertently wearing prohibited blades or other items with Klingen .	-7.5963
Less than 1 % claimed that they were belatedly discovered that they went wrong with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.9738
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet debt service , Stratos Jet Charter Inc . - also noted that younger travellers tend to ignore the rules .	-5.6754
Among the respondents who admit that they deliberately tried to fly with something forbidden by TSA , 19.7 % were Millennials , compared to less than 15 % that were members of the generation X .	-5.6979
The most common items items deliberately dumped by TSA agents were foods and liquids .	-4.0830
More than 3 % claimed to have profited objects of safety by blade , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately introduced prohibited drugs into the plane .	-7.1697
The company said that travellers across the country were asking for information on how many accidental smuggling products had been brought through airport security and how many people had deliberately done it .	-6.4186
It is no surprise that the people who , most accurately or unwittingly , have been through safety were those who fly most often .	-5.7683
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.7423
People are often unsure which fluids may bring them or how much of it .	-3.7076
So it is no surprise that the biggest amount of liquid confiscated by TSA are .	-4.6819
For a while , people who saw TSA could view books as smuggling .	-5.0463
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .	-1.6570
Elon Musk ’ s case is no matter : tens of thousands of cartoonists cancel Order .	-4.8774
One of the most important features of the FIFA World Cup is the FIFA World Cup .	-7.9964
He has so far rejected that part of the customer has already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-5.1258
In addition to the ever triumph of sales increases and even gigantic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk , for the first time , announced the most recent quarterly balance sheet , has delivered a different , less brilliant figure : the cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-9.0996
Musk had often campaigned for the new car over the past few months with more than 500,000 preliminary orders .	-5.7674
Now , Musk grants : Of the total of 518.000 preliminary descriptions , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-4.7735
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that they are merely a non-binding reservation .	-4.4216
In case of cancellation Tesla will pay the € 1000 ( in the United States $ 1000 and <unk> 1000 in the UK ) " booking money " in full .	-6.2059
At the moment 455,000 such nonbinding reservations were made , Musk admitted in a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.3194
However , the Teverson Report does not believe that the cancellation of approximately twelve percent of all orders to date could become problematic .	-11.3597
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-3.1162
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.2973
2018 - all models taken together - 500,000 would be a million , 2020 .	-4.2254
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.2222
According to the Musk , a reservation is now valid per day 1800 .	-5.6060
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " today can expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Temsla manages to drive its brand-new production roads that are never tested in practice without major disruptions to maximum utilisation .	-7.0004
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.3532
If there are too many delays , then the inevitable nature of the reservations could become the problem for Tembur .	-5.1672
After all , companies of dissatisfied customers cannot avoid going away in droves .	-4.5959
EPA-chief Pruitt is retreating because of the failure of the rules of the Obama Era to reduce emissions .	-4.4706
A day after he was sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog with sufficient air pollution .	-5.7623
Pruitt was a change when its agency proved to be the needs of the public authorities in response to reactionary administrations .	-5.7146
He did not refer to the case which had been brought up against his previous post in a federal court of vocational training .	-6.0904
It is a deadline that set for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for ground level ozone .	-4.2452
Pruitt said in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time , study the plan and avoid ' interfering in local decisions or hinder economic growth ' .	-3.8888
Pruitt , who was a public prosecutor of Oklahoma before President Donald Trump ’ s appointment , has long been a reliable opponent of more stringent environmental legislation .	-4.4999
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the fossil-fuel industry are resisting .	-3.6504
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Prutus regulatory rolling back agenda .	-2.9222
Last month , a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA Administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that required oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage .	-4.7809
In an opinion published on Wednesday , Pruitt proposed that its U-turn on ozone standards simply enhances the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.0173
" In previous administrations , the EPA often did not meet the deadlines for carrying out the work and then waited to be charged by activist forces and others , and in an agreement to establish the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-13.9554
" We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.7704
We also take seriously the law and the authority that we have . '	-2.7608
However , the opinion of the EPA said that Pruitt will eventually use its ' power to delay and all other powers available legally , ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on a solid policy and the best available information ' .	-5.4838
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader overhaul of the ozone rules .	-2.6339
A draft law adopted last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.9384
The measure was not yet put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.3064
The New York Attorney General Eric Leap , who chaired the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-4.2143
" The reversal of the EPA - following our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety of these 6.7 million New York citizens and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that goes to their communities , " said cutting edge .	-8.5723
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhodes Island , Vermont , and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-5.9450
Ground ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .	-3.3450
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .	-2.6227
Public health officials and ecologists saw surprising change of course through Prudentism .	-5.4135
" It is worrying how much pressure it needs to take this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe " , said Lorei Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.8728
" We must continue to fight against the Trump administration ’ s ideological crusade to trade for polluters and their particular interests . "	-3.6245

The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the village made friends and promoters Tumlinger their concern .	-5.5940
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique small village .	-3.1520
In 1267 , the St. Hilariuschapel was first mentioned in the Hong Kong Municipal Library : Count Hermann von Sulzz sold the mountain with the adjacent church to Tumlingen and the Vogigi Church at Magster Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 marks .	-8.3531
In addition to the former parish church there was a ruling court , one of which was the church or the right of patronage , and not the other .	-7.7987
There was a lot of people staying there .	-7.0210
As shown in the description of the Upper City of Freudibstadt in 1858 , it was next to the Unterdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the local image of Tumschlag , the " mountain " of the third , the dominant part of the village .	-8.6185

Association wants to check permission for windbicycles	-3.6192
" Boisheim " does not see any legal condition for construction and has therefore written to the county council .	-5.9976
The " Boisheim " association has called LandBoard Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind plants in the Boisheim Netmine .	-8.2761
It is unlawful .	-1.8648
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim of Netting , no wind power plants could have been approved , because at the time of four , only a wind turbine center existed at the city border to the South Stream Valley .	-9.6553
Within this concentration zone construction and operation of wind turbines are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone also prevents the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-5.9105

The state of the art : before the summer break , the city council once again decided to concentrate the wind zone in the Boisheim Nete ; an authorization of the district government is still in place .	-8.1478
Erkens : " In this case , the granting of permission for the construction of wind power plants is legally excluded " .	-5.3776

Forciunas Hoffmann : " three-chain works better " .	-3.7776
Andre Hoffmann after 2 : 2 in the seasonal competition against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defensive information will take place on Aue points .	-6.4505
With the first season , Hoffmann was happy with the result that the two opposite would have been against Braunschweig .	-6.0829
" The opposite was too much , and we need to be more careful in Aue , " says the defense player of Foruna Düsseldorf .	-5.1938
The three chain is to be further optimized in the Erzgebirge region .	-3.6776
And a gate to a free collision no longer wants to recede .	-5.2467
" For the future , it will be like no more to Michael ( Rensing ) take the line . "	-4.8925
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will also be better acquainted with the three chain experiences than with the four team .	-7.8408
" Still I don 't know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelmet Radio , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing " because we have just in the chain of three positions in Kazan Ayhan and Niko foundelmann players who can build well " , said Hoffmann .	-7.0173
" It is a precondition , but that we are even better harmonised and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction . " . , , , , , , , , ,	-6.4515
Hoffmann also manages to gain the game .	-4.3760
" Whether you can speak after a decision about a failed start , however , does not know .	-5.2829
Hoffmann thought that this would be a really nice thing .	-8.7306
" But if we stand four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the Pokal , we will certainly be able to speak of an ordinary seasonal act . "	-5.4356
His coach did not want to know this .	-2.8438
" The start in the season I only judge after six to eight days of play " , said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the match of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a thunderstorm .	-7.5368
" Now they can start the season with a home game " , said Funkel and Hoffmann think that the gamers from Aue might even be somewhat more fresh , because they would not have a difficult and complete game like a push favorite in the bone .	-8.4010
" But they don 't know so 100 % where they are at present , " says the inner defending of the Fortuna .	-4.5741
Although guests from the Rhineland are going to the meeting at long last ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue as .	-6.7160
" That we turn them away , just because we have the right to come under the first six , is meaningless , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is only positive at a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-7.9826
" There is no team in the second Bundesliga to be started " explains Forunas Chief Engineer .	-6.9512
" Such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant " .	-2.4643
And thus Funkel will never see his player on Sunday .	-4.5875
New results of the Swedish asylum age tests are published .	-3.1871
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 % of those who have been tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.2524
The Swedish Regulatory Office for Forensical Medicine ( Schutterich ) started carrying out last year 's tests .	-6.9099
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum process , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration link ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-5.8500
Up to now , migration net has sent up 6.880 cases to test , and the forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2.4 81 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-5.9577
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in more 25 cases the forecast agency was that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-5.4134
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years of age " .	-2.4009
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person 's age is called into question .	-2.5103
According to Johan Görson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results in recent months are consistent .	-3.9150
" We see no great difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.3730
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seekers have lied about their age .	-2.8314
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases which " suggest that the examined person is 18 or older " .	-4.3203
When the Svenska Dagblad examined the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-5.4035
The method of medical age assessment , during X-ray capture of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-6.1983
One skeptics is the endometriologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinka Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people in order to see whether they were usually through puberty sooner or later .	-7.3899
" I had reason to think about it and I do not believe that the kind of measurement should be used .	-2.7538
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.7243
If we cannot say it safely , we should not do so as if we could ' , he told the newspaper metro .	-4.0084
However , Görwarson , defended by the Forensic Medicine Agency the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is insufficient .	-4.9979
The biggest risk is that if the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-4.3602
Complete in the Plan	-1.2721
Work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schamberg is well forward .	-4.0878

On the south part of the bridge a 2,020 m wide bridge is to be installed on Friday .	-4.6815
The pedestrian path is to be found here .	-4.5586
This is especially because they are finished parts , a patent of the Schmierger company Dizwo .	-4.3979
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridge caps .	-2.4987
Particularly at the fingertips , the scarring of lines required by the building in Lauterbach .	-5.8013
Because there is also a glass fibre cable that many firms are connected to .	-3.8075
The surrounding people were informed about the project in the run-up to the work by means of an informal ballot .	-5.7665

It is financed by the country .	-1.8389

It is not so often the case that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , what else is hard to reconcile .	-4.7428
The parties represented by the district council ( CDU , SPD , Greens , German Free Democratic Party , FSG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that , on this day , shows a peaceful flag because the AfD is invited to the big campaign launch in the Geroldteiner Stadthalle Rondell as the poster .	-9.6462

With a view to the event at the Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good law of the people , main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.4126
This is also the case : a band of entertainment at the Rondellvorplatz , in the Stadthalle , various speakers , including the Rhineland Chanter AfD-CEO Uwe .	-9.6509
In the hall there are about 200 people waiting for the top female run for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy Federal Beatrix of Storch to keep their speeches .	-6.9789

The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the system ' , he added .	-3.2856

Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the Cathedral Church of Roskilde .	-2.2038
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgadard already created a coffin for the two .	-3.0872
The queen was in agreement with the decision of her husband , and it continued in the communication .	-4.2202
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-1.8050
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-3.2302
Prince Henrik never made a secret of that he was not happy with his title .	-2.0779
After the ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.3605
In 2016 , he retired , with the title " Prince-Screen " .	-5.3557
Since Henrik Denmark did not get the title and function that he wanted , he does not see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief prosecutor of the Danish royal house .	-6.0535

He worked on the Thames in the French embassy .	-3.4221
In his later wife , however , his love of the people always disappeared , Prince Henrik had a hard stand in his almost 50-year rule in the Danes .	-7.9855
In a autobiography , Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticised .	-3.0941
My Danish was fluctuating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk suits instead of knitting , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-8.5623
Even for the scores that I used instead of Skyia tobacco and those who had the reputation of being more critical of the social brand , I could not hope for indulgence .	-7.4000
I was different .	-0.8945
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed of it .	-3.2313

Because on Friday the House voted for the resolution .	-4.9785
Before that , Premier Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s government had dropped into a severe crisis the immediate exit of a green MEP from her country group in Lower Saxony .	-6.9647

So far , the ratio has been reversed .	-1.6597
The new day of land is regularly chosen on 14 January next year .	-3.4120
Thümler said that the red-green government of Germany should now decide whether it could continue to rule without a majority in this situation .	-3.7129
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day should adopt its own resolutions as soon as possible .	-6.4790
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-6.9183
The country ’ s constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will deprive the Prime Minister of confidence and elect a successor .	-4.5960
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.7656
These possibilities have to be examined legally " , said Thümler .	-3.1361
" We will certainly discuss all issues if they are legally reasonable . "	-5.2871
Thümler called the Tweesten step " yet something curious " .	-4.4434
The politician himself emphasised : " I am not a disclose .	-2.9844
I feel very good ' .	-1.2746
They called themselves a believer in the green .	-4.1035
The Greens wanted the delegates to return their country ’ s mandates .	-4.2386
" Of course , we assume that they will return their parliamentary mandate , which it received through the green list , with immediate effect , " that the head of the State was acting as a kind of Jansen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-10.0753
The chairman of the Green Group , Mr Piel , said : ' We deplore the decision of Elke Tweesten ' .	-4.7312
You have deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the Group .	-2.9235
" Even against the background that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . "	-4.3019
SPD-Kanzler , Martin Schulz condemns the transgressions of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Tweesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-7.0889
" The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters , but also betrayal of Red Green , " the chief of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-4.5559

Exit Tweete costs Rot-Green to the majority in Lower Saxony .	-3.4943
" The politician " in her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country " , criticised SPD-Secretary-General Huersus Heil .	-6.6124
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony shares this dirty intrigue and tries to capitalize on it " .	-4.3237
Björn Thümler , Chairman of the CDU , wants to recommend to his deputies to incorporate Elke Tweesten into the CDU .	-5.4079
The leader of the SPD ’ s parliamentary assembly , Thomas Oppermann , dismissed Tweesten , with personal career considerations , falsifying the outcome of the country ’ s in 2013 .	-6.4687

Minister of Agriculture in the interview - how do we protect ourselves from toxic invaders , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.2194
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.7479
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.6867
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.6282
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) talks and answer in the interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-3.7504
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-2.7377
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .	-3.3505
On the Food Alert website .	-3.9157
affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-0.8991
Even though , as we know at present , health risks are practically eliminated .	-3.9368
Now Alfi picks up the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the performer is not really recognized by the Federal Ministry of Economy ?	-6.2756
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states .	-3.1653
Nevertheless , my house has moved on without delay and has since become known the guilty of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .	-6.4053
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.8297
Trade , just like the manufacturers , must ensure that products sold are safe in transport and in health .	-4.9387
If the maximum residue content of 0,005mg / kg is exceeded on eggs , it is not transportable .	-4.7525
Uncharged eggs can nevertheless be sold and consumed .	-2.2198
This time , farms are not to blame .	-1.5467
Are manufacturing facilities and consumers in the same boat ?	-3.2388
At present , production companies are not directly responsible .	-4.6313
Instead , they must face economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .	-3.0843
As always , in the worst case , there are too few inspectors .	-4.5613
What is the difference between the staff and the coherent competence ?	-5.1798
It was the official controls which revealed the situation .	-3.7663
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-3.3604
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the handing over to the public authorities is of crucial importance in the cases where criminal offences are available .	-6.6632
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the authorities to be fully informed .	-4.0479
Is regular alarms really necessary in food scandals ?	-1.5648
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and affordable food .	-3.7175
When non-authorised insecticides are used in food industries , consumers are rightly outraged .	-4.1211
This is a good way of getting manufacturers , retailers and consumers in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .	-4.9524
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the herbicide Fipronil in relation to the attitude of lifegiving animals is unacceptable and must be stopped immediately .	-6.9120
This must be done consistently and with high pressure on all levels .	-3.9746
I expect all the competent authorities to speed up and resolve the situation .	-3.4644
As the financial rules of the footballs on the move to Paris .	-6.1467
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from European football clubs will not disrupt the World Record transfer from Spain to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-5.2805
Any consequences will come to Paris Saint-Germain from UEFA , because the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to prohibit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-5.0379
Financial fairness rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must at some point prove that the transfer of Colmar was financed without much loss .	-5.8090
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to purchase Hong Kong from its treaty , and Colmar will receive a salary that will amount to several $ 10 million a year .	-4.9789
Here are some of the financial aspects of remark moving to France .	-2.7713
PSG can certainly make the money loose so that Nemar sticks out and put it into another galaxy , given the financing of the team through the power of the ruling family of Qatar .	-7.2802
Clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but have to deal with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to take the Break-Evin point in their business based on football .	-7.1074
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the continental President in 2007 .	-4.9885
Former French players believed that clubs who had taken huge debts in their quest for success would effectively cheat and risk destroying themselves when banks or owners repatriate their support .	-5.3370
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentration on the clubs ’ debts to monitoring their losses .	-2.9965
The change meant that the business model , which Roman Abramovivich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand , should become a stronger matter .	-4.6769
During the current three-year accounting period running until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-4.3136
And although platinum fell from the presidency in 2015 , its conversion to Aleksander Ceferner continues to favor excessive spending .	-7.0291

The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the Champions League would remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-5.7125
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to list their financial supervision by boosting their revenues from companies connected with the owners of a club .	-5.0709
Whereas a Julian company could sponsor PSG clubs if the value of sponsorship was to exceed standard market assets , UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income .	-6.5097
That is exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA 's sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-4.3315
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments could come to Colmar about payments from the organization committee of the World Cup 2022 in Qatar .	-4.1686
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Nemar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre could easily be found for the UEFA regulators .	-6.5900
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.9668
UEFA did not have any preparatory discussions with PSG on HR transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.9992
You spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.6685
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has achieved more than EUR 10 million .	-3.5048
The accounts for the last financial year still need to be published .	-2.3009
Please note that Nefaring 's arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandise sales and trilisted sales .	-7.5169
The association assumes that after signing , sales will increase by at least 30 percent .	-3.5453
The Spanish League was clearly irritated that one of the best football players went to see , and she tried to prevent Nefaring move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-5.6665
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS regarding the latter owner of PSG .	-4.3069
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports Tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club .	-3.1688

Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " North-West Switzerland " on 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around 1 billion francs .	-5.7032
But it is more important to have the effect of advertising : it is a privileged order for a young man to do so .	-8.1079
The Swiss does not want to betray the number of applicants involved in the new tender .	-5.2492
However , only Swiss manufacturers are questioning this .	-3.8685
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wishes to seek a renewal of the treaty over the spring of 2018 .	-3.5864
For the above , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-3.3459
Swiss have been distributing chocolate posters on board their flights since 2006 .	-2.9345

Nostalgia goes into the Nische in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " .	-3.9463
This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic for the glorious days of the 80 ’ s characters , for the 90-year-old Grunge-era ( when the prophets David Wain and Michael Showage raised the Sketch characters ' The State ' for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , 2001 , before their stars , such as Banks Elizabeth , Amy Pohler and Paul Rudd went to larger things .	-8.2168
As cultural artifacts , it is also a parody and an embodiment of our face capable era of permanent memory .	-4.9140
But as a franchise for Costasur it feels like time is running out .	-2.4417
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contained a original story for a talking can vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.4303
By hanging at the core of the Gag - actors of middle age play horny children who grow up - they nonetheless failed to regain the last part of the play .	-7.1248
" Ten Years Straer " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody is more closely rooted in the formation principle , including a Riff on the stalactite calendars of the 1990s such as " The hand That rock the Cradle " ( " The hand , the swing , the cradle " ) .	-10.7693
On one point there was a character through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skaters and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.7683

The amiable Coop ( Mr. Showage ) , now author Romaner , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.2739
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its virginity .	-2.2233
And there is another crazy plot in which Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. showold ) is included , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a familiar impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-5.6775
As always , excursion is the best part of a franchise .	-1.9064
It is a great pleasure to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillons Unterhalibut of " singles " , whose former Big Manson camp feels like an old boy .	-6.4752
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of recurrent " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I consider to be his logical conclusion : " wet Hot American Summer : Twead Yet Later " , whose last scene will show the band how she will visit the movie premiere of " Wet American Summer " .	-6.8299
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonds " and even " GLOW " with its East-West Ringtheme iconography .	-6.5426
The comedy set up by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as director , establishes a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth , atheism and the way of Marxism / Leninism .	-5.4859
The main roles - a hard-earned Gregor and an idealist Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are dubbed by the channel Tatum ( also a sophisticated producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levi in English .	-6.6160
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.5854
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.1827
There are some nice gags for prestige ( the police spend the time watching television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-4.5068
And the list of famous speakers - including Jeny Slte , Nick Offertner , Maherhala Ali and Cho<unk> Sevigny - creates a decent game ' Find out the Voice ' .	-5.4905
But " Combrade detection " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer with a Reagan-mask is involved - that it often plays like a single .	-5.8736
There are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-3.6652
" Comrade Detective " , which was edited on a lower length , could provide its Agitprop-Satire better , since Gregor and Ivosef always visit the American message whose lobby is always occupied by two huge men , who devour a bunch of hammers .	-7.2074
The message to the imagined Communist public is that Western culture can make everything feed for a vow .	-3.7541
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong : we are doing it with our own younger history and theirs .	-4.2161

Since summer 2016 the Public Prosecutor 's Office Konstanz has been investigating the organised drug trafficking in the southern German region .	-5.1669
There was a regular exchange between the public prosecutor in Konstanz and Palermo , and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.7945
Therefore , the large-scale deployment on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-3.7223
In particular , it is the aim of the investigation of Italian citizens with close ties to the Italian Mafia .	-5.6351
An incident on 27 May , too , at the time of the morning several shots were fired into a restaurant , should go to the tour account .	-6.2261
Large gaps in the country register	-3.7702
" Data from citizens who should not be appearing here " : according to a report , the country register in Germany has considerable shortcomings .	-4.9024
This partly leads to serious misdecisions on asylum procedures .	-4.4924
The Representative for the Government 's Refugee Management , Mr Frank-Jürgen , has drawn attention to a media report to large gaps in the country 's central register .	-5.6907
shortcomings in the data that are registered there could lead to a partial failure in asylum procedures and expulsions , warning in an analysis submitted by the " Süddeutsche Zeitung " .	-6.8770
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are registered , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.9261
The data will therefore be managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.5269
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of data has not been good in parts to date .	-4.5107
In individual cases , data had been found by 1921 , " by people who have long ceased to be alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register " .	-5.6723
" Flable data transfers can significantly slow back processes , " says the report .	-4.4287
In statistics on returning people , moreover , EU citizens who do not need to travel should be covered .	-7.7701
Such false grants , however , led to a distorted debate about how to deal with exit packages , so it is in the analysis .	-6.5184
Meanwhile , the German government has apparently begun to return to Italy with the families of refugees under 16 years of age when they have arrived .	-6.0561
This emerges from an internal document from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the New Osnabrück Newspaper .	-4.4686
In the paper it says that the BAMF procedure ' concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - has returned to Italy since 1 June 2017 .	-4.8623
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , as the newspaper pointed to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.8424
After the Dublin agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first .	-3.9277
If an immigrant goes on to another EU country , that state may return it to the country in question .	-4.8343
In the explanatory statement , the office now reads : ' Meanwhile , absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy ' has increased significantly .	-5.0168
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.5149
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( EGR ) considers these pledges sufficient .	-3.4121
Other EU countries would also be sending refugees back there within the framework of the Dublin . the of , , , and the , , , , , , , ,	-5.9065
The domestic spokeswoman of the left-wing group in parliament , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : ' families with children threaten human rights conditions and threats to children ' because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system .	-7.2315
The second best result achieved	-2.3234
In total , a total of 220 litres of blood in Oberenenbach persons already provided blood supply for other people .	-5.6532
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-2.7691
All in all , Jürgen Greule , who now gave 100 donations over 50 litres of blood .	-4.7517
Traditionally , during the municipal council meeting , the municipal council attaches a multiple willingness to donate blood .	-5.5266
" It is wonderful how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the people who make their blood available to strangers , to make it even more entertaining " , Mayor Karheinz Kistner .	-7.8346
" A single donation helps several people " , explained by the managing director of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , for the conservatives are being split into their components .	-5.4440
Three people could benefit from blood donations .	-2.5834
At the same time , Maienacher reported the actions that are carried out in Oberselenbach in spring .	-5.0596
" This year , we reached the second-best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK team administrator .	-4.8222
Apparently , the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-3.2314
Already before that , Thomas Bockstad , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Irberberberberl were among the multiple donors and were awarded 50 per person donations .	-7.6900
So many of them take Herbert Mair and Doree Rixinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten times per 500 milliliters of their life record .	-5.4544
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 % .	-1.3459
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation have pivoted speculation about rising .	-4.3034
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it applied interest rates on family incomes in the midst of growing pressure .	-3.5955
The Bank ’ s policy makers ( MPC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to keep interest rates at 0.25 % this month , with fewer members expected to rise , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-5.8042
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth projections for 2017 to 1.7 % , and for 2018 to 1.6 % , and warned that the pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just 3 % in the autumn .	-3.9471
But they signaled that in the next few years , interest-rate hikes would be needed to rein in the wake of the Brexit fueled inflation , and she said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-6.0533
The Members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth package that was issued a year after Brexit .	-4.2042
It will call for time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper financial resources to banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide <unk> 15 billion more within the framework of this system - at <unk> 115 billion of pounds .	-6.0854
Just minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the central forecast of the MPC , GDP remains low in the short term , because the pressure on real household incomes continues to be strained by consumption . "	-5.9768
On the interest rates , they reiterated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' rate than markets would expect .	-4.7255
The markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.7651
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " progressive " and " limited " .	-2.7147
The Bank ’ s post-adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-3.7963
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.0064
The pound fell after the dollar and the euro .	-3.2458
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-2.2983
The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have weighed down rising expectations for an increase in interest rates , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the second quarter in the previous three months to 0.3 % .	-5.3110
Growth is expected to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will be easy to recover after the bank ’ s end of the year .	-4.4125
The latest inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases , because the tightening will be even worse first before it will improve .	-6.0002
She added that monetary policy could not " prevent " a drop in income in the next few years , " but she added that wages will " recover significantly " at the end of their three-year forecasts .	-7.1499
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , owing to the weakness of the pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-3.9135
The decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s decline .	-3.5101
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years before this will fully achieve prices and the economy .	-3.6883
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the reputation for an increase in interest rates was higher , as inflation increased the pressure on severely burdened households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-5.2872
Inflation dropped from 2.9 % last month in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that this was expected and will resume it in the coming months .	-4.2070
The Bank said that the excess relative to its 2 % target was " quite " to the weak pound .	-4.5427
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " In the recent decline in the interest rate , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are clamouring for business and wish to end the year in a positive way .	-6.3684
The market looks particularly good for those who end the existing deals and sign new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming more and more popular .	-7.1690
NHS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to deploy 10,000 people with HIV disputed drug .	-3.2957
Patients will receive access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatments from September after a fight before the High Court against the financing of the drugs in the NHS .	-4.3223
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection for high risk patients by about 86 % , is now supplied by the health service through a first three year study of estimated 10,000 people .	-6.4627
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal had confirmed last year ’ s Supreme Court judgment that the NHS had the power to pay for the European Parliament , despite the claim that the local authorities should finance it .	-5.0284
The action announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS Englew-head Simon Stevens as ' important new intervention ' while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a ' decisive moment ' .	-5.9979
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.5144
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex in order to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-4.0381
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission at infection risk .	-2.4169
Taking advantage of early sexual intercourse means that only enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-4.8669
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before intercourse .	-3.1723
Those who are in question for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexual and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-4.1370
In clinics , suitable participants will be identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transnational and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not famously controlled by anti-retroviral treatment .	-7.6346
People who live in England and have registered with the practitioner can also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-4.0387
The programme is signed a contract for the delivery of medicines this week after international competitive supply .	-4.7830
The study is intended to evaluate the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as set out , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-6.0848
Stevens said : ' This great new intervention should complement and surpass the wide-ranging and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.3866
It is another milestone in the progress that has been made over three decades in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind . "	-4.3056
Gold prints , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-4.6531
If it is targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , it is possible to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.2850
From September to September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-sponsored attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will improve many lives .	-6.0274
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.6859
Ian Green , the chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority now is to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that nobody who has a risk to HIV is left out .	-5.2054
Now that the European Union has been issued with test medicine , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-7.4862
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the European process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and painful implementation by the government .	-5.4848
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop transmission of this life-threatening infection .	-2.9625
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.5572
Now it is important that this study be carried out as soon as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-5.5230
Living the great life : intermediate level and clever designer tricks have transformed these small Earls Court apartment into a spacious home .	-4.3733
Joanne Leigh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , fell from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2014 .	-3.6703
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not hide and sell her bags .	-3.9769
" Before that I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-4.6867
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-1.8888
I found this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.6122
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . '	-2.5898
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely outdated .	-3.0448
Originally a one-room-house with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne wanted to add closet space and an intermediary floor to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling .	-5.2225
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , much light .	-1.7111
That was my request ' , she says .	-2.0225
For this purpose , she commissioned the architects and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for iod .	-5.7251
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces on top of each other so that the architectural challenge was to create a intermediate level in which one could stand .	-4.5449
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-1.8398
" The steel factory is rather complicated " , he explains .	-2.5518
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were lying on top of each other without having to tear us down .	-6.8367
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of establishing the steel so that he had the right height at the top or down . '	-5.6462
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms at full height alongside one - with a much additional drama .	-5.0566
For the intermediate level , a classic copper light window from retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area .	-4.5413
Locked gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Sergey Mousille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.9048
The use of mirrors plays a role in addition to theater , space and light .	-3.7886
At both ends a quick corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-3.1870
The kitchen mirrors like a window in another room .	-3.6965
At the entrance , units that have a mirrored seat for all corners and glasses by Joanne .	-6.0769
By the perception of a glamorous room , the beauty of the apartment can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.7352
There is nothing new about Jockable kitchens .	-4.1224
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.6183
" A little bit of engineering went there , " explains Erfan of reinforced steel , furnized MDF door .	-4.9533
" It is a matter of weight so that , if you hold the door high , it is very easy to slip . "	-6.4997
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to gain 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout . , , , and the , , , and , , , , , , , ,	-7.1553
" At the end of the day you will sell the property - or how your property is appreciated " , says Erfan .	-2.9491
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will stand up and calculate based on the size of the ground . "	-4.3780
Here they have managed to increase the floor surface while also using high-quality materials that provide the space with a luxurious advantage .	-6.4073
" The materials are the things you touch and help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.1581
" You will not fall into the electrical sockets in the walls .	-3.3970
They are important , but they don 't play with your heart . "	-2.3058
It shows that a flat can be transformed by good design and increased square meters from some default to something very amazing .	-4.5679
Indeed , like Josanne , you could choose not to leave them .	-2.7207
brothers are fighting for $ 500 million in real estate .	-4.2661
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in an argument because of one of the largest property imperial in Victoria , worth over $ 500 million .	-6.2479
The former director of the ' Carlton-ball club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors away from his latest brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to share their property and assets .	-4.8542
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp argument about separation takes place at the Supreme Court .	-4.1313
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-4.1036
The Westco jeans family grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.1632
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-0.8495
This money has been invested in real estate , and De Lutis 's portfolio now includes offices in the town centre , the development areas of Brunei and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Buller and shopping centres in the city of Vorstadt .	-5.5609
After an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main manager and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of company wealth and Paul about one third .	-4.9408
A court act claims that this means that Colin has ownership of $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-4.3543
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.6792
" The announcements suggested by Colin had left him with what I thought for the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidvit .	-5.2104
Last Friday , after several failed mediation , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-1.5734
The brothers are now also fighting to control the current business - of course Colin , as Paul claims , excluded him .	-5.1583
Colin argues that this is not true , but throws Paul to manage some ownership incompetent .	-3.3407
In an early Affidvit filed by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-3.1951
" My Italian heritage says that the family is the most important priority " , he wrote .	-3.2218
The costs rise in the case of hundreds of pages with Affidvits , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myller , QC , and lawyers held by both sides .	-5.5216
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants , the dairy bars and the delicacy of the late 1950-s and bought a shop in Brunchck in the early seventies .	-5.8096
You used the security to buy the Collingwood wine cellar , where Colin opened the first Jewry for the family .	-5.6923
Colin says that he began there when he was " in my last years of high school when Paul was another small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-4.3545
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with her sons on an amicable basis .	-3.4518
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-2.0396
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that Mark paid $ 10 million when leaving the company and Luke 26 million dollars .	-4.2616
As both Lukas and Mark were said , Paul said " about the conditions of their financial separation became embittered " .	-5.6326
Colin remained very restrained , though he was a former AFL board member and after a biography in 2015 by Edden McGuire the best friend of the TV star .	-4.9688
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.5790
Only Colin replied by SMS to say ' I really cannot say much ' because the case is before the courts .	-3.0586
" It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and drag our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.1612
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-2.3264
" Our father did not want Paul and I would end in our current dispute , " he said , and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.4852
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-1.7428
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future " , wrote Colin .	-2.7636
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.8612
Others tried and failed .	-1.5419
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so .	-2.1012
If so , he will be the first .	-1.0049
Political reports show that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to reduce the flow of information to President Trump , including reports by the news media , in the hope of keeping the head on a more equal course .	-5.0773
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-2.0419
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House chief of staff , met with senior staff at his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he would like to repair : poor information coming into the hands of the President .	-4.8096
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in correspondence - because the president would make better decisions if he were to receive good information . '	-6.9124
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media expertise .	-2.2599
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades - and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.7620
" When candidate Trump was angry about an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts to convince , " the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said in February about politics .	-5.4000
Policymakers Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady price of praise . "	-4.8985
Okay .	-1.1526
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been " under control " is laughable .	-2.8792
Perhaps these campaign bosses know something else we do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have included even more detonators without their interventions .	-6.0275
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.9890
If his staff managed to keep him in trouble , then their efforts were worthwhile .	-5.0431
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from creating controversy .	-3.3889
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.2983
Political - quite concerned with this story - reported in May about the preference of advisers to give the President dubious information for strategic reasons .	-5.8714
This was an example described by reporters Shane Goldmacher :	-1.9979
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump , like a volcano , can respond to negative press releases , especially those with damaging leak , and that he can determine where they come from .	-5.3343
That is exactly what happened at the end of February , when somebody in bad faith gave the President a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy king Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a mob of leaks " in the White House .	-6.4043
Although Johnson was banned from Twitter for a long time , or that he had not offered any concrete evidence , or that he made false accusations in the past and revoked them .	-6.3933
Trump read the article and began to ask employees about Walsh . "	-3.0990
Goldlers added that the former chief of staff Reince Pribus and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram received by Trump .	-5.2222
How did it work ?	-1.3745
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .	-1.1401
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager , but Trump is still his impulsiveness , and his advisers still seek influence .	-4.0074
Both factors make Kellys ’ mission very difficult .	-3.0184
Most criminals get post of Europol	-2.4181
As the address is unknown , the people are asked for and hoped for it .	-4.8309
Police across Europe are sending postcards to dangerous criminals this summer .	-3.4780
As the addresses of the heavy criminals in question are not naturally known , public statements are being hoped and sought .	-6.4950
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the " EU Most Wanted " calendar of winter .	-2.6072
Experience would have shown that many volatile tourist destinations are hidden in Europol .	-5.8102

Travellers are negotiating a ditch and return to the ' millionaires ' line .	-4.9536
Some of the West Midlands ’ s most prosperous house owners are again at war feet with some determined travellers who negotiated a villager to demand a field back in front of their manor houses .	-6.6902
The travellers have their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street called the " millionaire series " .	-6.8115
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters before they were thrown out in May , without being frightened of a dislet let by the Council to prevent their ideas .	-6.7766
The tactical group found a gap in the defence installations and put their vehicles through a section that remained unaffected to find a way .	-5.1287
Wün-residents have pressed the advice of Solbrll , who said that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-6.6005
An anonymous resident said : " You are attracted by the Monday evenings after being sent by Bentley Heath , where they cast stones on the people .	-7.0836
The Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it because it was useless to deal with the problem .	-4.3525
The travellers were there in May , were moved further and are now back .	-2.9457
More came yesterday evening , probably more so today . '	-2.5689
She added : " The advice of Birmingham knows how to handle it by holding long underground transfers to protect their parks .	-4.0091
I live on the streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-3.7321
One of the residents who did not want to be called said : ' It is ridiculous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-5.2861
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . '	-3.7912
A spokesperson of the Council of SolBMll said : ' We are aware of unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working with the police of SolBMlls , taking the necessary legal steps to continue as soon .	-8.7359
In order to support our evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-3.7251
This will help to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-4.5134

The house at the gates of joy is now being renovated and will be opened on the 1st of March next year .	-5.2791
These are good news for the city .	-1.2830
After all , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Bettergesellschaft mbH on 13th April 2014 , about 30 000 overnight stays were lost per year and income was also lost by the health tax .	-7.0927
In the fall of 2014 , faced with dramatically rising numbers of refugees entering the district that offered the hotel to the Land Council as a collective accommodation , resulting in controversial discussions .	-6.5300
The city blocked the inclusion of asylum seekers by setting up a roadplan to ensure the area as a hotel location .	-5.4046
The decision at that time was not undisputed by the Municipal Council .	-4.5847
But especially the joy of Oberbürgermeister Julian Oswald defended the hotel standards there and spoke to the house of serious concern at that time .	-6.4538
He should be right .	-2.1135
The Luenhotel group with manager Birgit Scherer , located in Bad Bergazzers , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and intends to make it a house of the three-star Plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-7.3777
The group has four houses with its cheerful object .	-2.5384
Two of them in Bad Bergzards and one in Bad Herralb .	-3.1560
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-3.7040
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time now and , if you enter the house , it will be clear how extensive renovation will be carried out .	-6.6605
The floors were made apart , the ceilings were partially cut , the old bathes from the rooms .	-6.3152
The hotel as a whole is a single building site .	-2.0778
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.7396
" It 's really a nice hotel " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.1575
Everything is to be renewed in black forest style .	-3.5662
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance is transformed and new windows are built .	-4.8226
Everything later should be " very close to the citizen " as Thomas Scherer says .	-4.3417
" We want to make a jewellery show . "	-2.6389
Swimming pool , spa and meeting room are also included .	-2.5194
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of the hotel in Lauterbad , but already at a high inner city level , Scherer stresses .	-5.8712
With its approximately 60 rooms , the Waldhotel Lumen wants to set up broad , explained Scherer .	-7.6119
Both individual holidaymakers , groups and business people should feel at home in the hotel .	-3.9768
He has already had talks with OB Julian Oswald and travel director Michael Krase , Mr. Scherer .	-4.9384
The views of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .	-3.7941
" We are on the same line . "	-1.4288
Following the investment level , Thomas Scherer does not want to set himself exactly .	-4.7084
Nearly a million euros , he estimates .	-2.8898
The exterior facilities are also put on front office , which is already clearly visible .	-8.5962
A large terrace is created in a courtyard which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is public .	-5.1610
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " A good market with joy .	-3.2853
Russia affair : US Special Counsel sets a Grand jury .	-2.5960
In the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump , special counsel Robert Mueller is alleged to have set up a so-called Grand jury after a report .	-3.8549
The body started work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " , calling on individuals familiar with the matter .	-5.1126
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and stepped up his investigation .	-3.6419
The CNN station reported that there are already first preloads of the body related to a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.9704
US intelligence agencies have long been accusing the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-3.1000
Mueller investigated whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-3.8928
The investigation aims to focus on several men who acted as adviser to the Republic ’ s campaign .	-4.1036
According to reports , Mueller also took a closer look at more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.5430
A few weeks ago , the “ Washington Post ” wrote that the Special Counsel Trump made a personal move to the centre , asking whether the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair .	-6.2593
The main task of Grand Jurys is to check this evidence in crime cases and to decide whether to levy a charge .	-11.7366
So Grand Jurys are also referred to charges .	-3.3568
Usually they are turned on when they are larger and more controversial cases .	-2.8175
The procedure always takes place behind closed doors .	-2.4741
The body can also be turned on by the public prosecutor to invite people for interrogation under oath .	-3.7355
According to the CNN station , precharges have already been issued that focus on meeting Donald Trump , Jr. , and a Russian lawyer .	-6.3684
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was in the report .	-7.0370
They should also provide documents .	-0.8970
Besides Trump , Trump ’ s advisers and daughter-in-law Jared Kushner , and his campaign leader Paul Manafort were also on the conversation .	-8.3678
On Thursday evening , legal experts said on US television that the appointment of Mueller is not to be intimidated in his work and that he would act quickly if necessary .	-7.3758
But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand jury will end up being turned on to decide on the charge .	-5.0123
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body of the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern to President Trump .	-3.8682
In the wake of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign for his political opponents .	-3.7301
" The Russian story is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.7128
The issue gives the Democrats a chance to ' feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-4.0506
His special advisor , Ty Cobb , explained in an opinion that he did not know of the setting up of a Grand jury .	-4.7004
But they also usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-3.2005
The White House is in favour of any measures that have accelerated the work of the Special Counsel in a ' fair ' way .	-3.9160
The former FBI reporter James Comey said three times that the president would not be identified .	-3.3819
There is no reason to think that this has changed , as the statement says .	-4.9761
But he was only used after Trump had roiled .	-3.0890
As a result of this massacre , accusations against Trump have been levelled that he wants to obstruct the judiciary .	-5.3911
Comey said in June before a Senate committee that Trump asked him to stop investigations at the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-4.2133
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.1878
After the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special counsel and his staff .	-3.6815
This triggered speculation as to whether Trump wishes to be made more Mueller .	-4.7635
Unlike an independent Congressional Attorney , such as the Watercat affair for the later retired President Richard Nixon , Mucer has a position in which he could be fired by the Ministry of Justice in theory at the urging of the President .	-6.9623
Several senators from both parties want to avoid such a move .	-3.3039
On Thursday , two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented legislation that the Special Counsel could no longer be dismissed as simple as possible .	-5.3424
Antarctic : Spectacular Ice Mountain operates in the Antarctic .	-4.7157
A gigantic iceberg has been resolved by the nearly seven-fold size of Berlin from the Schell.	-5.3665
The Bremerhavenr Alsfred Wegener Institute for Arctic and Maritime Research conducted on Wednesday .	-5.9290
The more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers of rock will now go north and will probably need two or three years before it has melted .	-6.5083
It is 175 kilometres long and a width of up to 50 kilometres , one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-4.2804
He is not at risk to people .	-2.1394
The extent to which climate change has played a role in stopping the iceberg is unclear according to research specifications .	-4.3142
However , for some 30 years , there has been a series of unusual disruptions of ice in the region , writes the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSDC ) in a factual background .	-5.5314
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-3.0304
The now defunct behemoth has been part of the Larstock Schelder .	-5.0077
Scheldfeis swimming on the sea and fed by large glaciers .	-4.6929
It grows further into the sea and breaks regularly .	-3.4859
The Lareh-C Scheldeits is located south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula .	-4.7737
To the north of this Schelderred was to break the balance of guards and Cancel a few years ago .	-5.8729
A complete Schelder is buried there , writes AWI-researcher Daniela Janssen .	-4.1526
There is a great deal of support for the Larsen C Schelfei , too , because the front edge has never been so far removed as it is at present .	-8.3013
Moreover , the ice plate is under tension and can be eroded if there is a key .	-6.1706
Melting Schelder and Eisberg does not increase sea levels , because they swim on the water and pull ice off as much water as it does after melting .	-7.9316
However , the loss of the Schelfeits leads to the glacier going directly to the sea and flow much faster than before .	-5.7919
This may increase sea levels , but it may only be a minor step , writes the British research project on the monitoring of Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-7.5295
According to AWI data , the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth region of the Antarctic .	-6.6758
From the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean .	-4.6895
It regularly breaks down .	-2.7692
" Although it is a natural thing and is not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now entering a dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Ley of the British Swan University .	-4.8370
" This is the longest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-4.2072
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larschlager C-Scheldfeis now going to grow again or in the long term and possibly fall together , his colleague Mr Adrian Lucman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-7.6708
But this development will take decades .	-1.9586
Even if these scientists do not return to climate change , many ice fractures of the Antarctic Peninsula have been corrosive in recent decades .	-6.4405
This long segment of the Antarctic covers South America .	-1.6531
According to data from the British Antarctic Research Programme , the Antarctic Ice Area has fallen by 28 000 square kilometers since the 1950 ’ s .	-3.0993
The increase in temperature has contributed .	-2.7333
The Antarctic Peninsula has been warming around three degrees in the last 50 years , comprising the areas where the temperature is the fastest running .	-4.9827
CDU wants home arif at the Personal	-6.4824
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU is calling for the association of employers to become more attractive .	-4.5465
Only recently before the summer break , the district celebrates 41 new posts in administration .	-3.9738
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.3706
Now another 17 apprentices are lagging behind their first day of work .	-3.2645
The classes at the circle are obviously highly sought .	-3.5407
Some 620 applications have been made for the seats to be granted this year .	-3.2457
Nevertheless , the circle lacks more staff to be able to handle increased requirements and tasks .	-5.6258
Currently there are still 50 non-occupied jobs at the Mettmann circle .	-3.5672
doctors and engineers , as well as the general administration forces , have been established .	-7.6954
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the German Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) and the German Free Democratic Party ( FDP ) in charge of this day , and to counter the lack of skilled labour in administration .	-7.9272
According to the parties ' desire , the administration is to devise a concept for the recruitment and staffing development ' .	-7.3185
The aim is not only to cover short-term workers , but to counter the need for prospective candidates to face up to the future .	-5.5972
The overall concept should be outward-looking , show concrete measures for crossovers and include a training offensive , ask the CDU , German Free Democratic , and UWG .	-6.7539
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.2885
Because the circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known before .	-4.6460
Other cities provide good officials and employees with more attractive conditions .	-2.9774
The talk is about a genuine ' competition for public employers ' .	-3.1368
This includes a large number of employees who leave sick or age due to their service .	-5.6470
So it is high time to act so that no more jobs are left vacant .	-4.5477
But Klaus-Dieter Volker , the leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint application with his party .	-4.1313
He recently held a bad surprise when he publicly challenged the staffing costs and stunned the other parties .	-4.8765
People want all the opportunities to be checked to allow entry from the municipal employers association .	-6.5063
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution in the short term , then the management of the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with circular cities - should aspire to a corarif , as nations .	-7.1721
In this way , the CDU is trying to better pay the staff and officials than the public service tariff system actually provides for .	-6.8216
The salaries are currently prescribed accurately , increases or more money are only when one changes to a higher level that is oriented toward professionals .	-7.5071
But the challenges of the circle have grown increasingly in recent years .	-2.6880
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces needed to be set up which employees deal with the provisions of the new prostitution law .	-4.7888
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , LandCouncil Thomas Hendele and Head of Staff Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .	-4.5143
Italy toughens the tone for NGO migrant rescue boats	-3.8788
Italy has warned NGOs engaged in bailouts for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-4.0774
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Minister of the Interior , Marco Minniti , in an interview with the Italian daily newspaper La Stampa .	-4.2725
Minnitis ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat of the German aid organisation ' Youth invented ' because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in ways that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.5928
The aid organisation which has been in operation for only a year has refused to express its opinion on extensive charges of the Italian Public Prosecutor Amrogio Cartosio .	-6.6079
" For us , saving human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organisation in an opinion on social media .	-4.5964
" We can only judge all the allegations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation . "	-4.4867
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of ' Youth Save ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.6348
It is suspected that his crew is taking board hose boat migrants who are supplied directly by traffickers and that the smugglers can take off to allow them to be used again .	-7.6172
At least one such encounter was apparently only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosecutor 's Act , the content of which was published by Italian media .	-4.4924
The occupation is suspected to override the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons , not for any other motive .	-3.4238
Under the code of conduct boats such as Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .	-3.1663
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Open Arms from Spain .	-2.6222
The next Thursday said that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not introduce ' substantial changes or obstacles ' of their bailouts .	-4.5049
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organization doctors without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.8744
Mindniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has dropped sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coast and to cooperate with local citizens have borne fruit .	-5.4760
" In recent days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-2.5339
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan citizens this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-3.3613

Fact is : E-Sport has long become a serious industry and has become a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high scores .	-5.0628
That was also recognised by the first federal law , which is becoming increasingly involved in this area .	-5.6650

In the E-Sport , computer games such as " League Of Legend " , " Doom 2 " , " counter counter " or just FIFA football simulation at competitive level will be fought .	-6.6484
A long time ago , as in normal sports , leagues established in which the professionals compete against each other .	-5.2047
And in the 2022 Asian games , e-sport is already part of the official programme .	-2.8340
But is it a real sport ?	-3.0062
Many certainly need to know the idea .	-4.1198
Ingo Froge33 also dealt with the question for a long time .	-5.1665
For the university professor at the German School of Sports in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport , because it is highly competitive and has many biological and physical responses that can be found in classic sports - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.9301
In addition , it needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability .	-3.5545
Professional gamers should not only train their bodies , but also train their bodies and take care of their diet .	-4.3157
" The fitting player is a good player . "	-2.5357
However , it also has problems : ' doping is becoming more and more a subject ' .	-5.9289
Control is difficult to perform in online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classic sports .	-4.6641
The scientists are positive about the high integrative effect of E-Sports .	-4.8082
Players are on the international scene , as is a large global family , and there are no intercultural barriers .	-5.5042
A study of company consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) says E-Sport is preceded by rapid growth .	-5.6075
In 2016 , Germany had EUR 50 million , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and grand tournaments .	-5.0128
In three years , sales are expected to exceed 130 million .	-2.8487
That is little about the EUR 2.4 billion in the football Bundesliga .	-5.0889
However , E-Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " write the deloCounsel .	-5.5500

There is also work in Europe .	-2.6220
In a school in Norway , e-sport was introduced as a teaching device , says Froevil .	-5.4505
In the Netherlands and France , the first football clubs , according to Dutt , are now required to set up an e-sports department .	-3.6075
" In the European comparison , Germany is lagging behind , " says VfB Board of Management Röttgermann .	-5.0092

Michelle Carter is convicted of the texts requiring the Conrad to commit suicide .	-4.6394
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide through texts and calls .	-3.0831
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of condemnation behind bars , and five years have been subjected to probation . . , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , ,	-4.9555
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-6.6244
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is wild .	-2.8776
My son was my best friend . "	-1.1313
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-2.5675
She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representative argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental illness .	-4.0862
Carter was dressed in red trousers and a creme-colour blond , with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and eyes down when she was sentenced .	-6.5502
" Her actions killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutors told the court .	-2.7542
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.0910
She has not taken responsibility ' , she said .	-1.9569
" She has not turned a repentance " .	-3.6878
But Carper 's lawyer said that it is a ' terrible fact that she is completely sorry ' .	-5.4392
But Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find out that their " age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant impact on their actions " .	-4.8175
A prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy who said that there is ' no day in which I did not notice the loss of my beloved son .	-4.4369
I want him to be proud of me and as I go with everything , and I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pain that we will carry with us for eternity .	-12.9973
Roys sister , Camden Roy , said that she will be persecuted by the realization that she will never participate in the marriage of her brother or be a aunt for his children .	-5.6128
" No longer have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain I will keep with me for the rest of my life " , said she .	-4.5280
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to call upon another to commit suicide .	-3.7709
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead from a carbon dioxide in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.8513
The case attracted national attention after Carper ’ s minutes revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-4.8721
" Seeing you , sprg of a building , first you yourself , I do not know there are many ways " , she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was with his family on holiday .	-5.9612
In the eye before his suicide she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " Everything you have to do is disable the generator and you will be free and happy " .	-4.0274
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case through any press .	-3.6972
The case has shared legal opinion .	-2.3447
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder by her British male in Italy before being released two years ago .	-4.7866

Some were there other on his seat in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimme immediately , even if the additional dress was very small .	-6.2045
But as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no surprise was a Dr , and neither a Manuel new was able to see , he made the binding stop to the arm .	-9.2859
" The trainer did not announce it , " explains the sunset winner after his first assignment as the Bavarian captain .	-5.5503

European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-2.8659
But nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered to be carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-3.2038
The costs for car manufacturers , equipment for neutralisation of the exhaust emissions that diesel vehicles have to face are also rising , making it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-7.4027
The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of complicity by the powerful car companies and of ignoring any sign of the problem .	-4.4470

Over and over again , the artist inspired cities .	-3.7899

The lavender is falling in the face of the conditions of drought and of the illness , which gives a great headache to scientists and farmers who try to find solutions .	-5.9557
Eric Chaisse , an expert of agricultural research institutes CRIEEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is in real danger because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which has caused much less rain in spring and in autumn much more .	-6.1484
This affects the lifetime of Lavender .	-2.7528
There is also a small Zikade , a microbacterial , which infeed the dwarf , and in very dry weather there are many of them . "	-6.3156
And there is much at stake .	-1.6685
Not only do you have a bigger oil , but you also need perfume and cosmetics .	-6.8908
Eric Chaisse said : ' Instead of having very long plant lips with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under-developed and either missing or weakened .	-3.0636
So we have less essential oil . "	-3.0804
Among the solutions that are considered , there is better water distribution and a slowdown in the thickening of the ground , but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drought .	-6.7053

The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-1.8405
The staff of the weekly newspaper Ridoce usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting of the recent state chaos through organized crime , corrupt officials and ceaseless drug wars .	-5.7752
But this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.7102
They were told that it is important to change their routine .	-3.4263
Two senior journalists discuss what feels safer : they are supposed to take their children at the office in 2009 , which were the target of an attack with grenades , or leave them at home .	-5.1210
Security experts have written three words on a board on the front of the room : opponents , neutrale , allies .	-3.2741
You ask the reporter to suggest names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and abdominal sentiment rich .	-3.8561
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businesspeople , journalists who are suspected of being on the government ’ s or cartels ’ paylist , a list of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-4.3374
There is no respite from violence and , while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , there are increasing numbers of journalists here : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto take office in December 2012 , 589 are under attack and threats under federal law and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-6.7062
Among the latter , its editor and its inspiration of Ridoce , the co-founder Javier Valenas Cardenas , is located .	-5.6119
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence related to drugs .	-3.2668
His absence is deeply felt , though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valez , which shows his mid-finger with the word " Justice " , depends on the facade of the Rigraph building .	-7.7046
The workshop will take place less than two months after its death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their Alpine dreams , insomnia , Paranoia .	-3.8319
Although a special Bar was built in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , it only began two criminal proceedings .	-4.8137
As with most thousands of murders every year associated with drug trafficking and organised crime , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.7020
At Rioja they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are not yet athletic and although the terrain is now more significant .	-8.1356
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting on security issues has little benefit , says Iarra .	-4.0560
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.3323
" As long as we do not know why , we are all distrustful . "	-3.8900
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the magazine Ridoce in the capital city of Culican .	-3.9942
He was forced from his car and shot at him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper , which is translated with the " Zwölfer " river .	-9.7592
The shooter in his car away and damaged near .	-4.0524
Valkez was 50 years old .	-2.0919
He left one woman and two adult children .	-0.9380
Rumors tend to move freely in Culican .	-3.3205
But there is nothing but silence about the subject of Valez .	-3.4270
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinloa has become one of the country ’ s most bloodiest battlefields , as rival groups struggle to fill the vacuum .	-5.0216
There is no evidence that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot in the street or that the graveyard is full of injected , double-story mouse for drug Queen , larger than many homes for the living .	-7.2647
For one minute , forget that there is a state of " peace " if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-4.6879
Despite this , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Rio Doce , is accused of not protecting his friend .	-5.0067
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.3862
First in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in the war with Guzman 's sons .	-6.3667
This publication may have angered the sons , suspected gear members bought each copy of the edition as soon as they were delivered to newspaper bags .	-4.9085
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to impose his own security after another newspaper published the same story .	-4.2918
Valkez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.6760
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues believed he would always be there .	-2.2041
He served as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined with five colleagues to establish Ridoce and sold $ 50 .	-6.2076
In Sinloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without confronting the narcotics problem " , said Bojorquez .	-4.4202
The newspaper ’ s time earned a reputation for the courageous , honest reporting , and sales and advertising .	-5.0822
reporters loved to be able to publish tough research without fear of censorship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle .	-3.5032
Eight years after the founding of Ridoce , she received the prestigious ' Maria-Moors-Cabot Award ' for her reporting in Latin America .	-3.9694
In the same year , Valdez won the ' International Press Freedom Award ' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for their courage in following the Mexican drug history wherever they were .	-4.3400
He gave up voluntarily to fear .	-2.5890
" I want to continue to live " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-3.2685
Sinalua drug trafficking is a way of life , " said last October in an interview with showerhood TV .	-6.3609
" You must take over the task that you have as a journalist - either that or you play the fool .	-5.0425
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.0743
The Ridoce team miss Valdez , the fun guy who could heat like a port worker , the friend who was generous with transarms and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-6.5753
She was entrusted to his routine .	-2.1383
He would always take his hat .	-3.0067
He would always go to El Guayaquil , the bar to the office , and always sit at the same table .	-3.8147
Now ask them : Was his love of routine his corruption ?	-2.4806
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and keep alive .	-3.5143
" They don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their way-of-city buildings " to move drugs .	-6.8777
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-2.0006
The result , even in the best times , is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.2139
trust one 's own instincts .	-2.6580
If it is wrong , turn away .	-3.1325
The anger is , the publisher of the Rioja Andres Villarroal said that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter has happened to Javier . "	-5.8891
The old rules , as he and others say , are no longer in Sinalua - just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .	-4.6649
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.6144
In the space where Ridoce ’ s employees met for security training , no mobile phones were allowed , and days before , it became known that spyware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-6.9371
Exemptions sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .	-3.2805
They were commissioned by the State Government to protect the offices of Ridoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiican .	-5.4212
Half a joke , some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 % of the police who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-4.4325
It has been months since the reporters went to the alpine scenery where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-4.7678
For this week ’ s edition , Ridoce has seen three main stories .	-4.9406
There was the murder of the brother of the former former boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinloa .	-4.6958
They also had an exposure to government spending focused on the Governor 's home town .	-4.7543
And there was a group that , in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , removed one block from the office of the Public Prosecutor , carried out a kidnapping .	-5.0634
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so it was imperative to write carefully when it was time to know what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local .	-5.3443
A reporter from public records found that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who is a member of the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled almost all political levels throughout the century .	-5.2299
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high corruption cases .	-2.8855
Villarroal asked the reporter to write on previous events in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-4.5211
Only a few months before , readers would have considered the Valez column the best informed source of kidnapping .	-4.0499
" In the past we would have known what has happened " , said Villarroal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of his personality .	-8.8599
" Now all channels of communication have broken down with our sources " .	-2.7275
The Valez office has been transformed into a space of storage for signs and labels that protest against the killings of journalists , because the employees have become something they had never expected themselves : activists on behalf of the press .	-6.2433
reporter Miriam Ramirez wrote a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist at the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-4.8329
Salvador Adme disappeared three days after Valez was killed , in the western state of Michoacán .	-3.5777
A burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests , that it is .	-2.9220
Journalists have become more vocal throughout the country by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on foot and buildings .	-4.4165
On this day , the director Bojorquez is in Washington , trying to gain international support for justice in the case of Valez .	-4.7928
In a meeting with the governor of Sinalua on the day after the assassination of Valez , Ramirez accused the authorities of intimidating journalists and killing them because they said the truth .	-3.6893
She has since asked for her to be recategorised by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has undermined her objectivity .	-5.0163
It repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were surrounded by organised crime , government officials involved and an equivalent society .	-3.8511
In his last book , " Narco-journal " he wrote that reporters will be killed not only by drug gangs , but also by command of politicians and security forces that were subject to organised crime .	-5.5049
The Media Guardian Group " Articulo 19 " dealt more than half of the attacks on police and officials last year .	-6.8567
" In Mexico you go because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-3.1068
Obviously , the killings have a deterrent effect .	-1.6916
Nobody forgets the death of the singer Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-3.0481
Your body was found together with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas-cartels : " Here I am because of my reports " .	-5.0363
A computer keypad and headphones rest next to their separated head .	-3.7987
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.3465
Others continue , as El Manna of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-3.2045
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the front page entitled " What do you want from us ? "	-4.9808
Some journalists have fled from their home states or even from the country .	-1.6142
It is a painful decision .	-0.5457
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.7330
And sometimes they are being driven , as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was assassinated in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the escape from Veracruz .	-6.1301
For those who are lagging behind and continuing work , it is a daily dance with risky choices .	-3.5451
Iarata , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking is terrifying for him .	-6.4711
" Mexico is the hell , and that is why I was reporter " he said .	-3.2854
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Ridoce on the civic platform in front of the office and enjoying beer , when all of their phones started to reach .	-7.9006
A number of gunies with gang rival and security forces near Mazatlan 's seaside resort had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-4.6654
The war has further escalated , as has been promised by a number of cartels in the region .	-2.6647
They have published the latest news on the Web site of Ridoce on mobile phones from the Bor. , , and .	-8.2482
The front page had to be changed next day .	-1.8240
Sirenen howlden near - another shooting in the area .	-4.2340
Bocjorad raised a view of the police who kept watch to see if they were willing .	-5.2614
If they had any fears , they did not .	-3.0274
Under the vast portrait of the fall founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for Sinalua , Ridoce 's staff followed his tracks .	-7.7908
" Just as you can think of it , " said Boejor , " if on the same day that Javier was murdered , the internals asked me to send her to the streets for reporting . "	-6.6639
was not able to compete with other actors .	-8.4215
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.4431
Now researchers found that the first insights of the incredible Nassts of Canadian mountain workers were so well received that experts described it as the " Mona Lisa of the dinosaurs " .	-5.1757
It was so good that they even noticed that his tired skin was brown - and they said they had had something of a " undisclosed past " .	-6.2807
The report in the magazine " Curent Biology " called him " the best-preserved dinosaur that has ever been found , and one of the best dinosaur races in the world " .	-5.7462
The fossil is a newly discovered type of Nodosaur , which lived in the middle of the crest between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.8330
His incredibly good state of affairs has stunned researchers who describe it as ' really remarkable ' .	-4.4846
According to National Geographical reports , the best preserved fossil is its kind .	-4.0947
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-3.0895
He met something that seemed misplaced from the surrounding rock and decided to see more precisely .	-3.3915
The discovery of fossil was sent to the Royal Tyrère Museum of Paleontology .	-3.5633
They spent the next six years investigating the wild beast within <unk> 2,500 ( 1,100 kg ) of severe global interest rates .	-4.3527
After all this hard work , the final result is ready to be unveiled .	-2.2255
" If you just flash a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept " , the main answer or Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrell Museum , said where the creature is visible .	-6.4699
" In the history of science it is considered one of the most beautiful and best known dinosaur races in the world - the Mona Lisa of the dinosaur world . "	-6.3050
Researchers found that this plant fret , although covered with a armor and similar to a shifting tank , was probably threatened by meat pick-ups .	-6.4745
The highly frequented dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-burial that is also used by many modern animals .	-4.9134
This would have allowed itself to be better mix into its surroundings and to escape its enemies , experts say , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaur growers .	-8.4277
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines in May and is now on display in the Royal Tyrère Museum of Palaology .	-5.7204
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of the team who spent more than 7,000 hours trying to thoroughly uncover it .	-6.3061
Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , samples and armour were able to document the astonishing conservation of the example .	-4.3965
They discovered the Kongterchatting , a common defense method in animal rich , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base .	-4.8512
Although the syndication is common , the results are surprising , because the size of Borealopelta is far beyond that of today 's living animals .	-5.8863
It suggests that the dinosaurs were driven by enough pressure from carnivorous dinosaur that evolution favored the obscurity of confrontation as a means of survival .	-5.0429
But most of the contemporary animals using condoms - think of deer , Zebras or Gürttels - are much smaller and more vulnerable than booty , which signals that this Nodosaur was facing a real battle for survival .	-6.4893
" Starkes of predatory behavior on a massive , highly-parked dinosaur show how dangerous the Dinosaurs of Cretaceans had to be crazed " , said Brown .	-7.9001
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scale also shows that the skins of the dinosaur were redbrown .	-3.9227
Scientists continue to examine the animal on evidence of his life , including his or her conservationist content , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .	-5.3947
They believe that the dinosaurs , when he died , went into a river and driven to the sea where he dropped to the seabed .	-4.9858
At this time , Alberta was as warm as South flower today , and rivers and oceans were probably much more widespread than they are today .	-4.4690
" This Nodosaur is really remarkable because it is completely covered with a skin that is protected from a skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal " , said Brown .	-6.8315
" The result is that the animal looks almost as much as it is in the early cre.	-4.5890
You don 't need to spend a lot of imagination to reconstruct it .	-5.4231
It was a time when a huge cranium , carnivorous dinosaur , mounted on two legs , interwoven the earth .	-8.7126
Although the king of them who lived for years with Tyrosirus Rex , had been driven by some of his fearsome forebears .	-6.8694
One of these features is the Acropyogenic , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes heavy monsters .	-6.1834
The scientists whose most recent insights appear in Curent Biology ’ s journal believe that Borealopelta was buried after death in the sea and mumfied in the mud .	-5.3393
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.6236
According to the museum , it is the best balanced dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the clutches to the hips .	-5.7896
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1.300 kg ) .	-3.9331
There were two 20-inch long headed leaders who hit their shoulders .	-5.3687
The researchers believe that the flowering of herbivores was shredded by the Western Canada until a flooding river flooded into the open sea .	-6.5413
But Dinosaurs ' underwater burial provided their armor in an exquisite detail .	-5.1926
The fossilised remains of this particular example are so good that the remains of the skin still cover holdout panels along the Dinosaurs .	-5.5038
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographical , such a level of conservation is as rare as a gain in the lottery .	-3.4234
The more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.1871
Loaded remains of the skin still cover the holdout armours-arms that carry the animal 's skull .	-6.1535
His front base lies on his side , his five fingers are stretched upwards .	-2.9168
I can count the rubble at its sole .	-3.5762
In a thunderstorm : mass karambolage on the A8 : many injured .	-4.8640
Pink accident on Thursday evening at the A8 : Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carradolar .	-5.6740
There are many people who are injured , some kilometres of traffic congestion and a gap .	-5.3361
At the late Thursday afternoon at a mass karambolage , about 20 people were injured on the motorway in Munich ( A8 ) .	-5.1807
According to the police 's first indications , there were only 30 vehicles , including lorries , operating each other , between closing points of the station .	-10.7937
The precise number of casualties first did not provide any information .	-5.8950
It was easy to medium sized injuries , a police speaker said .	-3.5750
A wide range of rescue vehicles was at the point of departure .	-5.3195
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich .	-2.7233
In Munich , the capital of Munich was about ten kilometres of long RAL .	-7.3779
As a AZ-reporter reports , there were massive obstacles on the counter-tracks - many Gaeffer .	-8.1511
The fire brigade listed the characteristics of the car controller who are now faced with sensitive penalties .	-4.3418
Shortly after 18 : 45 , another accident occurred at the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dagling .	-4.0287
This led to a collision between a car vehicle vehicle vehicle and a passenger .	-4.9070
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident .	-3.6393
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-In " .	-1.4608
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nothing is caught up in the train and sleeping .	-5.0412
Or we are deeper into his work and have just one ingenious idea .	-5.2462
And then : puff .	-1.2026
Made by the conductors and creates a smooth and well-rounded passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-6.4748
Ticket control .	-2.1228
But the periods of disruptions are over .	-3.1912
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the failed ticket control .	-4.5077
You just confirm by phone that you take your seat and then change your ticket .	-5.2321
Currently , a test operation runs on two routes .	-3.6920
" If the offer is available , we will reach it .	-5.8454
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other road routes in Germany " , said a rail test .	-5.7031
" Comfort check-in " calls the train the ticket analysis without conductors .	-5.2929
To be able to use them , however , a few conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or a Tablet .	-4.1431
And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers do anyway .	-4.0462
You also have to buy it via the rail 's App and the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book your ticket .	-6.0871
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-2.1995
Because the " comfort check-in " works so : you get up the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-5.5191
A button for electronic devaluation is then displayed for the test customers .	-3.9085
The train crews will receive a message on their mobile devices that the passenger X is in the train and has taken the seat of the booked Y .	-6.6068
If the train companion is placed in the driver 's seat at the ticket control , he knows that there is a passenger seat with already paid online ticket .	-7.1510
So you can continue to sleep , continue working , remain silent .	-4.5554
Check-in has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which in turn should be used to passengers .	-4.8769
" If you want to travel comfortably without your ticket control by our train crew , check in the DB Navigator .	-4.9778
This allows the passengers to make their travel time in the train personal " , says Michael Peteron , the marketing board of DB long-distance traffic .	-5.3093
The second plus is that our employees have more time than they are today to respond to individual customer needs .	-4.5440
Those who often carry the train know that , alongside delays and passing trains , the ticket checks are among the main contradictions .	-7.4201
Often , however , one of the travelling passengers does not have all the documentation you need to retrieve online tickets .	-5.7304
Either a credit card or an identity card or a document is missing .	-3.8922
The result is endless discussions between train crews and passengers , resulting in poor mood in the withdrawal or greater delay in controlling their own tickets , and the conductors at the end take time to take care of other concerns .	-7.9879
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-1.6412
And this is only on the ICE 915 Dortmund teuer and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-6.3461
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked .	-3.1215
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Whose Streets ? "	-2.8438
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.7381
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the security in St. Louis was on the bed of an Airbb apartment that she rented and scrolled by Facebook on her phone .	-4.7997
They lock through a post from someone from the High School .	-3.8910
" The police just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the streets , " it said .	-3.9374
Dissolve , because nobody else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and Twitter .	-4.0156
A user with the handle @ Theepharaoah was constantly credited to their time-line .	-4.4021
Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was killed live by Michael Brown , an unarmed black age of 18 killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-4.3370
He posted an image of browns shank body that was isolated on the street and would stay four hours there .	-6.4080
" That is wild , " Ferrell was with her .	-5.2737
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.7197
She discontinued her mobile phone to return to Tweets about people on the Canfieldd Drive later this evening .	-5.2374
There were photos of the police band and people writing , and of a man who claimed to be browns father who bore a shield with labeling : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-5.3696
She observed a live feed that was police in front of a group of demonstrators with a nice dog .	-3.9090
In another video , she said , gave away another piece of police his guns and screaming : " I will kill you ... animals all . " . the of , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.8417
" This is not common , " says Ferrell what she said .	-4.5406
" This is not the kind of murder to which we have used to us and which we can typically call . "	-4.6982
In this moment I felt I was shaking .	-3.3460
I was furious and angry . '	-1.6999
You book a return flight and went home on the next day .	-3.3148
After landing at 23 o 'clock , she abandoned her six-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-5.5048
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson over the next three years is the theme of a new documentary , " whose Streets ? " , in which cinemas from 11 .	-4.4960
It is a story of survival and of protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exist from the point of view of the people living in the Community who filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.6976
As a Ferrell with her daughter who bore a flower dress and a fitting crown , according to Ferguson , the two languages discussed a conversation that they had several times before this morning » about the black experience and black state « .	-5.3367
" You remember you how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " She remembered what she said .	-4.0514
" We are now going to Ferguson , because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.5460
I could not take them " , said Ferrell later .	-1.9711
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past ...	-2.1902
You must know it and see it and be raised .	-3.8771
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the various sections of the black experience and the black Constitution , and what we must do to be free to get rid of ourselves .	-5.0662
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience glaring racism , she is no different from the next black woman 's eye .	-6.0096
I feel I would do her a poor service to keep her away from it . '	-5.3166
The first station , when they arrived in Ferguson , was located at the South Florianssane Road , a place faced by the police authority , which became a camp when activists waited for the possible non-charge of Judge Darren Wilson .	-7.4804
There , Ferrell and her daughter linked to a local business owner , who made lunch .	-4.2883
They prepared pockets and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.7263
Slowly , a new type of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-3.1227
" My activism has changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Connecticut .	-5.7657
" I had no experience in organising .	-0.9855
Everything has happened . '	-2.5686
Weeks later , Ferran met during a evening demonstration of Sabah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-3.4120
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvaro-Farrar wanted only " document " what happened .	-4.5292
One question came to Carlsbad : " Would you document or try to find a story that you can exploit ? "	-4.4108
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people , often White in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.3219
As Folayan recently stated in an interview , " We had heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not centralise their votes and we wanted to change it . "	-6.2895
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism for death toll holders .	-4.6018
His commitment brought Ferrari closer to the project , together with six other local residents , followed the team of " whose Streets ? " in the years after browsing .	-5.1188
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us .	-2.0508
" That was the main thing for me how these people are represented , for this is how I am going to be represented . "	-4.9791
The aim was not to focus on Ferrari 's experience - to show that the movement ' is not a Messios leader , but a community that comes together ' , said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.7371
As a result , documents of " whose Street ? " surprise personal aspects of Ferrari life , as they fall in love and marry their wife .	-4.3463
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.4148
" But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the exaltation of black people . "	-3.6830
In addition , Gates ’ story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Livs-Matters movement .	-3.5644
Two of the three founders of the movement , who , following the killing of the black teenagers Tracyby Martin in 2012 , identified the " BlacklivesMatter " movie in social media as gay .	-5.0068
" Black , gay women in managerial positions have taken the movement as a whole " , said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-4.6796
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . '	-2.1781
Folayan voted to notice that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.9939
However , it insists that " this is not an affive type of action " selected by Ferrell because of its identity as the heart of the film .	-5.5375
" She was the person who sacked this energy , " she said .	-2.3530
" It is not a coincidence , even though she was at the front , because in a life on these crosses , she is regarded as a black , gay woman .	-7.3076
You can feel your energy through the screen . "	-2.4454
Now the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-3.6639
Ferrell is looking for 2 <unk> years for blocking a motorway during a demonstration .	-3.5244
It describes the region 's social atmosphere , which she calls her home : ' A chaos ' .	-4.2713
Nevertheless , she keeps an eye on a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went on the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-5.9381
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9860
It is our duty to gain .	-1.3735
We must love and support each other .	-1.0005
We have nothing to lose - apart from our chains . '	-2.2288
From " dream " to " size mania " : TV readers discuss bitbit gallery .	-3.3354
The bitbit gallery moves people , even though they are not yet built .	-3.6604
But the idea of a shopping centre at the south end of the pedestrian zone has been dividing the people of supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .	-3.9216
The topic is hardly a cold one .	-3.6356
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreundswburg " .	-4.2676
While some say to the bit gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anaja Becker ) or " This would be real class " ( Nicole Schasten ) , comes from the other side : " Does not mean man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or simply : " Superstimbre ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.4635
While supporters are building that a gallery will attract more customers to the city , benefiting the rest of the business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then disappear .	-6.7142
In addition , the gallery is planned on the site where the farm market is located , in which 13 direct marketing offers its products .	-5.0463
This will stop at the beginning of the construction work .	-3.5182
The gallery designers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda seat with possibility of sitting outside .	-5.0268
Simone Zimmer : " We have been purchasing almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years .	-3.4833
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women .	-3.4886
We also discovered the butchers .	-1.8583
We hope that even during and above all after the construction of the gallery there will be an opportunity to maintain this offer .	-3.7644
In other cities , there is also .	-3.2857
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-2.6313
Gerd Densing : " Whether you are looking for direct marketing in a market hall in the gallery comes to the height of the rent .	-4.5122
But this is probably not very low in the new project . '	-5.0891
Eva Kilic : " Why Shopping Carts in Bitburg ?	-1.8401
Whether clothing , shoes , crotches or supermarkets , I find that superfluous .	-5.3216
There are enough of this in our city .	-2.6833
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.3935
However , as there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that at least we maintain the market hall .	-4.7846
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly distributed directly by the producer , and on top of it is cheaper .	-6.1269
As you can see , shops in a shopping center are only issued by larger firms , because rental prices are often not sustainable for a retailers .	-6.1968
A pity , special business almost no longer exists and what remains of it will probably disappear . "	-6.6888
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit me together .	-2.0394
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.7693
Above all , where is the farm market place to go during the construction time ?	-4.6500
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the bitbitbitches are actually coming .	-4.8220
Or does it create the spectre gallery Bitburg already in advance ? "	-4.8747
George Marquet : " It will simply not work .	-2.1915
And there is no need for a shopping centre that is empty .	-3.6284
I think it would have been better to promote a proper agricultural market instead of this gallery .	-3.2227
But there is no room for a farm market hall , thanks to the incredibly many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-5.0752
Once the farmers ' market hall is removed , a piece of culture will disappear . '	-4.0079
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.4877
In the center of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which almost imperceptible the same - hanging on the ceiling .	-5.0313
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heath Dewey-Hagborg from Wanen-TuFilm and haircuts , sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-5.7973
Manning sent the excnited from the prison Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst kept a 35-year sentence after making publicly known as a secret diplomatic message about the WikiLeaks website .	-8.3038
The new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Beeready Resembedded ( A suitable similarity ) .	-6.2573
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline unites its expertise in technology , computer science and art , Manning , a Transwoman and a pioneer , whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama only three days in his office .	-5.7656
Dewey-Hagborg , through the DNA algorithm extracted from Manning and created from 30 portraits , how someone could look like these genomics , has a sharp intellectual , if not just a comment on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - also created to the identity .	-9.3880
Manning , which was born as Bradley Edward , but since she was openly talking about identification as woman , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the spy , computer fraud and theft .	-6.5613
By the prison her image was suppressed , so much that there was only one photograph - a grain , black and white Selfi , where he was clearly sitting on a driver seat and wearing a platinblond perimeter - associated with it .	-8.5897
Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions .	-2.7423
It produced the artist portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette bites and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look like .	-5.5775
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.1015
" You conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.5627
And she could not visit this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked them whether to make an DNA portrait .	-5.3333
The artist and her imprisoned Muse were joined at an unfair letterhome that sold several letters over two years .	-7.1851
They even created a comic " Supplier Images " illustrated by Shoili Kannggo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsesas ’ s judgment would be converted and able to view the exhibition personally .	-5.9178
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would call for men ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy encounter .	-4.1858
There is also something low and strong now when the exhibition opened , as Donald Trump leads a war against informers from the government camp and against Transgenders troops to find new , viable ways to further inflame the rigid divisions that he should fix .	-7.5019
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-2.4799
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called with its overwhelming signature ( the " i " in her family name is attached with a heart ) to an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which sex , sexuality and culture have been based . "	-5.4208
On the opposite wall , their mitochondrial DNA sequence is written into a pencil of thousands of visitors from Cs and Gs .	-7.0707
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how amazing similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-2.7924
" What people hopefully will take away is that our genome is not concerned about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , track memory , is also visible .	-5.1399
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are " .	-2.3373
The last part of the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above Comic-Novelle .	-4.0868
She shows how she appears with a free-talk phone in the hands of the disciplinary societies of the United States such as King-Kong .	-3.5613
" If you have your speech kaltstellen , then they won , " it says .	-5.0043
" So never stop the mouth " .	-1.8106
" It came directly from a letter she written to me " , said the artist , speaking of Philadelphia .	-4.5086
" I still get track of corridors when I talk about it . "	-4.7528
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as anticipated in the comic book - but if it were to do so , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , from its own genovese simulation , which is mixed up by hordes of protesters .	-8.5792
It was also targeted as everything in the exhibition to the size ( 5 " 2 " , mannings statutes ) , where their genetic registration was written with a pencil .	-7.4923
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of portraits .	-2.7952
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that beats Chelsea , like the movement that was behind their liberation . "	-4.0754
Professor of the University of Northwestern and a employee from the University of Oxford for killing .	-3.4615
A nationwide human hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and a university assistant , Oxford , who are being sought as a suspect after a man had been in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .	-6.9030
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranleau , as the acts of Cook County 's court of office show .	-9.0137
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several graves .	-3.1519
A Community alert system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-3.4097
Officials received a call , joined the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.8413
Cornell Duranlecau was still declared dead , and detectives examined the perpetrators as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two suspects , officials said .	-5.4416
Lateem has been an exceptional professor of microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-3.7923
Alan K. Cubbin , the vice president for university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem should now be represented in court and had been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-5.2012
" This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation , " said Cucbbage .	-5.1256
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.8539
One speaker from the university and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in any way possible ' .	-4.6593
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted to see him stand up .	-3.9175
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Guglilmi , said he strongly urging the suspects to stand up to the authorities .	-4.4074
" The police have an idea of their location and our efforts to localize them " , said Guglilmi .	-3.2907
Guglilmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-2.1987
Guglilmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a shiny tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-5.4214
The police described the scene very cruel .	-0.9023
Guglilmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-3.0440
It was confirmed by safety cameras that Lathem and Warren were on the building .	-2.8483
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship " , said Guglilmi .	-2.4606
The Grand Plaza management team published a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and research a variety of motifs , including a possible home event . "	-5.3923
" We will close the WADA-timetable in the near future " - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko .	-3.7826
The Russian remier Vity Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSA ) .	-3.6510
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road map , RUSA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UK Anti-Doping ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-4.8827
The WADA-timetable has been updated in this regard , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-3.4218
The PM commented on the second part of WADA 's roadmap for complying with the code that describes the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and was published recently on the organization 's website .	-5.0333
According to Mutko , he does not contain anything that could cause concern for Russia .	-3.2962
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-1.9076
And the results will be submitted to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.7887
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren for government-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.9039
As for the matter , Mutko said : " We conduct the investigation because our anti-doping system had made a mistake .	-4.7445
All measures have been implemented .	-1.4471
But there were no government programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-4.0071
Mutos 's words were in line with those of Vitali Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-Doping Commission .	-4.7005
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov had problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules .	-4.8522
No one has suggested that this report be unconditionally accepted , " he added .	-4.8234
RUSADA was ruled out in November 2015 as part of the doping scandal by the WADA from the implementation of doping checks in Russia .	-4.8401
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.5427
After a visit to the main headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July WADA-Director Olivier Nireggi declared that RUSA moves " in the right direction " to be used again .	-5.3124
Alfi did not sell eggs for the time being .	-3.3391
That shared the business groups .	-1.8713
It is a precautionary measure , and no health pollution could continue to be affected by the communication .	-5.6662
From now on only eggs will be delivered to Alfi , who have been proven to have been tested for fiigned anti-inflammatory means .	-6.8067
Alfi wanted to create clarity and transparency for his customers .	-3.8891
Startups , which will help your company , will not become the next translation .	-3.8825
Amy Ertt wanted to measure luck at your e-Commerce-Startup , but the surveys did not work .	-5.4204
Answers were often vague , little helpful , or , worse still , fraudulent .	-2.6566
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not regret the process .	-2.7636
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Ertt , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-3.3952
She created people from outside for help .	-2.9550
A new race of Human Resources Start is up at the watch to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.7479
Through the creation and licensing of software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to raise special groups and demographic groups , to offer anonymity and complaints hotlines , and , in some cases , to allow whistle-blowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and turn directly to the Board .	-7.5491
" You have tools such as Stratva and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees .	-4.2113
Calculate said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint in the three years .	-5.0177
In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a company 's heat card that shows the most complaints and which managers have low approval results - so you can drill down why .	-7.2221
Companies understand that they must remain at the top of job culture so that you will not become the next translator , who has been involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-6.1456
For starters like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.3719
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial-technical website Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.4793
Denver , Colorado , Start up Conversion , which helps businesses avoid and recognize bad behavior , offered discredited everything at the beginning of this year in the U.	-5.8760
Conversion has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-2.2283
Uber has recently registered itself as a client .	-2.0985
Like Glint , Conversion lets companies " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-5.9713
It also offers an anonymous text hotline , which allows staff to report bad behavior .	-4.3878
And if the principal business manager is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.4404
" The Justice of Public opinion covered the regulating , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and director of Conversion .	-5.1387
If a company that treats its employees badly or is unethical , it may experience costly consequences by consumer blacklisted , worker turnover , and complaints , Quinlan said .	-7.3705
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has deployed Conversion for more than one year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way of achieving their company ’ s central goals .	-5.4366
Previously , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company ’ s central office , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.5183
It was often a intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to listen to employee complaints .	-4.5845
Now that the company has been using Conversion , problems that were previously hidden by executives who were in offices in cities or countries can be identified and raised more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice .	-6.7537
" I can come closer to this holistic , 360-degree view into the experience of employment " , said Vitano , which leads the risk management group in Ruby Tuesday .	-4.4785
" And we protect our shareholders from job litigation . "	-3.3412
Companies began to take more seriously the ethics , values and staff engagement in 2002 , after the accounting law Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-5.9498
But it took until the social media came to their right , that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty linen online .	-5.0525
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-2.0162
Both glint and Conversion offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .	-3.8956
It is a business model and an opportunity to obtain the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both startups .	-3.2324
Conversion received $ 10 million in financing from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-3.5870
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November by Bescha Venture Partners and put its total funding to $ 60 million .	-4.4667
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.7358
There is a growing research complex that shows that today ’ s employees expect more than they have done .	-3.6378
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only bets .	-2.6132
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.8668
" When people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you are doing is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Name and Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-5.4347
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , when employees are committed and committed .	-3.9335
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and commitment of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.1310
The data about employee engagement according to the experts in job culture is important .	-5.4671
But data are useless if a company administrator does not take any action .	-3.1020
Indeed , when a company asks for feedback , it can be expected that change is on the way .	-3.6691
And if change does not come fast enough , or at all , this can incite frustration and discourage people .	-5.0782
" When you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have relied too heavily on data collection .	-5.3139
" For if you don 't follow people will ask themselves , " Did you really hear me ?	-3.5525
Are you satisfied ?	-3.1916
And who you do not care about why should I ? '	-6.7534
Madison , who is currently posting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , so Er.	-5.5939
And after the collection of feedback from frustrating employees , it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication effort to address the problems .	-5.5824
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is gaining new insights about its employees , and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry that is well known for high sales .	-6.9208
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people " , said taking place .	-3.0804
" And if you lose people , you also lose clients .	-2.1676
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-2.0625
The NCAA will remove the two day practices and make a long day for the Bruins .	-2.7189
It ’ s up to 23 o 'clock when a lot of LAUC-Football players compete on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-5.3340
Some have picked up their trialake parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the workout .	-5.5638
For a good part of the team these idle minutes will be lunch break .	-3.3326
Players enrolled in the summer classes will return to their final examinations after the three hours of exercise before returning to the Water Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 a.m.	-4.4778
" This is a real pedal mill for the boys the next three days , " said Bruins-trainer Jim Mor just before the Monday was Tuesday .	-4.6681
The NCAA eliminates two day practice to ease the burden of players , and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.5738
Therefore , the first three exercises of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already fully equipped timetables of the player .	-5.1152
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the camp at the beginning of the last season almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mors 6 playing hours in Westwood .	-6.3770
We will organize 18 exercises during the course of August , 20 before the start of formal preparations for their , Texas A & M in September .	-6.8654
Mor said that he would support the variation of the NCAA , even if she added another point to the players ' multiple routes .	-5.3395
" We put this huge burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mor .	-3.2108
" And they just pushed it through , they grob themselves , they are great people .	-4.0541
I think as soon as we come to the Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.9103
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear line of views of its fields , from an adjacent parking area and the adjacent Lutskin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already been promoted with footballs that will be a protection net behind a gate map .	-8.8700
Bruins will fill the hotel during this weekend , but Moray acknowledged that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-5.2490
" We will use our security , " said Morag .	-2.8514
" This is a real problem , and it is not far to think that people are renting a room there and then prepare for an exercise .	-5.9234
If you have a video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good business .	-3.0626
But we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-7.2712
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.8449
I am not therefore very concerned .	-3.2281
We have a plan . '	-0.8336
Facebook intends to intensify Tatsachen-Review in the battle against fake news .	-3.4632
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reviews by third parties and then show their results under the original post , the world 's largest online social network on Thursday said that it is one of his efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-6.6030
In an opinion on its website , the company said that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to Faktenvalier who may display the results of the fake-checking from the original article .	-8.3657
Facebook was criticised as one of the main contributors to so-called factual news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .	-3.6413
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooding false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany is supporting a plan to punish social media networks if they do not manage to quickly eliminate the full hatings as they were before the September elections .	-6.0607
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fake-review will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.4507
" In addition to the realization of what stories of fake advertisers are contested , people want more context to make informed choices about what they read and share , " said Sara , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.9002
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce incorrect news .	-4.7938
Creating a Comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-2.2460
In his younger past , the little ney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in 1970-he and 1980-he years .	-4.7969
But Romney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his comfortable seat at the Admir River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel of Jamie Rhodes , a moped York-raising with a preference for historical documents .	-7.4149
" I find it so beautiful to look at someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says flying .	-4.5987
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands " .	-2.0480
" A Castle in England " crosses the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-4.5397
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpectedly emotional .	-3.5234
" I only responded to the cutoff pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700-he years working for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.9701
" That is his down pressure !	-2.9899
And letters always run into smoke , because there was a fire for the light .	-6.2087
For someone who lives 300 years later , the scent has an effect , as if it were .	-4.2889
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.1507
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle for almost four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued " ) this seems all too nice to be true .	-6.3918
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , exploring the archives , and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the Palace , such as the monger hyboarder heads of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-7.3914
He wander through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape gardeners , and sometimes with artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-5.0691
Then , at night he went to " Whiskey " and started writing " .	-2.9011
The intimate history of ney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last inheritance , Elizabeth Husley , died .	-3.8366
When the Rhodes hit a decade later , the workers started to care about the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which Aristotle said " Oh , fits it on the roof floor " .	-6.5467
diaries , letters from the time of the English empire , cards that represent who owned what : " One might think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a bird to fight the two families .	-5.0458
boys , let 's go all his way ! "	-3.7995
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farming climb of 1381 .	-4.8605
" There is a record of a storm that occurred in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Hardy Family of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-5.4752
" The peasant revolt began in this area , and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-3.0135
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-3.4953
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Prist ' , which tells the story of the Jesuits , who hid the Darkrell family for seven years during the English reform .	-4.5437
Or ' The Smugler ' , in which the smugglers Arthur Darrell from the 18th century performed his own funerals by filling a coffin of stones ( a discovery that was made years later than his coffin was excavated ) .	-5.9070
Darrelays are Rhodes ’ favourite family of ney : " Gentlemen seem to be almost generous Gauner , repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-6.2672
Other generations of Darrell-men solved their debt crises by married rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of well-looking boys , with a talent to recruit creators . "	-4.6095
After the end of his work in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique write experiences .	-3.7646
He left behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elgriki , the site of a spa resort dating back to the early 20th century , which has been called back by nature .	-6.8415
But Romney has a special seat for him .	-2.6880
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-0.8803
It was like ' Oh , now I have to finish with the divine life ' .	-4.8935
Campaign started : Over 300 years old chapel in Rhöndorf buried .	-4.7554
With the Approaching of the 301 years old chapel in Rhöndorf , the town of Bad Honnef started its campaign to launch a new roof mark ( see photo page of Thursday ) .	-7.3400
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team want to keep the logo and slogan secret to Nelson Artz .	-3.3714
At the end of August there will be a feast on the island of Grafenwerh as the peak of the campaign .	-4.2926
" Very nice for us .	-2.6599
Or ? " , the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhönorfer Chapel .	-4.1438
" We don 't think this ( of course ! ) , write it on their website yesterday .	-3.6624
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.8022
And to make it clear that things are better than it seems .	-2.1387
Basically , we firmly believe that we as Bad Honnefer citizens know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-5.1856
The action is more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.7726
" We must formulate a single promise , one that gives the city an unmistakable unique selling feature " .	-4.7597
After all , it is in competition with other local communities .	-2.7348
Bad Honnef is a medium five-digit sum that can cost its new roof brand and campaign .	-5.8328
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdo<unk>an ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.1215
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotion of the Official Corps .	-5.3731
That same week .	-2.1886
At first sight a normal process .	-2.1934
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.5083
The meeting was held no longer in the building of the General Office , as before , but in the Prime Minister 's office .	-5.7224
In the discussions under the Presidency of the Heads of Government , the five Vice-presidents and the ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Home Affairs have now also taken part .	-6.5064
As a result , civilians in the YAS were in excess .	-3.7381
The government is taking the reins in the military .	-2.7019
The Chief of the Army Staff , Hulusi Akar , remains in office , but the commander of the Army , the Air Force and the Marine Corps were dismissed .	-6.3978
Ever since the failed coup , head of state Erdogan has fired the 169 326 generals and admiral .	-3.7467
More than 10,000 troops were removed from the army - mostly because of popular connections to the movement of the exiled preacher Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as the chief messenger of the coup .	-5.7979
A total of 486 people who should have been directly involved in the coup attempt has been negotiating in Ankara since this week .	-4.5879
Even on the day after the coup , Erdogan described the crash attempt as a " gift of God , " as he gives him the opportunity to " fully clean the armed forces " .	-6.1827
But Erdo<unk>an really has the army under control ?	-2.2378
At the end of February , the newspaper " some riyet " published an article entitled " uneasy in the military headquarters " .	-3.5667
In general , there are concerns about an increase in the ' Islamisation ' of the army , which , among other things , manifested itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban for soldiers .	-8.1241
But the army and the security forces are continuing to prosper .	-4.1209
In mid-July , Erdo<unk>an ordered to fire further 7395 state servants , including 2303 police and 546 soldiers .	-5.2079
It seemed that Erdo<unk>an had tamed the military .	-3.0613
The generals were supposed to be the true lords of the country .	-2.7246
Three times , they went on calling for their role as guardians of the secular order .	-5.4446
Following his victory in 2002 , Erdogan pressed the military ’ s power step back , not least on the European Union ’ s reform objectives .	-4.6820
Former officers say that Erdogan is specifically advancing an Islamicisation of the armed forces .	-3.3255
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a so-called officer looking for asylum for the coup attempt out of fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and Salafists " in a few years ' time .	-7.1506
If that were the case , NATO could not let it cold .	-3.9812
In the alliance for the cleansing of these self-employed self-employed self-employed self-employed self-employed firms , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army .	-6.4359
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened " , say Nato diplomats .	-2.5334
Washington changes the rules for the Green Card	-1.2428
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , cited by the media .	-4.4988
It proposes reducing legal immigrants at 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-4.3171
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.6129
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.4305
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries receive green cards . "	-3.4940
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.6957
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates speaking in English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , cited by the American media .	-4.9538
Ministry wants to explore track for endurance and sprint riding .	-5.7290
Over and over the past few months we have been discussing the future of racing - now it is going to go very quickly .	-8.9436
Even before the end of the year , it is planned to build on the marble road on which the tourist railway goes .	-6.2237
In order to ensure the future of driving licence for the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction is to begin this year .	-6.9891
" With the decision to continue to order and renew the route of Ilmenau racing platform , the country commits itself to this important link , especially for tourism , " said Minister of Transport Klaus Flehl on Friday in Erfurt .	-7.5167
The cost of the repair of the route amounts to approximately EUR 2.5 million .	-3.4250
Of this amount , the country will account for 75 % .	-2.8684
The treaty , on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future , is now to be definitively voted , declared unconditionally .	-6.6302
The Ministry and the South Kivu Railway as the operator are already in agreement on the technical details .	-4.3602
" That is how the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Sühl .	-4.6961
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Service will be closed for a duration of 11 years .	-2.6282
In order to be regulated by the race management shuttle on December 2017 .	-4.3224
The race-running shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and the race-platform for tourists .	-7.2925
In recent months , a pilot operation has been tested , whether the route is being used by a sufficient number of people to order it again .	-5.8625
The course is also highly structured in part .	-3.9191
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned .	-2.1315
Just when you thought that 2017 cannot become even more mad , a new report on technological developments in the sex robot sector is coming .	-4.6572
Yes , in fact .	-0.9589
Sex-robot is a big thing at the moment .	-4.1871
Recently the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.8059
According to Noel Sharkey , emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-3.7153
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , the shape of the chest slit and the type of fingerprint .	-3.7917
" People are making fun about them , but businesses are delivering a lot of it , and we will see it much more often , " said Mr Sharkey when he announced his new report .	-8.5534
Modern sex pubs have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-5.5690
The user can also customize his robot according to his convictions , thus selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest slit to the type or color of his finger nails .	-5.7434
But it becomes even more worrying , as many robots have the " personalities " that would make a Stepford woman more progressive .	-4.4048
Modern sex puffing has become a robot with a silicone skin .	-3.0539
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robot to the characteristics they find most appealing , such as Schülly .	-4.9685
And then there is the Roxxx Gold Sex-robot developed by True Companion , developed by True Companion , with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which conveys the impression of nervousness and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous person .	-7.1426
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality " , while ignoring the site of True Companion .	-6.4356
She like what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-3.6864
Over the course of the day she also has her feelings - quite like real people !	-4.9115
She can be tired of being fixed on conversation or she can be " mood " !	-3.4661
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the underdeveloped female properties , the references to rape when one step towards Frigid ( here : reluctant ) Farrah is most alarming .	-6.0375
On his website , True Companion Roxx compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-4.6193
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibration , why can men not have a Roottex ? " says it on the website .	-5.0855
But these sex robots are not only a fetishist or just another sex toy .	-4.7287
Their origin and their increasing sophistication point to something dark and deeper in our culture , in a retreat from the ideal of gender equality , to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-8.8223
Most men will of course not think of sex robots , and while the FRR has noted its growing popularity , they remain on the verge of consumer culture .	-5.8259
But what breaks out from the zones of the periphery can be very instructive in the spirit of the time we live in .	-5.3638
And many people are not strange or abusive until the free market allows them to do so .	-2.8309
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing in a time when the rights of women are at risk worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has complained about sexual attacks .	-6.7981
The most chilling aspect of the TV-series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphic images , the dull body and the dull eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.6713
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .	-3.1487
The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( even with porostar proportions ) .	-4.1605
Their creators want to feel human to copy the movement of a real body .	-3.2711
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-2.4942
They cannot be detached or simply removed from their companions .	-3.9249
You have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of totalitarian subjugators .	-4.0709
In other words , they are ludicrous slaves .	-2.4386

Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.2623
He makes Mitt Romney the epitome of common sense sense .	-3.1689
It has become a Trump era truism that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format .	-3.9634
Around Christmas and Harvest there were newspapers in the US asking for advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s election relatives .	-5.3388
We are all supposed to be cutting back on our filter bubbles .	-3.1709
Less noticed is the power of Trump ’ s family to bring together .	-2.8145
I mention this because my cousin , a left-facing poet living in Chicago and having long been busy with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-4.9739
It reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.9394
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the Republican kin with which she fought for decades of politics , is suddenly and completely strange on the same side .	-4.3421
With regard to the dining table , this is certainly a good thing , but it strikes me in another context that it brings with it considerable risks .	-3.7726
The left was strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s derelict effect has the power to put all of us on the right .	-4.6127
When we talk about ``normalisation ' and Trump , we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day we will no longer be deluding ourselves .	-4.5208
There is , however , an even frightening long-term scenario in which Trump ’ s Republican of the Right is " normalized " , which , once compared to its standards , suddenly seems to be the embodiment of sound .	-7.3684
Today , I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s early version of the Verback – the car roof dog , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement was made ) – both of which seem to be a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-7.8892
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must only be mentally healthy to qualify as an immense improvement .	-3.5494
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Karussell in Central Park , the largest of the New York 's car park staff , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you do not need any caffeine .	-7.2687
The horses are enormous , the fibre fibre designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are sperm and the animals are twisted to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the brilliant music gives this in a strange way .	-5.9189
So many stereotypes in a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , Skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-5.1485
Five and thirty years later , and I am still not quite across the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss Cottage - the thematic pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not counted - but a big round-about in North London .	-5.6505
But the Central Park is still a strange magical experience , because two years , one 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year years can go to it and all have a great time .	-7.2736
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given it the full amount , but , fortunately , no one asked for it .	-4.2416
On the other hand , I was forced this week in a department store to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before getting through my credit card .	-3.9029
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option to have a 15 % tip allowance - this to buy something about the retail table .	-6.9770
Not only does this lead to a slowdown in what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also put pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where it is not necessary .	-5.2678
The poor woman in the department store was terribly perturbed while I was tired of the experience of getting her my credit card with five stars .	-6.9197
She is a doctor who has been assigned to hospital with a breast pain .	-8.8385
Pistorius left the prison for a visit to hospital for the second time .	-2.0896
Last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hand joints , who , according to the prison authorities , suffered a case in his cell .	-6.2805
Pistorius was condemned for murder , following an appeal by prosecutors against a first homicide judgement .	-5.0611
In the early morning of the Valentine 's Day in 2013 , he played her through a private balcony in Pretoria .	-7.8061
Pistorius claimed that he held his friend for a night intruder that was hidden in the cabin .	-4.3610
prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six years sentence of Pistorius , who they say is too lenient .	-3.8405
The national law enforcement authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.4775
Pistorius is running the risk that his penalty will be increased to 15 years when public prosecutors are successful .	-4.8063
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7740

Three junior junior students will go up to school in the future , four at real school .	-7.2034
In this evening , the school director Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Biinininhouse in Epfenhofen .	-6.9057
As a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and register Meder , chose a young eagle who grows in the chicken courtyard but is then released into freedom .	-5.4612
For this purpose , the blisse Shar introduced a musical with the title " The eagle in the chicken courtyard on " .	-7.4122
Bauer found a strange egg and let it slip away from his chicken .	-4.2250
Instead of a chicken chicken , a small eagle came out .	-3.3890
But the hope to make him a chicken crumbled , the eagle spread out his wings on a high mountain and disassembling .	-6.2324
Then the three classes and four showed a chicken dance in the attribution of Yvonne Frank .	-3.3461

She wanted every four fifths to feel adopted in his new school .	-5.2372
Then we followed our thanks to our colleagues , the former head of the school , Michael Müller , who constantly jumps to teaching problems and parents .	-8.0695
The Kükenzeit is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.9136
After two years of teaching , she leaves her students very reluctantly , because it was a really great time .	-5.2260
Finally , they have been able to rely on the four-tlimc team .	-6.7171
At the end of the course , all students complete a song of summer time and holiday time .	-5.7224

Two Bulgarian people arrested for illegal camping in Greece .	-1.2016
Two Bulgarian people were arrested because of illegal camping in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted of television .	-2.6743
On the morning of 1 August , a group of people living illegally , including the two Bulgarians , was arrested in Sithonia .	-3.4415
On the same day they were released while an investigation is underway .	-2.6804
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-1.9665
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free spins and put enormous fines on everyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-5.4048
The checks will continue throughout the season .	-2.0004
The ministry said that the court could impose a fine .	-1.8458
Software Update for diesel cars : What those affected now need to know .	-4.4927
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.9619
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?	-1.8288
See the main questions and answers .	-2.7048
At the Diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW-Group software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars are available .	-4.1458
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in the emission category Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .	-4.4441
Euro 4 diesel or worse off are excluded .	-2.4607
Anja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :	-4.3489
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.5819
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-0.9329
" The committed updates previously apply only to vehicles that have cheating software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.9487
Their retrofitting has been arranged by the German Federal Office ( KBA ) .	-4.7654
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-1.6750
The manufacturers have announced rapid implementation in the coming months , but have not yet specified a precise date .	-4.8561
Daimler has announced that it would appeal to all stakeholders .	-3.4249
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be done within its framework .	-3.1208
How long will the overall upgrade be ?	-3.3964
" Great to say " says Smetanin .	-3.1555
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and on political pressure .	-4.0858
" For we have seen that the car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment " .	-5.3782
How long should the update take ?	-1.6248
The equipment itself could last only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.4031
Complex it may be to get an appointment .	-2.7302
What drivers do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.3895
The housewives are waiting for assistance .	-4.0186
It is likely that foreign manufacturers would emulate , as Smetanin .	-4.4832
Is there a heavy fall in prices in Euro 4 cars ?	-3.8843
The ACE were concerned .	-2.9724
But it is precisely in the regions where bans on flights are at risk .	-4.1307
In rural areas , there has so far been no loss of value for older diesel .	-6.1632

LL J receives Kennedy Center .	-2.6615
The Kennedy Awards gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington .	-2.8897
The first prize-giving ceremony under President Trump promises to be politically speaking .	-2.5088
One of the winners does not want to come from protest .	-2.7140
Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the sought-after awards at the renowned Kennedy Center .	-4.4644
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , and the choreographer Carmen de Lavalade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Le ( 95 ) are among the members .	-5.3360
The awards will be awarded in early December .	-2.5554
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and take part in the award together with his wife , Melania .	-3.2881
As a result , the winner of the progressive TV series , who has been published with progressive TV , has already announced that he will refrain from participating in the gala .	-6.9312
He said to the ' New York Times ' that ' this presidency has decided to completely disregard the arts and human rights - even to exempt them - and that affects me ' .	-5.2514
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasised that she would use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.7933
According to former President John F. Kennedy , the Kennedy-Zentrum is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-4.0375
The former prize winners include Meryl Streep , AreFranklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hank and Sting .	-4.0970
We make the city life worthwhile	-6.6249
Roland Waker , Haslah Stadtbaumer , will retire next year .	-3.9836
The place is already listed - suitable candidates are rare .	-3.7361
For 31 years , Waker Stadtbaumer has been a town man .	-5.3111
And the work still makes him great fun as he presents at the press discussion .	-5.2165
He reports of varied but challenging tasks waiting for his successor .	-3.6476
At the same time , he is surprised that no application is required .	-4.9724
The city is looking for an architect or building engineer at the next time .	-3.6130
In this respect , there is still plenty of time to prepare for a pick-up , taking into account the regular termination deadlines .	-8.3505
Since Haslach serves as the sub-institution of construction law , the applicant must have the appropriate qualifications .	-6.3558
Because this function certainly wants to keep the city .	-3.1417
If they could no longer fill them , citizens would have to go to open for consultation .	-4.4879
But proximity to the city is important , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and a good mood between authority and citizens .	-9.8968
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on scales with pride .	-4.2217
" We make the city worth life , " he is secure through the construction office and his staff .	-4.7782
In the future , there are also various projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Huklans and the Niederhofplatz are initiated .	-7.8175
Bollywood Studio is still on the agenda .	-6.8983
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million , " if we make it right , " Waiker estimates .	-4.3925
" All in all , great tasks await my successors .	-1.8732
The work here is fun . '	-1.3988
Fully designed for a town planter there is plenty of space .	-6.1774
Many things can be dealt with flexibly with with Haslach ’ s own building courtyard and market hall .	-7.4307
" You can move a lot " , as Waicker , and the layout of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-6.0840
As the old town as an ensemble is listed as a monument , it is important to have ' an eye for what is fit ' when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city builder stresses .	-6.1585
Their founder , based in business , is the founder of the company of independent enterprises .	-10.1804
He is the owner of the building , " in the end everything is running around my table " .	-4.8679
With the support and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neumaier ( Baubau ) has been working for ten years now , Manfred Schöner ( Lowering ) has been in charge of 15 years .	-7.9566
Also that his successors remain long , Waicker wants to see : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the spot " .	-6.5742
Because continuity is important not only for a good working climate but also for the further shape of the city .	-4.0825
According to the name of Haslach , the town of Haslach has had a long history of academic studies as a degree engineer or bachelor with technical direction architecture and has a good expertise in the field of building and construction law .	-11.0727
The Municipal Office is under high and low construction , planning of construction , basic employment , management of urban shelters , urban activity courtyard with building yard and town hall , as well as under the property rights authority .	-9.9945
Cycling down the road : barriers to the south .	-4.8046
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle off the railway track in the Leder Strasse ( B116 ) .	-6.4173
They were so badly damaged that the proximity of the freight train had to be stopped .	-4.0649
investigators take two male tatters and have tried to find them since night hours .	-6.0863
Close to the town there were witnesses of a comic scooter and a bike driver observed .	-4.3125
" This goes well beyond the " joking " movement , " said ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch to the APA .	-6.4422
The person or the perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and would also have put rail transport at risk .	-5.3955
In addition to the damage to the Lok and the plant , as well as the delay on railway and the cost of rail transport , the possibility of even pickling railway gates to the perpetrators could also be brought to the perpetrators .	-11.5122
Overall , the speaker said that the ' substantial ' amount was to be expected .	-4.8464
The damage was rectified on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic could not be carried out on the south railway track .	-6.1087
Nearly ten trains were in a Friday morning , two of them related to distance transport .	-4.9290
Goods were not withdrawn , but they were delayed .	-3.7414
According to ÖBB-Sprecher Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of upper lines had to be replaced .	-5.8409
Insulators and mast were also damaged .	-1.7934
Red meat , dairy products and chocolate may help relieve IBD ( inflammatory intestinal disease ) .	-2.6245
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-0.9764
But a new study claims the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could ease the symptoms of patients with inflammatory illnesses .	-3.4617
The incurable state , which affects about 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK , causes gastrointestinal tract and wind , recurrent or bloody diarrhea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .	-4.9223
While those affected usually find it difficult to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid droppinion of protein helps to develop immune cells that foster a tolerated intestinal .	-5.8715
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colnna , explained that cells in the intestine patrol to ensure that harmful microbes who hide in the food do not break into the body .	-9.8508
cells capable of triggering inflammation will be compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-3.4426
If the equilibrium tends to spread too far towards inflammation , it can cause an inflammatory intestinal disease .	-4.5655
In experiments it was found that a kind of tolerance immune cell occurs in mice that have a certain bacterium in its branches .	-6.3008
And the bacteria requires dropyptophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to cause the appearance of the cells .	-3.0741
Professor Colnna said : " We have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobciis reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiology , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .	-6.5513
The more dropyptophan had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells .	-2.0843
He proposed that the combination of L. reudung and one at Tryptophan rich nutrition tolerance , less inflammatory , xyetheus , if the same system also manifests in humans .	-8.1540
The postdoctoral thesis Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study drugs had such cells , but another group of the same tribal that had been separated had not .	-6.6318
They suspected that the difference had to do with the micromolecules of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-3.9848
The scouts of the mice were sequence , with six bacterial species found in mice that were present in the immune cells , but without them missing in the mice .	-6.1056
The mice have been reared in a sterile environment , so they lacked a microbiom and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. cream and the immune cells .	-7.1620
In order to understand how the bacteria mutated into the immune system , researchers L. reuteri could grow in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of the liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated from the mice .	-10.1064
The immune cells developed into the tolerated cells .	-2.3293
When the active component of the fluid has been cleaned , it proved to be a by-product of the dropyptopg Metabolism known as indoor 3-lactic acid .	-3.7066
When the researchers doubled the quantity of dropyptophan in the feed of mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when the dropyptoprate levels were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.9429
Dr Cervantes-Barragan explained that humans have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us are protecting L. confederteri in our gastrointestinal tract .	-4.7931
It is not known whether Tryptopg by-products from L. reudung develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-5.5592
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , as these cells drive inflammation on the internal surface of the intestine .	-4.2331
Potentially , high droppings in the presence of L. reudung could lead to an expansion of this population . "	-5.1291
Jose Mousrinho believes that Manchester United , with Nemanja Matic , has undertaken a " genius " .	-2.0107
At Manchester United , with Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mousrinho believes that after the middle field player had his debut against Samofia on Wednesday nights .	-4.1925
Chelsea ’ s 40 million signature began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup starts against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and culminated in the holding role as people like Paul Poggiolini and Andreas Pereira capitulated as you like .	-6.5546
Matic , however , was excluded from the preparatory Asian tour of the blues and managed only 45 minutes , making Mourinho admit that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-5.1825
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football " , said Mourinho .	-1.9007
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.3818
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Luka launched in the Aviva-Staion as Mourinho his Start XI for the start of the season .	-5.3110
The Independent revealed this week that Mousrinho had three more new obligations , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic work " to meet three of its four priority new obligations .	-4.8135
" I thank the association " , he added .	-4.4531
" I will be happy if they get four of them for me , but they have taken great trouble . "	-4.2040
" painted " Dreamliner in the sky .	-3.1673
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-2.0359
The pilots from Seattle departed in the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquete in U.S. state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which is several thousand kilometres .	-6.1202
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.9530
A Dreamliner appeared on the radar screens .	-2.4305
It was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.0665
Boeing had previously made such advertising .	-1.9388
Thus the number " 787 " and the Iron logo was painted into the sky .	-5.3051
New depth for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem . : , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.4208
As the wind turns out , when Sigmar Gabriel was still the Chief of the Social Democrat Prime Minister , he was always looking for Berlin before elections .	-5.9746
None of the party ’ s central spoilers , just no headwinds , were the most important desire of the election fighters .	-7.3373
Since Mr Schulz joined the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.5835
Since then , the staff from the Willy-Brandt-Haus have been watching with horror the events in the SP 's national capitals .	-7.3160
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not be explained with headwinds .	-3.7390
It was low .	-3.0488
That is one after another .	-7.0891
According to the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal DU provides a general signal against the coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-4.3512
" This once again shows that Red Green simply cannot rule reliably , " said CDU-Secretary Peter Tauber the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.7754
The Group ’ s surprise is that a member of the Greens / European Free Alliance has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .	-6.1333
Five months before the country election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority in opposition from the CDU and German Free Democratic Party .	-4.0493
Michael Kellner , the Executive Board of the German Greens , has asked Elke Tweesten to give back their mandate .	-6.7091
Legate into the CDU means a clear abuse of the will of the electorate .	-4.7424
Elke Tweest must return its mandate immediately , " said the German Federal Executive Officer and campaign manager of the Greens to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-12.3116
" That may not be true , " a SPD elector says , when the new slogan reaches the party central on Friday morning .	-7.7090
Stephan Weil , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without its own governing majority after leaving the Green MEP Elke Tweesten .	-6.0888
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of major and minor crises in SPD national associations .	-3.6090
And nobody knows what comes next .	-1.3949
The calamity began with the unexpectedly important defeat of the Saarland-election in March .	-4.5358
A blue eye , no more , the comrades at the time calmed down .	-3.9471
After the state elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia all will be different .	-3.0606
It was then - and it was all very much worse .	-5.8460
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln , the Düsseldorf-Wahlde party smooth .	-6.9810
In the weeks after that , the comrades receded .	-4.1422
Then , when they had the new courage at hand , the Hamburg G20 Summit came .	-4.8008
And with him came the next lowering .	-1.4954
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last powerful SPD leader , lost his niche at that weekend because he was sitting in the Elbphilharmonie while his town burned .	-4.4079
And because he subsequently made quite a mistake in crisis communication , which can be done wrong .	-6.0729
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for its political survival .	-0.9696
So now also Stephan Weil .	-2.7622
For some time now , due to the VW exhaust gases and its role in the supervisory board , the Anglo-Saxons Prime Minister has been criticised .	-5.9659
Mie poll numbers were added .	-2.6832
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for that reason , it has tried to put more and more emphasis on ecology in recent weeks .	-6.6146
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin were not hidden among the comrades around Martin Schulz .	-5.2782
They gave him the power , because they promised to stabilise the party .	-5.3280
The exact opposite may now be the case .	-2.7772
Because of this , the failure of the Greens to reach a party internal dispute is fundamentally unfounded .	-7.8544
Nor did Mr Schulz .	-3.2422

" It is intolerable and anti-democratic , as Mrs Tweesten puts her own career interests on the interests of all the others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the parties ' left in the Socialist Group , the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-6.4523
Mrs Tweesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but about the list of Saxon Green tribes .	-6.4928

In November or December , the codecision procedure will be as effective as possible so that it can start next year with the sants .	-7.4995
Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each municipality should carry out the above investigation .	-4.3426
It is a matter of evaluating the urban pathologies and deciding when to modify and to what extent .	-4.9707

Steven Northam , 33 , had placed the tiny chip between thumb and pointer implants , now offering the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by using bioTeq .	-6.3534
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultancy agency for the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants to ensure that the implant is performed according to medical standards .	-4.9819
The technology is similar to a cats and dogs containing microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-3.4450

The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.3462
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials have made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-3.3406
The helicopter was built in Connecticut , next to a National Yacht , a fire-proof car from Wisconsin and a bunch of Mississippi forklifts .	-9.5322
The White House ’ s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmented order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South avalanche , following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-5.7509
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility " , the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event his executive , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-4.2090
The news showed that the helicopter met on July 17 at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn at 15 p.m. and so long until the 11 : 00 p.m. pitch was cleared this evening .	-7.3433
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would be required for the return flight by limiting the service hours .	-4.7386
The original crew of the aircraft was present during the operation of the helicopter , while the safety staff of the unit remained on the ground during the period .	-5.8808
The records provided by TIME did not show clearly whether a second landing was ultimately required .	-5.3817
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using public property for political ends .	-3.0430
Data records show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-3.1323
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the hatch acts and we were informed that this was not the case " , wrote the commander .	-3.7646
As if you are closed , the captain replied .	-4.6355
The event " Made in America " was called the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.8370
But official events also have political overtones .	-0.9132
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he proposed the efforts to curb government rules .	-5.7268
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One , for politically beneficial purposes , is hardly a new phenomenon .	-4.0588

HMX-1 crews often carry training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to remove US presidents in the White House with precise millimeter records .	-5.0005

Helicopter units also last 11 hours during this day for non-presidential support missions .	-3.3521
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden for none of the other acquisitions presented at the event .	-3.7097
One speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter at the South Lawn .	-3.5720

The first aircraft to be operated by the Navy Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia was held in 30 minutes .	-10.7376
The White House argues that the actual cost of aircraft operations is far below that rate .	-3.8204
" Set taxpayers ' costs on the basis of the estimates for reimbursement is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-5.5197
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "	-2.9454
According to a RAND study from 2015 , DoD refunds do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .	-4.1471
At this time , the former White House Press Secretary , Sean Spicer , championed the use of the helicopter for the event .	-3.4046
" The idea is to present things this week that are made in America " , said Spicer .	-2.9100
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of contributing to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , are dependent on it .	-3.4447
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.3062
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . '	-3.7977
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he took his tour of South Lawn for the event , but he set himself in the driver seat of a firecar .	-6.1184
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky , and creted with the media about his own fleet of company products .	-4.2772

How America can Damage the OMV	-1.4154
Donald Trump really did not seem happy when he put his signature under the law to strengthen sanctions against Russia .	-4.3664

Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce are concentrating strongly on the local community and the Glasgow region , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social discrimination .	-5.6682
Thus , under the prospect of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , the rising cost of living and chronic production fall , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving production presence in McAVitie .	-5.5143
One speaker from Mr Pladis said : ' The filibuster at Genoa has received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we value the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.7956

As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , no one is dealing with " disgraceful and shameful actions " that should be punished and prevented in the future ; it is striking , however , the " degree of media manipulation " , the author Lucietta Scaraffia , Historian and member of the national Bioethics committees .	-7.7132
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , " says Scaraffia .	-4.9094
In the interview with the Bayerische Rundfunk , the Princely Choir of Thurn and Taxis also said : " You can go to the and !	-10.0827
She also pointed out that , in her youth , ' was a completely normal educational means ' to be finished with young children , as I was one ' .	-6.4566
It would be unfair to apply today 's standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.7840
In connection with the reports on the abuses , Papal brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-4.3160
Quite wrongly , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who , with Ratzinger , wrote the " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-4.2458
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-4.3266
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the Congregation for the Enlightenment ?	-5.0095
A total of 547 hotels located between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s , " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 wearing girls sexual abuse .	-6.9706
In the final report , it is said to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg until 1994 : " To sum up , it can be said that in many cases , physical and mental violence has been used by Domkapelle R.	-6.9930
Particularly in high emotionality , punishment for students could be stronger .	-3.8453
Yet , contrary to many other accused people , many victims value the general humanity of R. R. R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him , despite violence . '	-6.8191
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regency Domspam , while Georg Ratzinger is .	-7.4152
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the " incidents of violence of guards in the rain baths " gives a stark picture of Domkapelle Georg Ratzinger .	-7.6881
On the one hand , many students highlight their " humanity " .	-2.5486
On the other hand , he also appears to be a hypocrite and perfectionist , who became a reality of the social scene when a Domspetz did not perform a musical performance .	-11.7015
How do you see this final report as being biographer ?	-3.5620
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name of Georg Ratzinger is there .	-7.3964
He is dedicated to eight pages and he is clearly free of any suspicion of the complicity or co-knowledge in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-6.5444
The excessive violence at pre-school was also outside its sphere of influence .	-3.7536
It can only be accused of being too late or of not being taken seriously enough by initial insinuations .	-5.6037
The specialist specialist at the specialist gymnasium , where he worked , was considered - so literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-6.4276
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also makes an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " as extremely good teachers , who regularly gave the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always sold grapes from children " .	-7.1389
Only a minority complained about his desirability and his high emotionality , which even led to bouts of change .	-6.9928
He himself acknowledged , deeply regrets , and apologists for years ago , that he was not only putting his clothes on the floor with stools and the key league .	-12.0492
But it must be said that in the time in question , in the 1960s and 1970s , such education methods were widespread , with parents and teachers alike .	-5.7339
Are you also aware of this breeding method ?	-2.9543
Of course , I am thinking of all of us born before 1968 .	-2.6774
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a national college .	-3.9781
That is , of course , compared to what this report is about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and excessive violence at the pre-school .	-5.3800
One wonders whether it has more to do with his popularity and his role than his brother for Benedict XVI , that many media have just been up to him .	-7.7694
After all , many people who have never understood it are still working diligently at the Bavarian Pope .	-3.9597
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-3.2657
In the media , a great deal has been said about the issue of abuse in the rains .	-5.9506
Will Georg Ratzinger also bear responsibility for any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-2.9075
Michael Hesemann : No .	-1.9327
No one in the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted to the master of the Cathedral .	-4.6434
Not even parents were dedicated .	-1.2216
" I never managed to speak with my father or my mother on this , " said a man named for the others , " I was very embarrassed " .	-5.6950
The real problem in Enlightenment was sexual abuse and is that most victims are silent from shame .	-3.9137
If they were not even loyal to parents and to their ears , then they certainly do not become a leader of the choir , who would have been , in a way , a colleague of the perpetrator for the job .	-10.3253
How do the Domitian Ratziner assess the role in the event of abuse ?	-6.9797
Michael Hesemann : A interviewed student put it like : " For sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) would have had timely evidence and could have stopped the person responsible .	-8.0801
I think it is also quite absurd to think that it has opened up to him , either openly or more , than to their parents , heads of state , teachers , etc .	-9.2911
That one speaks about sex with him ... - unthinkable . "	-2.6149
The report thus came to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils and / or their surroundings entrusted to him in advance was not confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' .	-6.9110
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore speaking of everyone who knows .	-4.0066
He may not be accused of not having prevented or revealed him .	-4.3736
There is therefore no reason to link his good names with these heinous crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.4036
In the media there was much to read about " excessive violence " during the rains Domsoos .	-6.1540
The former Domkapelle Georg Ratzinger is accused of taking a look at the trail report .	-4.5925
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-1.9387
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that the report mixes up everything and fell into a huge Melange of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-6.6108
This is , however , an abuse of the report .	-2.7837
In fact , it is clean enough : between the pre-school school and the high school of the Domikum , between sexual abuse and excessive violence , and , let us say , other criticisms .	-8.5054
In addition , the report has been dealing with incidents dating back to 1945 , including four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not the leader of the Domiken .	-5.6155
The whole horrific teaching of thought , the cases in which the rapists of sadistic teachers were systematically harassed and tortured , and which suffered horrific consequences , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions have prevailed .	-7.7698
But with those Domkapelle Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with , for he got the boys first to face when they were already at the Domitian Fashion .	-6.7831
On that , as the vast majority of witnesses emphasise , the subject of " pre-school " was taboo .	-4.8206
One was only happy to escape and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradisian " conditions .	-4.7212
What was different at the specialist specialist gymnasium ?	-4.7123
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but not a sadistic violence .	-4.6609
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , who concluded the report that ' many victims valued the general humanity of R. R. and therefore in many cases even combine positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-6.2434
At the most , the charges remain for checking out .	-5.9140
Yet , despite all the efforts , the report could define only two periods of time in which it was reported by the conditions at the pre-school .	-5.7182
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the events at a school where he was not performing and responsible ( so the witness ) he did not want to hear , and then again until 1993 .	-6.5392
Did Georg Ratzinger stop in the state consistent his ears ?	-5.0397
Michael Hesemann : No , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the specialist specialist specialist specialist , who even reproduces the report .	-4.8910
He points this out that " the practice of caning continues in the pre-school " .	-6.2378
He recommended urgent intervention , given the danger of negative press releases .	-3.1187
That was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when caning punishment was banned in Bavaria .	-5.6931
Before that , they came in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-3.6557
It has also been difficult to assess where the parties concerned may have been exaggerated or dramatic , and where the permitted limit was actually exceeded .	-7.2066
However , one could not say that he would always have looked different .	-5.2459
That is simply not true .	-1.5088
Only in 1980 was the official dismissal of schools in Bavaria .	-3.4976
In Gloria of Thurn and Taxis , he claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to what was then .	-5.6798
How do you see that ?	-1.6067
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the ' case strip of the anachronism ' , in other words the danger of judging past moral standards today .	-5.6099
The Princely is right there .	-3.6137
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which has been disgusting at all times , nor to what has happened in the pre-school school in crimes and violence on innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond the usual .	-7.9551
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being opened up .	-3.2038
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.9338
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say , to bring hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970 ’ s .	-6.0624
When physical punishments were then banned , he also kept strictly there .	-5.1471
What image of his rain time has Georg Ratzinger played in the talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.2109
Kam the theme of caning also in language ?	-3.2665
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , in other words Pope Benedict XVI , tells us of his perspective , as the cathedral played only one side role .	-6.5359
Nevertheless , I am not in any way unaware that he was regime regime in these areas .	-6.6447
But that must also be said : without this obsession , without the imperative discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class art , true cultural ambassador of Europe and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-12.7293
With Keeps and bonbons alone , we are not making a big singers and every success , whatever field , but discipline , passion and self-persuasion .	-7.8201
How did you see Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-4.6760
Michael Hesemann : Due to the work on the book and beyond , I really have met Georg Ratzinger very well and always experienced as a wonderful , humorous , peacefull , deep faith and a good person , from which one cannot imagine that he could only do something to fly .	-8.7399
I regularly get along with how many former Domiken still today , 23 years after his demise , keep him regularly in touch with him , read him - he is almost blind and treat him as a member of her family .	-7.0038
So those who , until now , do not admit that he was strictly with them are clearly in the minority .	-5.1619
Most of the local delicacies today are grateful to him for making her life more enriched and bringing them closer to the world of music .	-5.9860
And that he was always a good , father - a strict father , certainly that may be - but he was also a amiable respect person to whom they still look up and which they worship .	-7.6955
Once again , I would like to make it quite clear that all the things that you are proposing are educational methods which were on the agenda at that time .	-7.4439
We can be glad that we have been able to overcome this time long ago .	-3.2635
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is more prominent and has an even more prominent brother to the media scapegoat .	-3.9107
That is all too obvious for the bad .	-3.0391
Because the report that has just been published relieves it .	-3.2354
Now , for the sake of decency , a 27-year-old man who has acquired great merits , and without who is outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany would not yet know the rain-priest Cathedral at last .	-10.3068
