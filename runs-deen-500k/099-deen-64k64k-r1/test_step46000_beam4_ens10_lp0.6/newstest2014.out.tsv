Consultancy : Still more pedestrians safety	-4.8915
There is no distance of 100 meters from each other . On Tuesday , the new B 33-Frank-theatre at the village parking site was put in place - in sight of the older town hall sample .	-8.4312
Two installations so close together : intention or depiction ?	-5.9832
This question clearly answered by the Mayor yesterday .	-3.8080
" The town hall sample was installed at that time because it secures the school way " , explained corners yesterday .	-5.0548
The Kluser-lit traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain residents .	-5.1801
The plant which was officially installed yesterday is important for the cross area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-3.1576
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-6.8747
" In the high volume of traffic and pedestrian traffic , another traffic light had to be safety , " said Eckert .	-6.4182
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the State Council of Offenbach .	-2.7663
" According to current measurements , about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Advisers on the B 33 daily , about 10 % of which are heavy traffic , " Arnold stresses .	-5.7950
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : ' Safety is simply happening here ' , so Arnold .	-5.5703
All in all , four traffic visits were carried out , a traffic-circle was also considered , but was discarded because of the closeness to the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-7.7403
According to Arnold , everything was tested in the selection of ampelmasates before : " With an extra long wood-burning truck that is loaded with us we have mastered whether these vehicles can travel to B 33 from the Sulzbachweg , without turning the ampelmasen into a pen " .	-12.4259
The approximately EUR 15 000 expensive traffic light system itself is the " most modern thing that currently exists on the market " , explained Arnold .	-4.7739
The complex is equipped with colored LEDs , which make it clear that the lights are good to see the lights from the drivers , for example , even the sun from above .	-9.3924
And it is economical : the older light plants use about 100 watts , the new one just eight watts .	-4.3602
There are three light systems per direction .	-2.6322
Arnold explained the technology of the new system : it is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.7542
Meanwhile the pedestrians turn the traffic light button and the upper radar tests .	-5.3281
If the road is free , the green comes immediately for the pedestrians , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.7937
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be closed for the pedestrians .	-3.2871
" If a group or people with disabilities go through the streets , the green season will be extended , so everyone is sure to come across the road " , explained Arnold .	-5.8732
Of course , drivers have to think here as partners and watch the road .	-5.3765
This was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the traffic light for pedestrians green , noise through a high class car - in light red .	-6.0115
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-3.3836
The disasters of his Catholic village life - the lack of language , the slope to raw violence and silent sexuality , the closeness and joy - have frequently described the Carinthian poet .	-6.5670
The award of the Büchner is well-known above all as a director , theatre texts are scarce in his work .	-7.7519
Collage from Prosatlength Gerhard Frederier represents for his performance " Wettlights on the Zunfeld " , which is now visible in the garage X at St. Peter 's Square , therefore a collage of Prosatüber .	-12.0799
The theatre maker connects elements of the autobiography " Der Leibher " ( 1987 ) with celebrities from " the body , its family standing " ( 2003 ) .	-8.9894
On the largely lectured stage - important quiver : a delicate sofa , where the hint is copied and masterworks - the eight-person ensemble is mixed with the text material .	-7.8933
In doing so , director Fredrihner seems to have little faith in the text .	-4.5436
The 70-minute performance overstates the submission with a multitude of register cases , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms of play .	-4.3078
The actors , in particular , came up with the sometimes dubious aesthetic implementations .	-5.0950
They are austere , dipped with the head in water , soaking up the wall with their evening problems .	-5.5736
Interfaces in cell ophan or flat , they descend on dangerously high heels through the performance , either croticising them loud or are completely silenced in the stage floor .	-10.3665
But the text does not spread in this heavy way .	-6.2572
The best moments of the evening when sung - the string ranges from Deep Purple to popular lyrics .	-5.1941
It is only against the end that the overcast performance comes up with something to relax and to make Winyer look like an absurdity .	-8.4597
A black box in your car ?	-1.6347
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highgateway system , and believe that the solution is found in a small black box that finds every car in the Armaturlist .	-6.2851
The equipment that record any kilometres of risk and report the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the State planning offices to review the obsolete system for financing American roads .	-5.1595
The more boring area of road planning has suddenly generated an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-3.9603
Liberians have joined forces with environmental groups and argue that the government can use small boxes to record the harmless kilometers – and possibly also where they have gone – and that the information can then be used to calculate tax .	-6.6748
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.5097
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.5730
But , while Congress cannot agree on what is happening , several states are no longer waiting .	-3.5116
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay for a safe Meire .	-5.9938
Thousands of car drivers have already tested the speedometer , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-3.5574
This is really a must for our country .	-1.5736
“ It is nothing that we will only be able to use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , managing director of the Southern California Ass. of Governats , who plans to record the blocked miles on all California car drivers from 2025 .	-6.4385
The way we pay those taxes will change .	-2.2546
The technology for this is there .	-1.6408
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , funded from taxes paid by US Americans at the pump , is bankrupt .	-3.1672
But in America , no longer gets as much as before .	-4.3066
Cars consume less petrol .	-1.3383
The government oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone ( less than 4 cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-2.6562
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax by just one cent when it comes to high fuel prices .	-4.8066
“ The petrol tax is simply not sustainable , ” Lee Munnick , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.5026
Its federal government has recently equipped 500 cars with a tachograph to test a smart-based payment system .	-5.9332
“ This is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-2.4733
Bureaucratic bureaucrats call it a randomly based operator fee .	-4.1853
It is no surprise that the idea of urban liberals finds a consensus , for for example , the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced .	-5.1270
The Californian planners rely on the system in developing strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally agreed targets on climate change .	-4.6961
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also said that he sees the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.3025
The free marketers of the Readson Foundation are also inspired by the idea of paying drivers according to a predetermined route .	-6.1612
“ This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole , ” said Adrian Moore , Vice President of Policy at Reagan .	-3.4026
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.6402
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers , who , in a report in 2011 , called on Congress to move towards indicative accounts .	-4.4222
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million project project last year , covering 10,000 cars .	-3.2701
But the majority of the House of Representatives avoided attempts and thus responded to the concerns of rural Members who represent people who often have to walk many miles on the way to work or to the city in everyday life .	-6.6805
Several states and cities nevertheless move in their own right .	-4.1086
The most busy is in Oregon , which currently offers 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-4.0281
These drivers will soon pay the mileage charges instead of the Federal Reserve Tax .	-3.9733
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.3070
New York City is also considering this .	-1.7324
Illinois is a city in the north of the world .	-6.2428
And the I-95-coalition , which includes the Ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-4.1150
The concept is not a universal tune .	-1.6941
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently provided with the equipment , drivers were skeptical of the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-3.9487
“ Fear of Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” said Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management in the Ministry of Transport of Nevada .	-4.6575
People did not want it .	-1.3946
When the test ran , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into fully-fledged monitoring devices . ”	-4.3537
There is no need to build a gigantic , unwieldy technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on individuals ’ daily movements .	-2.6767
Nevada is one of many states that are now looking for affordable technology that the state can capture the harmless kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-5.2433
That , so Khan , would also make the public more reassuring .	-4.5774
Hunting this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.2146
The company was not initially elected to help states tax car drivers .	-4.5661
Rather , it was their goal to take steps in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of the safe miles .	-5.6490
However , the devices that you have tested are also interesting for the road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is uploaded regularly via modem .	-6.0730
“ People are more willing to participate in it if their speed and location are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , CEO of True Mileage .	-5.1235
In some of these public pilot programs , big mistakes were made .	-3.3117
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-3.2341
In Oregon , the planners are experimenting with giving motorists a number of choice .	-3.6477
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.7045
Or they choose no equipment at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of miles safe by all the citizens of the state .	-5.3184
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of distrustful public opinion by providing more functions than with the more necessary devices .	-5.4042
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a vehicle for taxation that can pay for parking fees , insurance only for medium kilometers , and speed data is collected by other vehicles in real time , which allows drivers to avoid congestion .	-8.3125
“ Driving drivers would be motivated by the added value of the advantages offered by the system to participate , ” said in a city planning document .	-4.2772
However , some transport planners wonder whether the whole talk about pay per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-5.6587
In the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , the Congress could simply resolve the problem of a bankrupt Trust Highway Fund by increasing fuel tax .	-4.0202
An additional one-time fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little fuel , so that they also pay a fair share .	-5.6064
“ There is no reason for an operation if an Aspirin is also sufficient , ” said Randy Rentmär , the head for Commission legislation and public affairs .	-5.3760
If we do this , hundreds of millions of lorry drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .	-3.3208
Königsfeld : Small team beats beats .	-3.1527
The volunteers provided their autumn general test despite staff shortages with Bramente .	-7.0329
Only 11 men participated in the exercise .	-2.0209
In his practice he chose the mansion in the Burgberger Strasse .	-5.2110
In the case of saw a short circuit should be created .	-5.9392
Two people were injured by the rise in the fire and smoke development , but one of them could still send a emergency call .	-5.3812
After the first review of the situation , Hans Kammerer agreed to enter the building .	-3.5595
After a short time , it was possible to find the first person and run into free .	-4.6094
The second person had to be worn .	-1.3572
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.2058
The building , a workshop with integrated ventilation for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.1747
It had a lot of wood and also a straw ball in it .	-4.3246
Furthermore there were also electrical machines for wood processing .	-3.0734
The first extinction attack took place over the tank in the vehicle .	-2.4490
Another assignment was to fly the Hydrat at about 100 meters .	-6.3582
There have now been three fire attacks .	-2.8213
A hollow jet tube was used in the building as well .	-3.3503
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what is to be done with very little at the disposal of .	-6.1325
In the worst case , support is given over the daily activities group Königsfeld .	-5.3015
The commander was satisfied with the expiration of the exercise .	-1.9462
The networking of universities and companies	-2.8195
On his visit to the district Breisgau-Hochwald land president Guido Wolf was able to clear about where the workforce of tomorrow came from .	-7.0626
In cooperation with the leading school managers of the profession schools as well as the county specialist and the parent committee chairman of this important issue , he attended the training centre in Germany .	-9.8997
" Education is an important factor in the location " , Claudia Granle , Director of the Hans-Thoma-school , who presented the inter-connected school project " Hochwald " .	-7.5266
Wolf was impressed with the model projects for training .	-3.7951
Since 2011 , a successful collaboration between the railway centre , the district specialist and vocational school centre has existed in the City of Walderstadt .	-7.8100
He also praised the family friendliness in the county .	-3.3203
" It is important not only to have a family phase looking at , but also , because of demographic change , the phase of caring for relatives , " said Wolf .	-5.4395
He also noted that more and more workers care and care for their families .	-3.6847
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can result in an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.8278
But no one can afford to lose qualified labor , he said .	-2.5292
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-2.3955
" For anyone who has experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , his acquired knowledge and skills often remain with the regional economy , which contributes to the strengthening of the region " , the country ’ s president was convinced .	-6.5120
Because only if there were enough training places could be covered by specialist legislation .	-5.3658
In his opinion , the district 's location advantage is its advantageous location in the south-west of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.9193
In addition , he witnessed the efforts already made to expand public transportation at his railroad trip to Freiburg .	-6.9058
" Stay stubbornly and ensure that public transport becomes better , " he explained to the address of local politicians present .	-4.1730
With music an entertaining afternoon .	-3.8341
For 15 years now the Kaul family invites the Dieher seniors to coffee , cakes and afterwards to a Vecder .	-5.1514
In the past , older citizens were treated in the resting grounds .	-4.7475
This afternoon is taking place in the shelter of St. Josef .	-3.9411
The locals were thrilled by the delicious cakes and cakes .	-3.2844
Later , there were cold salt .	-4.9207
With popular melodies , Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimme .	-4.5228
The over 100 years old natural stone wall as a front line of the former school farm in front of the church road is to be re-placed on the reconstruction cost plan of the city .	-8.9064
In the days before the Kildare , a small angle wall was built in the first works of the front school 's rehabilitation , for stabilization and static discharge of the more than a hundred years old stone wall with Balustrade .	-8.6999
Further action is to include the planning of the National Palace Office , such as Alexander Misok , the National Palace Office , and to create a regeneration concept for the old wall .	-9.2255
Afterwards , the calculation will be carried out by experts , who will then be put on the table to the Council of Ministers for decision and to decide on how to proceed .	-8.0783
A decision on this will probably come next year .	-3.1155
After the refurbishment , refurbishment and construction of the old school farm within the two sides of the 1912 built school , the necessity of dismantling the needy wall must be laid down in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure , the necessity and of new .	-9.3077
The historical wall of the old school yard on the Kirchstraße , a hundred years old , is above all due to water and frost damage , since no drainage is present , needs to be gentrified and has an imbalance in the front . .	-10.9767
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to climatic damage , but the wall is not currently under threat .	-3.5240
A stability wall is required for one of the students using a schoolyard , which has been fixed by the current keyboarders .	-7.1901
Originally , school enrollment was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure caused a postponement .	-4.7154
An important word about the historic school architecture , which has even been used for film recordings , is included in the National Palace .	-7.3513
In case of demands from this site , the city will hope to receive grants from the town reserve owners .	-9.0974
The primary school students who are now taught in a well-reconstructed old school building with new Aula will soon be able to use the old school courtyard .	-6.2181
Özdemer wants to get jazz training in Stuttgart .	-3.7063
In the ongoing discussions about the future of music colleges in Baden-Wurttemberg also turned on Cem Özdemer , the chairman of the Greens .	-4.9218
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training in the Superior School of Stuttgart " , said Özdemer the " Stuttgart news " .	-4.8628
Jazz and classical are just at the heart of Stuttgart ’ s jazz centre .	-8.0259
Thus , Özdemer , who is the favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate during the federal election on September 22 , contradicts the regional government .	-5.9947
On the basis of an expert study , it reinforces a reorganisation of the five musical colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.4983
Afterwards , the study course of jazz and pop will be moved from the School of Music in Stuttgart to the University of Mannheim .	-7.2415
U.S. border : " Super-Tunnel " discovered to drug smuggling .	-3.2816
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and closed a ' super tunnel ' to drug smuggling .	-2.3723
As US customs authorities said , the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , rail tracks and an air ventilation system .	-3.8880
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of Marihuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine .	-2.2858
The tunnel has not yet been used , according to the specification .	-6.3657
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig themselves across the radar , " said the general prosecutor of the U.S. District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference before a stockhouse in San Diego , where an end to the tunnel was discovered .	-7.7704
" If your tunnel continues to build such tunnels and tries to use them , we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-5.1354
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in continuous combat of drug cartels .	-2.5561
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with crime .	-2.4685
Constructed by experts	-2.0222
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took about one year .	-4.6923
The railway station was so equipped that electric cars could be used there .	-3.3884
On the Mexico side , access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-3.5709
According to the authorities , a head takes 20 metres deep into the actual tunnel entrance .	-4.0445
The tunnel has a section of 1.20 meters high and 90 centimeters wide .	-2.8976
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-2.8052
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the coca and was arrested .	-2.5325
The third , a Mexicans , was taken for the confiscated Marihuanas .	-4.3687
All three are threatened with life imprisonment as officials have said .	-3.6056
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , the press conference in San Diego continued .	-5.7645
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction .	-3.3999
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts and not through tunnel .	-2.5117
This is evidence of the desperation of drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of drug addiction DEA in San Diego .	-4.5357
They would do everything to get to the US .	-1.6170
No details were disclosed about the detainees , at least one was Mexicans .	-3.5225
They must reckon with prison sentences of up to ten years .	-2.1295
2014 becomes Geisinger ’ s Festyear	-4.2012
The anniversary of the city of Geising on the occasion of the 1250 .	-3.7934
A return to the first documents is coming closer and closer .	-3.5486
When the year ends in a good eight weeks time , the anniversary is over .	-5.9629
For the first time , works by means of musical instruments are composed of violin and church houses .	-8.2339
The church has a certificate in which both places are mentioned .	-4.4421
On the 15th of March there will be an official start for the anniversary of the anniversary , and as Geisingsingen does not currently have a hall , this event will take place in the town , where both were mentioned for the first time in 1250 years ago .	-8.0234
A number of events are planned in Geisingen , as well as in church houses .	-3.4709
The church house will be held in July on a weekend of 18 to 20 July .	-4.8048
We are celebrating once again .	-3.7260
On Friday with a festive act , on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall .	-3.0644
At this weekend there is also the church church church church . , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.3581
The city ’ s musical director Rudolf Barth wrote a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary .	-5.4134
On 21 June together with the Black Forest Association ’ s Sonnwendèche ceremony , on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks , and on 13 December the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-7.1400
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary of the anniversary , the official date is on the last September weekend , September 27 and 28 .	-5.6744
A new chronicle will be published on the occasion of the violin festival .	-4.3386
" A chronik is not only to be performed by Geisingen , but rather a printed work about the Geising of today , which is made up of violins , church houses , Leipferdingen , Aullen and Gutmadingen are " , as Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-10.0476
And today ’ s violinist of today ’ s 2014 birthday was celebrated in 1974 .	-4.8789
The new chronology will be present in Geising on November 21 or 22 in the new Festhall .	-4.8404
2014 , however , is another year with many anniversaries .	-3.0092
The Narrender Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a custom evening on its 60-year existence , the harmony Gutmadingen becomes 90 years and has the fixed bench on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-7.8502
The Altenmuseum is 40 years old , the Geisinger school has been at the new site for 50 years and is celebrating this on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymns Leipzig will be built 150 years old and it will be celebrated within the framework of the Brunfest from 4 to 7 July .	-8.7211
The town of Geisingsingsingsingen has been mentioned for the first time in the year 764 documents in a gift document owned by the St. Gallen monastery .	-6.1954
The certificate was made in churches ( houses ) , which was then court place .	-4.2622
Both communities are therefore mentioned on the same certificate .	-2.9241
In addition , the Municipal Council has returned 40 years to celebrate this 1250 years accordingly .	-5.0046
The Council is targeting railway stations .	-3.1444
Should the transfer of train " Am Hirschen " be time-consuming to increase traffic safety ?	-4.7965
Yes , local councils have decided .	-2.2319
It is necessary to get EUR 220 000 in your hands .	-5.3268
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kininger Line next year .	-4.0474
Especially the safety of railway passes is to be increased - on a regular basis there is a collision of trains with other vehicles across Germany .	-5.6537
If communities vote to rebuild , they will have to take part with one third in the cost , the rest share railways and the federal government .	-6.4649
Roland Grißers ' town manager explained to the Municipal Council the specific characteristics of the Bahang ' Am Hirschen ' .	-6.2434
There , the city plans to build an inspection service to the west of the railway track at the height of the tunnel tunnel tunnel tunnel tunnel .	-6.5559
There , even larger vehicles , such as those that carry longwood , could be standing at counter traffic without blocking the rails .	-7.8942
Grienholder therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could subsequently become more widespread in due course to ensure smooth flow of traffic .	-5.5602
This was controversial in the municipal council , because some Councils felt that there was a need to expand the road : Thomas Kick put the atmosphere of critics at the point : ' Do we have to take so much money on the grounds of so few vehicles ? '	-8.3082
Mayor Thomas Haas said : the railway transfer " Hirschen " will be used regularly for Longwood transportation .	-4.5995
Even wood from the " Kueberbach " area will be transported partially through this route , because up to 20 meters of long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .	-7.2131
Moreover , the journey as a transfer for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-4.2479
There is no doubt that the Kirchberg and the Schlossberg tunnel should be rebuilt and refurbished , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway transfer " Am Hirschen " could also provide an important means of transport for a longer period of time .	-7.5859
Councils agreed to investigate what costs would result in road broadening .	-4.6355
In spite of this , the majority agreed to the reconstruction of the railway strip with the requirement that the necessary supporting wall should be built in such a way that the city could then develop the road " Bahnhofstraße " , if necessary , for meeting traffic on some 5.5 meters .	-10.1416
The reconstruction of the railway passage at the time of the Nord / Belgian / Germany / Austria / Germany / Austria / Germany / Germany / Germany could , however , lead to a very different problem which affects the access in .	-19.1330
The administration had to investigate the reconstruction plans of the railway from the Steaminger office , as it had doubts about whether the scheduled construction of the Geroletzhaus Wege was still possible .	-8.5581
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not to be excluded that the road 's drift conditions could lead to longer seats .	-7.1156
The city , in turn , bears the responsibility for this as a road worker .	-5.9480
The restructuring could therefore lead to conflicts of liability .	-2.9250
Because both the timber downtrodden and the demolition of the current state of construction worked , one should not agree to the restructuring , Haas argued .	-7.1883
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of turn with a vehicle on the move is much lower than the other train passes , because there is a good line of sight directly next to the center .	-8.6397
Even trains from the main railway station should already be braking at this point that no collision threat would occur .	-5.0374
The reconstruction of this railway strip was refused to be approved several times , as the city of reed had to avoid the problem with parked cars , so the Councils were able to withdraw from the responsibility after the construction was completed .	-11.1961
As unproblematic , the body considers the modifications to the railway routes " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuchenbach " , for which there have already been crossing agreements with the train .	-6.9109
Esa decides on large space missions : mission for billions .	-4.0631
Future planets , gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the next few years .	-3.9384
30 proposals stood for selection , five are still in the race .	-2.4420
Far worlds .	-1.4215
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets by other stars .	-2.8149
No one knows whether there is at least some of them .	-3.1645
The selection is hard : to search for gravitational waves ?	-3.9939
Or rather explore the origins of the cosmos ?	-2.0752
Or on earth like that , and perhaps beyond earth life ?	-5.3465
These questions are the responsibility of the European Space Agency Esa .	-3.6159
They are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make research much more important .	-5.2422
The budget for such ' L-missions ' is about EUR 1 billion each .	-2.4546
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-2.2246
In Paris at the beginning of September , the elite of European space research met to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.5043
30 ideas were on the debate , five of them have now entered the closer election .	-4.3578
There are a number of agencies which examine the proposals , catch up with researchers .	-5.1307
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-3.0955
In total , four big questions have selected the Esa to find answers to the 2007 project " Cosmic Vision " .	-5.2363
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.4018
The exact processes in the formation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-4.8037
A large infrared spectrum in the whole area could push through this dark .	-3.4200
And if a planet has a planet under which circumstances can life arise ?	-3.4543
To address this issue , the space telescope " Cheops " is to start in 2017 , which will examine more closely the 500 existing planetary systems in our surroundings .	-6.8859
But the possibilities are limited , Cheps is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.0862
With larger instruments , astronomers could form a similar planet and even analyze the composition of their referees and thus search for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-6.1623
How does the solar system work ?	-0.9205
This question should also ultimately provide information on the conditions for the creation of life .	-4.9443
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role as well as the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation emanating from it with the planetary system .	-3.6778
In our solar system these processes can be investigated in a exemplary manner .	-4.6756
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already approved a M-class mission ( there is the budget of about EUR half billion ) for this question .	-6.9478
The probe should start 2017 and closely monitor the surface and activity of the sun .	-3.1702
The researchers are also at Jupiter and his moons of great interest .	-5.9045
They want to know the role played by the giant planet in the development of the solar system .	-2.7280
For this , the Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the ' Cosmic Vision ' programme .	-4.6954
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) starts its journey in 2022 .	-3.2951
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and is intended to explore the atmosphere of the planet , as well as the icy Monde Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-5.4532
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.6416
The universe offers many opportunities to study material under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know still apply there .	-5.6594
Perhaps there are also differences that could lead the physics to a new theory under which all known laws unite .	-5.1547
What was the universe created and what did it consist of ?	-2.9319
Our cosmos was born in the Great Lake in 13.7 billion years ago .	-4.7811
Apart from the material we know about , from the stars , planets and living beings we exist , there is a dark matter where galaxies and galaxy clusters are combined , and dark energy is accelerating the expansion of the space .	-8.7677
Until now , researchers know which physical laws were valid in the first two fractions of the big bang , and from the dark matter and the shiny energy .	-7.6561
With " Euclid " the Esa has already approved an M-mission here , the launch of which is scheduled for 2020 .	-4.2582
With a special telescope , the probe should investigate the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the sky and allow conclusions on the nature of dark matter and foam energy .	-7.1867
Who could make the race	-1.5720
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.5224
In the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , the best opportunity for granting as an L-mission is a demanding concept for demonstrating gravitational waves .	-6.7107
Among these physicists are changes to the structure of the spatial time predicted by Albert Einstein nearly 100 years ago .	-5.3308
They have still not been rejected .	-1.9679
Elisa could create this , and scientists hope for it .	-3.9406
The mission provides one out of two or three probes with the existing detector that is stationed in the entire .	-4.3287
In contrast to plants on the earth , it could also prove gravity waves that were generated by the big bang , providing new insights about the origins of the cosmos .	-7.0242
Four further proposals compete for the second L mission : a major X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planet of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to surveying the Cosmic background radiation , and the " Explanetary Finder " , which is to set up and investigate the similar planet .	-6.6891
Already abandoned , proposals for manual handling from Mars , for the exploration of moon , Venus and asteroid as well as for solar physics .	-6.4627
Snowden ’ s prepared to “ collaborate ” with Germany in US surveillance .	-2.9614
Edward Snowden , the US intelligence service ’ s whistalive , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag that the American National Security Agency and its director , Keih Alexander , do not provide answers to their activities .	-6.3728
The German Member , Hans-Christian Ströbel , met Snow in Russia on Thursday , where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-5.4703
In a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , “ Even if the outcome of my effort has been positive , my government continues to treat a different opinion as a good guardian and tries to criminalise political expression with a threat to prosecution , where no defence is possible . ”	-8.1002
The truth is not a crime .	-1.5344
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to let him fall in charge .	-5.4213
The charges brought by the US Department of Justice cover espionage and theft of state assets .	-3.2604
The German Minister of the Interior , Hans-Peter Friedrich said online about time : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives , then we find ways to do that . ”	-5.4961
Relations between the US and Germany have been strained by the allegations that the NSA have ignored German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.9234
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should take the opportunity to listen to Snow as a witness when it is possible to ' without jeopardising it and completely destroy relations with the United States ' .	-6.2036
Ströv , a member of the Greens , published an image of himself and snow in his Twitter crop .	-4.6847
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-0.9373
As the lawyer in the former NA-employee , Snowden said that he cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-4.9884
If Snowden sends a message to Germany , he needs an assurance that he is ‘ safe ’ there , the honourable Member .	-5.4494
Snowden explains in his letter that he would be exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that has driven him out of his homeland .	-4.6142
It is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-3.0982
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a good thing to the general public .	-4.2011
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation were resolved . ”	-3.7274
Frontier Airlines charges on hand baggage	-2.2493
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers wishing to stow away on their flight of hand baggage .	-3.8770
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to 100 US dollars in a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or Limonade , even if it was announced on Wednesday that passengers should keep the full can .	-5.4957
The new fee applies to hand baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-3.2413
Frontier explained that one calculated $ 25 when the fee is paid in advance and $ 100 for travelers who only paid on the platform .	-6.1424
Frontier speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the charge of $ 100 is intended to move travellers to pay in advance .	-5.8332
“ We don ’ t want this sum to be calculated , ” she explained .	-2.7538
Airlines started to charge the first and second piece of baggage for the first and second .	-4.7336
Passengers who tried to avoid them have joined their hand luggage as much as possible , which means that they are often full of bags over their seat .	-7.7263
Charges are one way of moving passengers less on board .	-3.2064
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-2.5488
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier , who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space on the head .	-5.0863
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-2.7442
This means that a passenger may take a piece of baggage free of charge on the front-board , but the next person must pay 100 dollars for a equivalent piece of baggage .	-6.0164
O 'Malley explained that Frontier ’ s website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers should be informed about the charge before they reach the gate .	-5.6096
The new personal baggage charge of Frontier only comes into force in the summer , and there is still no precise date .	-6.2596
Passengers often travel over baggage charges and other charges , but airlines like to pick them up .	-5.8567
They argue that the transportation of baggage should cost money and pay passengers this service if they wish .	-4.0237
Many of Wall Street ’ s new baggage charges regard as a sign that airlines have enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .	-4.2370
Most , however , so far leave the finger of charges on hand baggage .	-3.9724
Spirit Airlines Inc. made three years ago the first charges for hand baggage and later followed Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-5.0917
The only other airline with such a charge is Hungarian Wizz Air , explained by the airline advisor Jay Sorensen , who is closely following the additional charges .	-4.0459
It estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand-luggage charge Spirit would raise USD 50 million a year .	-3.3756
Sorensen , who was formerly a leader of Midwest Airlines , has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him on the platform if passengers faced with the company ’ s unusual baggage charge .	-7.9704
“ The board process was one of the most versatile I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-2.7837
I expected to see count knits and practical discussions on the platform .	-4.7254
“ The aircraft was full , ” he declared , “ and boarding was like forged . ”	-2.2935
Frontier also follows the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , soft drink or juice .	-3.6376
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or juice would be able to keep the whole can and that coffee would be refilled free .	-5.2582
Water remains free .	-0.9721
US Airways was briefly trying to demand money for soft drinks in 2008 , but it reversed seven months later , after passengers complained and no other large society had complained .	-6.6303
frontiers move to charge on hand baggage when passengers do not purchase directly with the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-5.4250
Airlines pay online travel agents such as Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-3.1299
This will give all companies an incentive to move passengers directly to their destination , rather than via an online travel agency .	-5.7711
Frontier has , however , most advanced in this area .	-3.7174
In September , the company started using an online travel agency only half the number of frequent flyer miles .	-4.3576
On Wednesday , the miles were cut back to 25 % of the route .	-3.0027
One flight with Frontier over 1000 miles for a third party provider will therefore only bring you 250 miles .	-6.3971
Passengers can also book only for direct purchases on the site of Frontier seats .	-5.2114
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but business shrinks and the company loses money .	-4.2869
The revenue fell by 9 % , and the airline capacity fell just under 13 % in the first quarter , as in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-4.8235
Republic has tried to manage Frontex 's finances under the sale of society .	-4.0530
The sayings from the Bible	-2.6005
Well 40 women attended the last breakfast of this year in the Protestant church of Biscingen .	-4.9307
The theme of the day in the municipal house was " sayings from the Bible " and " speeches from the Middle Ages " .	-4.7409
Zia Köhler , the chairman of the church council , went to the biblical saying after breakfast .	-3.7114
" Everyone has said that there are signs of life , rules or warnings , " she said .	-6.5946
You compared several sayings with the relevant Bible and explained the importance .	-3.7005
They called sayings like : wood aurage is vigilant as wading from the eyes , throwing an eye on someone who gives his wife the Lord a sleep , washing his hands of his innocence .	-7.6279
On several occasions , the referees were able to advise their listeners as they were .	-6.3895
The phrases from the Middle Ages were written by the clergy in Christel Dener : All good things are three , blue , something behaved .	-6.1813
It declared the importance and origin of the phrases they called " bridges to the past " .	-4.6381
To finish , a raffle was initiated .	-3.8511
The prices were on a table and were full of humorous steps before being handed over to the winners .	-4.9166
Among the visitors of the breakfast round were also the mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger .	-3.8935
Learn more than unemployed : A pilot project for Unlearned in Tourism	-4.5435
An pilot project for the tourism industry is at the bleachian Lake Constance Council .	-6.1631
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as an unexperienced in the industry will become skilled in hotels and restaurants over three winter .	-5.2197
" The new thing is that the six-month courses with qualifications " , said Carmen Wiechert by the Neubrandenburg employment agency .	-4.0058
The benefits are many : participants would not be unemployed by this , firms would have skilled workers who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-7.3929
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Federation ( Deoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-3.6608
NSA explains that a “ internal error ” and not hacker are blame for the crash of the site .	-4.0179
The shadowy National Security Agency explained at the late Friday that a mistake has paralysed its public site a few hours and not hackers , as claimed online .	-7.0093
“ NA.gov was unable to reach a few hours this night because during a planned update an internal error occurred , ” the spy agency reported in a message sent by email .	-8.5197
The problem will be solved this evening .	-3.7838
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.2722
In the early evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users .	-4.1683
Previously , a spokesman from the NSA said that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ compromised in no way . ”	-3.9166
Secret information is not in danger , the speaker says .	-3.8228
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA web site with a DDoS attack .	-4.3426
With such attacks , the target website will be flooded with page views until the server is overloaded and the site will collapse .	-4.8925
Cybertactical is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system .	-3.8956
The former supersecret NNA , whose nickname was No Search Agency ( not such an authority ) , is now found in the public light and has been exposed to criticism by the recent months of revelations about her extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disenchanted former NNA member Edward Snowden .	-9.6722
The growing controversy surrounding the secret service ’ s implicit initial speculation about the fact that the incident today is the result of a targeted Cyprus peration .	-6.1323
The number of people without jobs fell in October by 22 to 1.7 .	-3.8223
Although the quota of 3.1 % was better than last year and even better than in September , " we would have hoped for more " , says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Director of the Agency for Labour in Sonthofen .	-5.4973
Because many farms have responded so far to attitudes .	-3.8916
According to Felder-Bauer , this is a reason : " We have hardly skilled workers in the craft industry , health care and care of the elderly " .	-6.9759
International seaboard jobs are also available for hotel and catering services since September .	-7.0437
In the middle of December the winter season starts .	-2.2768

Rebenefiting Bombardier from a decline in delivery and procurement	-6.2278
Canada ’ s aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net earnings on Thursday after it had been under pressure by halting orders and deliveries in third quarter aircraft and contract problems in railway engines .	-7.3153
Bombardier , located in Montreal , also published no flight test data for its brand new CSSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the aircraft could go to commercial use next September under the ambitious schedule .	-5.7695
On the maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , only three more starts were followed , making it questionable whether the test phase is planned .	-5.9325
The results remained behind the projections , leading to a price fall of more than eight percent at the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-5.0816
Cameron Doerksen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his assessment of “ outperformer ” on Thursday with a view to having a limited rate potential for the next one to two quarters .	-5.6031
“ Although weaker delivery numbers were anticipated in aircraft to a large extent , we are clearly disappointed with the transport trend , ” said Doerksen in a customer write .	-8.2051
We believe that Bombardier will get new orders for the CSSeries when the aircraft test program is proceeding .	-5.2905
But if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more skeptical of the programme .	-3.5782
Bombardier hopes that the CS series of aircraft can feed the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-4.1843
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and started for the first time in September after months of delays .	-3.3134
But until now , binding orders for the CSSeries with 177 moderate , as potential purchasers are waiting for the results of flight tests and want to see whether the company 's claims about fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new nozzle transport device are true .	-7.5911
There are currently 403 orders and pledges from 15 customers and companies .	-2.7940
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin has confidence that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use .	-4.3643
Moreover , on Thursday , corporate management promised analysts and the media that the programme was in the pipeline .	-6.0438
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the plane ’ s standing time had been planned ground and software updates .	-4.4962
Each manufacturer is planning differently .	-3.1183
We decided to take a first flight and then to involve a period of vocational training , which we did .	-5.3919
This is happening throughout the whole aviation programme .	-2.3296
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the rest were told by company .	-4.6426
Nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical as to whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer can take aircraft of the CSSeries .	-4.6168
Bombardier explained that it is planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update them in the next few months .	-5.5641
“ The slow advance of flight tests – even if they obviously meet bombing of internal planning – reinforces our view that the initial quarter of 2015 will be postponed , ” Dorsen said .	-7.3820
In the third quarter of September , at the end of September , net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share in the year before .	-4.4769
The customized profit per share remains 9 cents .	-2.5125
Sales fell slightly from 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.6535
Analysts expected a $ 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-3.5477
The world 's fourth largest aircraft manufacturer , has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a drop of 57 last year .	-3.7432
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-0.7159
The order book in the aerospace saving sector was $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , and was thus unchanged on December 31 .	-4.8625
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were disappointing in our guidelines , but low order intake and market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.9333
Sales in the aerospace industry fell by 13 % to two billion dollars .	-2.5608
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest rail manufacturer , announced that its sales rose by nearly 11 % to $ 2.1 billion in this section .	-4.7025
The order book in transport saved was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , which was slightly increased from December 31 .	-4.3224
The profit range in the transport sector was affected by settlement problems with some major contracts .	-4.4397
According to corporate management , new benchmarks will be set for the fourth quarter .	-3.3733
On Thursday , after Wednesday ’ s trade , the Bombardier share stood at 8.5 % , with 4,83 Canadian dollars having also been announced that the Google Financial Officer Patrick Pichette will change to the Board .	-7.6930
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world 's third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier 's closest Rivale , signed a 14 % decline in quarterly earnings on Thursday .	-6.0210

Smoke-dependent lawyer who has warned drug boss before police investigation must be incarcerated .	-5.5908
Country House Dietta , 42 , gave further information on the subworld size Neil Scarborough .	-5.0071
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light .	-2.8566
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-2.3119
A well-known criminal defence who has warned a drug barons of a large police investigation because he was afraid to find out his secret drug addiction has been sentenced to three years in prison .	-4.6201
Basharat Dietta , 42 , furnished Underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on its activities in the drug trade , having been compromised by its own coca . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.2330
In 2011 , he was arrested in his house as a “ first-class ” lawyer with the nickname “ Bash ” , after the police sent to Scarborough to a former drug practice .	-8.4868
Staff examined how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was one of the lawyers ’ meals with colleagues .	-6.4990
The investigation revealed that Dietta regularly consumed World class A drugs after the tests of cocaine had been found in his hair , on his wallet and credit cards .	-5.3087
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 he tried to obtain unauthorized information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.8396
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-4.4043
They were arrested later , together with 32 other people , after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth <unk> 1.5 million and <unk> 200,000 in cash with .	-5.4493
Dietta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could be publicised .	-4.5353
Today Dietta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found and sentenced at Liverpool Crown Court after a three week trial in two charges for obstructing justice .	-5.3160
In a previous survey , he gave the cocaine ownership .	-5.2814
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in their inquiries against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone with Dietta in February 2011 .	-4.4049
Two investigation officials followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas House and where the drugs with a purity of 60 % were placed in a black golf hand under the refuse of the lawyer .	-5.2686
Shortly after receiving the drugs , Scarborough regularly served with Dietta , who was at the soccer stadium of Blackburn Rovers in EPark during dinner .	-6.4007
The lawyer returned home , drug and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-4.2080
The court was told that Dietta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after testing Class A drugs had been discovered in his hair , his wallet , and his credit cards .	-5.2679
Dietta was arrested later but denied taking cocaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that her discussion was “ legal secrecy . ”	-5.8536
During his arrest Didetta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were assured and taken out of a hair test .	-4.1891
At the police he said he would call an office and client at home for legal matters , both under his private address and at work .	-5.4195
It was told in court that he had called important drug trafficking players , some of whom had previously been represented , after major arrests and informed what investigators knew about .	-6.8285
According to a lawyer , Anne Biden said : “ A criminal practice should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-6.9326
Dietta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defence , since he has become too committed to certain clients .	-5.1510
The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his lawyer .	-2.8382
A part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the person 's lawyer .	-3.9320
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.4446
He acted as if he could , so that she could continue to pursue her criminal activities .	-5.1476
Mr Didtta has brought his profession into disrepute .	-4.6352
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he managed to compromise his independence .	-3.9313
Dietta dismissed any malfeasance of himself , saying : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , what I was not and wanted to pass information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do it immediately . ”	-6.4116
But after the hearing , Lee Haltead said by the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Dietta has taken the step from a criminal defence to a crime at the moment when he began acquiring drugs from organized criminals . ”	-5.9521
His form of cocaine led to a hopeful compromise and made him vulnerable to the motives of organised crime that instructed him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-6.4946
lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence .	-3.2770
Dietta has abandoned this trust and tried to hide behind the façade of his profession .	-3.8960
The seriousness and organizing Crime Unit of Lancashire initiated an investigation against Dietta , which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and the judiciary , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-7.3713
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that no one can escape the arm of the law .	-3.4242
We will find you and bring you to court .	-2.5369
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after having declared himself guilty of the conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-4.4823
Twenty-five other people involved in the drug trafficking were sentenced to total of 153 years for drug offenses .	-3.8123
On his website Dietta published an area with questions and answers about himself , in which he called his dream job to represent a client on the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-6.2135
Revolutionary work of church music	-2.1266

The so-called German fair with the original title " Gespossible to celebrate the sacred sacrifice of the fair " , D 8722 , is a spiritual work of composer Franz Schubert from the years 1826 and was considered to be almost revolutionary at the time .	-6.7189
The fair will be performed within the framework of the services of the Lord , as the creator of Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-6.3848
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by a brass group of the Frohsense Tennenronn and Noemi Lokodi at the organ .	-5.2808
Haslach : Progresses with increasing confidence .	-5.9035
With the elections to the Ministry of Justice in 2015 , for example , in the hands of the sea , Haslach ( SE ) will fundamentally change .	-5.9295
There is then only one common parish for all six parishes .	-4.2572
At a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühckenbach , Fischbach , Steinach and Welchenstein prepared for changes .	-4.6517
After all , there is nothing to be done about the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish to implement them as satisfactory as possible .	-6.8209
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear : scepticism about the new hesitant , but is increasingly a source of confidence .	-5.5530
From the ideas and expectations of innovation to 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish church , the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main attention of the maritime team were very constructive .	-6.9155
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained , on the basis of a presentation , the new directives on maritime treats in the archdiocese of Freiburg .	-4.8217
Then the SE Haslach is in future a body of public law that comes into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities .	-5.6887
There will only be a joint parish church and a council of foundations in which the priest has power .	-6.2053
Each parish should be represented by at least two elected members , in which the six parish teams are formed on the ground .	-5.3267
Their task will be to promote religious life in the town in the future .	-4.7853
There was a great deal of talk in relation to the budgets of the individual parish .	-5.3749
The latest news shows that accumulated credit is subject to an obligation .	-6.9627
The liabilities go over to the whole community .	-3.7212
There was great concern , particularly with regard to the major planned investments , the obligation of which all the parishes meet .	-7.2115
" In the past , too , only investment was made in projects that could be tackled by the various parishes alone , " relative hasice head of the parish of Bruno Prinzbach .	-7.8859
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes , Barbari Knight , the chairman of the body in the careful clearing of the distillery .	-6.8740
They had made their job in 2006 , ' One will , five will remain ' and had to say that this is not so easy .	-6.9145
The bodies of the Haslacer Seesoriurist were then able to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish church and the practical work of the community teams .	-6.4609

In Pfizer , the electricity sector will become more expensive	-2.3056
The citizens of Pfizer must adapt to increased electricity costs .	-4.5618
As confirmed by the managers of the towns , Jörg-Arne Bias , towards the S<unk>DKURIER , there are 70 to 90 Euro additional costs per year for a four-person Pfloulillo family .	-7.9374
The essential reason for the upcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG shift from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.4342
This turnaround will be determined every year in October by the four operators of the large power road .	-4.8410
These figures are the additional costs incurred by the energy addressing , which they can raise by means of a levy on the electricity price .	-6.0669
The cities of Pfizer are the last link in this chain .	-4.0107
The supervisory board of the energy company was , in its forecasts , even run out of a higher levy , as Jörg-Arne Bias reported .	-5.2266
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before next week the city works could inform its customers about the exact price increase .	-4.9267
" We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , so Bias , where the number will be close to the 2 cents .	-5.0587
Traffic lights on permanent red : Always keep an eye on waiting time .	-6.2623
Sometimes a traffic light is not green .	-2.7561
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-1.8897
What should we do then - at Red ?	-2.9620
If a Betroffener waited long enough for a red light and the crossing is free , he can drive , explains the Stuttgarter Ralf Becker in the magazine " motorcycle " .	-4.2326
But the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.8007
Becker , advised at least five minutes before starting from a malfunction of the traffic light .	-5.1934
However , if the drive continues despite the red light , it must be clear that it bears the full responsibility for an accident caused by it .	-5.8045
Anyone who is allowed less than five minutes may not wait long enough , he warns Becker and points to a decision by the Supreme Court in Hamm .	-6.1806
After about three minutes of continuous red a driver had ignored the traffic light and had to be responsible for a negligent red light .	-5.3164
The traffic light was not broken , but jumped to green little later .	-4.5718
A ban on travelling would save him for the special situation - but not a fine .	-4.6816
Commune is pleased with a solid budget	-3.5143
Whenever the budget is discussed at municipal meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laugh well .	-3.3462
The municipal boom in Herdwanen-Schönach is well filled and debt no longer knows the administration since 2005 .	-5.5896
The 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a full success in this sense .	-2.8786
This became clear when the annual accounts for 2012 .	-3.7208
As Mrs Rothe said , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.4 million is more than EUR 7 million than it was planned .	-5.6484
The surplus of the administrative budget of approximately EUR 1.8 million is also about EUR 1 million over the approach .	-4.9911
The surplus is due primarily to higher commercial tax revenue and to the municipal share of income tax .	-5.2440
The wealth budget , too , was well above what was planned .	-3.8602
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.6278
" This is essentially due to the increased management of the administrative budget , " said Rothmund .	-5.5332
Since less investment has been made in the 2012 financial year than it has been planned , the return method has also been higher .	-6.3683
In total , the general debt could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million now .	-4.4067
The Mayor Ralph Gerster was looking for the good work with Rothmund and her team .	-6.9702
" So a work is not just thrown out of the sleeves " , commended Gerster with a view to the annual accounts .	-5.4732
He and the local council enjoyed the good figures .	-4.2337
It may sound paradoxical , but these good figures could soon be expensive for citizens .	-3.3752
The good financial position enabled the commune to renounce high Hebei rates in the past .	-4.5142
But according to the most cogent , subsidies have already been cut from the country .	-4.8796
There are preconditions for these grants from various compensatory premiums .	-4.3609
Among other things , the cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain sets of arrests .	-5.4762
" We have to look at the issue of lifting rates because , in the coming years , we have to invest for which we would like to have grants " , Gerster announced in this context .	-6.1877

In the case of the visit of the cafés of the same name at the Opstrike district of Kleve in sight of the University of Rhine-Waal , it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-12.4457

UN proclaims new goals in the fight against poverty	-3.4475
The United Nations is starting from now on to draw up a number of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals proclaimed twelve years ago to combat poverty .	-4.5036

However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.8010

Although the third party reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet taken any trees , Malmon is in advance warning the pointing . the .	-10.7714
Many players have trained me in the A-youth .	-4.4721

Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-2.5385
Thousands of people assembled at the centre of Mapcredit under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and the first President of Mozambique to vote in favour of peace in a rare public demonstration .	-4.9538
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , the managing director of an investment company .	-2.1083
For fear of the future of the country , she has entered her business clothes against a T-shirt with the labeling “ We are asking for security ” to Portuguese and joined the crowd on the capital ’ s independence Thursday .	-8.8168
For two weeks , there have been reports almost daily about mergers of government forces and Renaus , which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-4.9116
Renaamo was a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White regime of Rhodesia and later South Africa ’ s apartheid government , seeking to destabilise the country ’ s independent government .	-5.0392
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.2440
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict , but recent events have caused foreign investors and local residents .	-4.5182
The fast growing economy is at stake because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal bearings in the northwest could generate more than $ 50 billion in companies like Rio Tinto , Vale of Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anarko from the US in the next few years .	-7.0831
The ruling Frelimo-Party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renaus are blaming each other for tensions .	-4.2691
Renamo claimed that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of sofa la , a traditional stronghold , on 17 October .	-4.7279
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated , when government forces attacked Renamoo bases and tried to kill Afono Dhalakma , the group ’ s leader , Renat.com ’ s spokesman against the Financial Times .	-6.3295
The government gives Renaamo the blame for the merger and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers .	-3.9788
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.1884
On Wednesday , with AFP , the French news agency , he said that Döhlakma sees itself as a “ losers ” who “ wants to use all his remaining powers to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-5.9705
Both Frey and Renamo emphasise that they want to avoid war .	-3.9283
But anxiety has increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words that Renamo is in 1992 .	-5.1990
Against the FT , he said that he meant that Freymo no longer respected the agreement .	-3.5589
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations , ” said Mazanga .	-2.2583
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of confrontations this year .	-3.5515
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dzhlakma ) who meet the heads together , ” says Joseph Hanlon , a teacher at the Open University and Mozambique ’ s expert .	-3.8309
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is willing to make the necessary concessions .	-2.9223
Renamo , who pressed for electoral reforms , has already declared that she will boycott local elections in November .	-3.6414
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-2.0301
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt to achieve concessions and financial concessions from the government .	-2.7348
Renat.Elections have been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party founded by a former Renamo Member will probably improve the election process .	-6.9528
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due to finish next year ’ s second term – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-4.0273
“ He does not want multiparty democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” said Mazanga .	-3.0800
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has done worrying attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection .	-3.6563
Most of the battles took place in the province of Macalla , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale are used to export coal .	-7.5878
In June , Rio broke off for a month after Renaus announced an attack on the track .	-4.6139
Mazanga asked whether Renaus will repeat this threat .	-3.7641
Renamo wanted “ to warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-3.0661
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , Head of Medialoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent escape wave .	-4.3372
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.1381
Omar Sultanahmet , a pioneer , said that people simply wanted stability .	-3.0306
“ Don ’ t care Renaamo and Fresmo , they simply want peace and usable roads ” , he explained .	-4.6291
Children should be taught myths and myths as “ for life ” , meaning an author .	-3.9009
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force does not have an opportunity to beat clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend show how important it is to have a dream .	-4.7288
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too deadly , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” so Crossley Holland ’ s “ careful choice ” of age-related works .	-6.4708
“ I ’ m amazed that American myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-2.0744
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.3647
He added that , among authors and teachers who are “ overly didactic , ” children would “ turn away ” completely , because entertaining stories would convey the messages “ underground . ”	-6.2941
Crossley Holland , which translated Beowulf from the fishing Saxon language and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norre Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can follow certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-8.0171
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to give hope .	-3.7417
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil .	-2.1203
This must be underpointed , and history must be revealed and not declared .	-5.4625
This is the old story of the show rather than telling .	-2.6338

A federal court in the US blocked the order of a judge on Thursday asking for changes to the stop-and-hair-program ( “ Keep and Search ” ) of the New York Police Department , and removed judges from the case .	-6.5104
The 2nd US court explained that rulings by Judge Shira Blatter would be suspended until a city was decided .	-6.2846

The Court of Appeal heard the arguments for a call for suspension on Tuesday .	-3.5973
The appeal report explained that the judges had to be removed from the case , because they violated the code of conduct for US judges by specifying that a judge should avoid the appearance of party opinion ; this was partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which they publicly responded to the Court ’ s criticism .	-7.0623
The judges had alleged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they target black and Latin American men with the stop-and-hair program in an unmeasured manner .	-7.1139
They appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes , including reforms to directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot program with camera based on the body in areas where most controls were carried out .	-6.2667

Advocates of NYPD ’ s stop-and-hairdy-programme will say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way in which other police Presidency uses the rule .	-7.4695
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the police ’ s morale , but not crime ; they would also wasted money and not solve the broader problem of a police force that , after the disappearance of thousands of posts in the last decade , is under pressure .	-7.3134
The judge pointed out that it did not end the stop-go hairy practice , which is constitutional , but only the way in which the Robert PD controls are implemented .	-6.5527

What about the first ?	-1.7398
Does he know about the telephone hack ?	-1.7096
He challenged that , but we say , “ And whether he knew . ”	-3.9653
rumors about an affair of Clarkes were first taken up by the design editors of emergencies , when a source that was sexually interested in Pamwrby was said : “ Don 't waste your time , she is with Charles . ”	-6.8414

China : No absolute protection possible	-3.0824
" We want to include the inhabitants early in planning , " former mayor Jens Häßler opened the civil information event for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-4.7807
Around 80 participants had entered the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , to ask questions , to express concerns and to introduce ideas .	-5.5646
Someone said : ' The ultimate decisions made by the municipal council members ' .	-4.2462
Floods , which hit the Gechingen on May 15 , 2009 , had been a profound event that raised the question of protection measures for the future .	-11.0245
A river basin examination was commissioned by the neighbouring village of Abdullah , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-5.0294
" The protection of as many branch plots as possible is the goal " , so many chiefs .	-7.1009

However , it was pointed out that there was only support when an overall concept is implemented .	-5.1754
To this end , the community should depend on the participation of citizens .	-4.3056
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.6716
In the best case , the implementation could begin in 2016 .	-2.5266

Gregor Kühn , the engineer responsible for the office of forest and Corbe from hills that proposed the concept , stressed that it requires the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired aim in the sum .	-8.2713
You should also find the most economical solution , just as Joachim Forest and Corbe .	-5.6246
The reaction was similar to those of the old town , which , even with normal rain , have always suffered from overflying the channel network .	-9.1505
The problem is well known for administration and first action has already been taken .	-3.5886
However , it was pointed out that the guidelines on sewer systems are different from those for flood protection , and this should not be confused .	-7.3053
The municipality should be obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of regenerative processes could become increasingly resistant .	-4.7904

Dick had had the chance to read his late books like a mixture of the revelation of John and a computer manual .	-3.3552
Perhaps he was crazy enough to put drugs on his brain .	-2.1442
He died early already that the machines are dividend units .	-4.7373

They accept that worst is happening and prevent the criminal thought being put into effect .	-4.1951

The barrel turned out the revelation that German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was orphaned , possibly for ten years .	-4.2138

The testimonies of the Sheriff of Lower County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but that reflected the family of the 17-year-olds .	-4.5653
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , versus FoxNews.com.	-3.2866
They never believed that he had died as the sheriff unfolded .	-5.5860
“ They believe that there is no logic , against the laws of physics and common sense , ” Crump .	-4.0865
Instead , they are convinced that the truth is covered up to protect the person or the person responsible for the death of their son .	-3.2293
“ Your son went to school and came back in the glue bag , ” he commented .	-2.8118
On Thursday , US prosecutor Michael Moore said that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johns , as a number of important issues have been left unresolved .	-7.4119
What was the cause of death ?	-0.5862
Is his death attributable to a crime ?	-1.5911
That said Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.5797
I follow the facts in which direction they lead .	-3.9222
My goal is to find out the truth .	-1.3255
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.4933
Moore explained to reporters who initially made the point that Johnson died on the consequences of a “ position position . ”	-6.4899
But a second car has created another cause of death , such as Moore .	-3.9331

CDC publication of allergies in schools	-3.5995
On Wednesday , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a number of guidelines for treating children with food allergies in schools .	-3.4362
These are the first such directives that the US government has issued , as the number of children subject to education increases with food allergies .	-3.7224
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergies .	-2.2863
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children rose by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-3.3775
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies and how to treat children , which show allergic reactions .	-4.1290
It is also recommended that schools that epinephrin should have priority – the auto-injection of the brand epilepsy is most used – in order to respond to a potentially deadly overfeeling response .	-6.9989
The state ’ s legislators have recently changed the rules , so that schools Epiphrin can easily be considered .	-6.3641

Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with non-clear genital mutilation .	-2.9647
newborns will no longer be male or female .	-4.0930
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare a sex for such children , but can provide “ impracted ” or “ not defined ” on the certificate of birth .	-7.4367
The aim of the law is to exert pressure on parents so that they do not have to make overhasty decisions regarding sexual allocation operations for infants , and to combat discrimination against sexual people .	-7.6277
An intersexual person , according to the BBC , later said : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.5843
I maintain the Flickr work created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .	-4.1450
An estimated one of 2 000 children each year does not come as a boy or as a girl to the world .	-4.9536
They belong to the intersexual group , a group falling under the diagnosis of sex differentiation disorder ( DSD ) , a collective concept for people with atypical chromosomes , testicular glands ( eggs or pants ) or unusually developed genital mutilation .	-6.6477
Wallis Simpson was perhaps intersexually .	-2.6773
The understanding of the gender identity is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise that the best available sexual allocation information should be used , if it is not possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding – if ever – for an operation .	-6.1593
The New Yorker psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said the new German law “ lean on a good cause ” .	-4.6130
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.2228
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not ” he said .	-3.5943
You can make a sexual allocation without surgery and then wait for the identity developer .	-5.4216
The scientific data on how a child develops his gender identity at all are not very accurate .	-3.0538
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.7279
It is like the secret , which is why people are homophobic .	-3.4803
In a report to the European Commission in 2011 , it is said that sexual people are different from transsexual or transgender-persons , because their status is not gender , but from their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically both simultaneously or clearly defined as one of them .	-6.6262
These properties have been identified in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , posture , breasts and statutes , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital mutilation or in chrome-related structures and hormones .	-5.8748
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by inter-sexual and transgender people in the workplace , and the extent of harassment , violence and preliminary criticism .	-6.0791
Not boys matching gender have a special camp now .	-3.5060
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to be male , female , or “ third ” on official documents .	-4.4946

In neighboring France , sexual themes are still controversial , so a news coverage on France 24 .	-5.0517
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from textbooks .	-4.7907
The American website Catholic Online also resisted the German law , on the grounds that “ If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we are tording two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-7.0039
The mother of a newborn from Maryland said to Baby Zone , she would be better if babies were to be allocated a sex at birth .	-4.5217
“ The parent ’ s baby is already stressful enough , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your own child , ” she told the parent ’ s website .	-5.6267
Children need stability and security .	-0.5550
Historically , children born with both male and female sex were referred to as Hermapine returns , according to the attractive Greek God , which had both sexes .	-5.6890
Even ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something to be eliminated and then rebuilt .	-4.4376
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , after it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when they grow up with the sex they assign .	-6.5276
“ In the middle of the 20th century , this was called a “ psychiatric emergency , ” he said Drescher .	-4.4098
When such a child was born , not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-2.9238
The ruling theory on the treatment of children with non-clear genital genital mutilation refers to Dr John Money from the Johns Hopkins University , who believed that the sex was the form .	-6.9883
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” and argued , social and environmental impulses – such as parents train a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , and whether a person looks as male or female .	-4.7031
But , in a case known as “ John / Joan ” in 1966 , his theories were controversial .	-2.7533
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off on a pledge , to freeze the child completely , and also remove his pants and bring it to life as a girl .	-8.2994
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion that he was not ” , says Drescher .	-3.5197
When the boy was 15 , he moved back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.3902
But he committed suicide with 38 .	-2.4934
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.9238
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations entered the public , who are “ unhappy with the result . ”	-4.6409
For example with Jim Bruce , a 36 year old author from Montana , who was born with Y-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-3.5835
Doctors were not clear about whether he had a big opptory or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a more satisfying life than man .	-5.5142
So his external organ and the Hooden were removed shortly after the birth of 1976 surgery and was raised as a girl .	-4.8243
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.5806
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com .	-1.7140
I was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.4720
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginoplasty .	-1.9773
But , as he was depressed , and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical act .	-4.2611
What he found out was shocking .	-0.9855
I was sterilised at my birth – and nobody ever said so .	-2.6983
Bruce was born with a DSD , where his body could not produce enough testosterone to the development of genitals .	-3.6258
After experiencing the truth , he changed to male identity , received Testosteron-injection and left his breasts removed .	-5.8355
The operation has made it infertile .	-2.1080
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for the notion of being perceived as normal .	-4.5333
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , the California legal group Advocates for Informed Choice , ensures that the German law can “ slide down and encourage stigmata . ” , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.4018
“ Many activists are concerned that Germany ’ s decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to grant the child “ not ” , explained .	-6.2692
We fear that this will benefit from intervention .	-2.9989
We think it would be better to allocate male or female sex and then wait .	-2.2039
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.4063
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports the Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize the third gender . ”	-4.5628
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she said .	-3.2209
The German law concerns the allocation at birth .	-1.5898
This is not a battle to force small children at this stage .	-2.8064
If they grow up , they can choose their own body .	-3.4315
But Dr Arlene Baratz , a breast radiologist from the Kinderburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-assistance group , says the German law “ Authorized ” both parents and children .	-6.6926
Katie , the daughter of Riatz , was born with male chromosomes but has a DSD called complete androgenresistance .	-4.0998
As a result of the recision of the target cells for Testosteron , Cate developed female characteristics .	-4.9221
She has a vaginas , but not an Utersus and no egg batons .	-3.9631
Today Katie 29 is married and is working on the University of Pennsylvania as a member of the Psychiatry family .	-5.3108
Although it is fruitful , it hopes to be able to receive a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-4.2200
“ The law gives parents space , which means they don ’ t have to make decisions prematurely , ” said Bardrate .	-5.7563
It gives them the time to make different tests and to clarify things and gives them time to write them “ male ” or “ female ” .	-3.7950
In this way , everything is fine – you prefer the child big and loves it .	-4.3847
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the parental leave .	-3.4535
And we do not need to undertake too hastily an operation that cannot be reversed .	-3.8562
“ That concludes the children ’ s decision , ” explaining the fear that parents are afraid of being driven away because they think they are not doing the right thing . ”	-8.7989
Ultimately , the child decides about the sex that suits him better – and that is wonderful .	-3.7099
This will enable children to make their choice .	-3.4039
Unknew girls by shot out of car	-4.3802
Unaware were injured in a 12-year-old mansion in Sachsen-Anhalt on cars from a car .	-5.9992
The perpetrators were probably fired on a group of children on Thursday evening in gene for an air pressure weapon .	-5.0830
The police organized the castle .	-3.9566
The girl was slightly wounded from the left Wade .	-2.4037
Vaccinating the girl into hospital .	-3.4045
The shot came from a mini car that was passing by a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-4.2298
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.6970
The perpetrators also checked a bus stop .	-2.6657
A disc crashed .	-2.3456
They then went on .	-2.1703
The criminal police identified it on Friday .	-4.2092
Until now , the Police Inspectorate of Kempten can look back on a calm Hallowaan night .	-5.6801
The officials have only been invited to play twice in front of the children raising them against house façades .	-6.2588
Since house owners realized this in good time and removed the egg remains , no material damage should be incurred .	-5.4326
There was no material damage to the surrounding area .	-8.3280
A local visitor at the Bischoff ’ s friend ’ s path reported that his cars were wrapped up with Klodocument and that his bike stunts .	-9.5507
However , until the police arrive , the man has found his tricks in the immediate vicinity of everyone , so the police did not have to take any further action .	-8.0840
Living with an angle	-3.5749
It 's a great place to stay .	-6.1609
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree population , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-4.0630
It is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-3.3215
" I hope you have no fear of spines ? " , asks Waltraud Ries and points to a major spider in the front frame .	-6.4722
I have been looking for a new home for my husband and myself for some time now .	-2.4244
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-1.7365
The reason , however , is not a spincry , but a worry that at the age the many stairs can no longer be overcome to the house and in the apartment , explains .	-7.8757
In addition , since a menisus operation , the interviewer has had to be found on his own body , which means moving to the floor with a handicap .	-7.4198
Only recently is a book published by her on the topic of happiness at the age - Which form is the best for me ? ' .	-5.6976
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at all at age ' , it begins to tell .	-5.8060
When she moved to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-3.9600
Today , in the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries regards it .	-4.3730
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who are concerned with the topic of ' living at age ' .	-4.9890
Most of them aside as long as they are .	-3.5797
Alt will always be only the other ' , says she is pretty .	-5.6976
Only when the strain of suffering is really great is thought .	-4.1407
'Then it may also be too late ' , so Ries .	-3.1805
In its book the interior architect presents 17 living models for a certain home at age .	-4.9509
'Which type of housing you choose is always an individual decision ' , explains it .	-3.4181
D i e solution do not exist for age .	-2.4446
Even those who can afford the old age in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they could also be sick .	-4.9005
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the national language , you can also join in Dolce Vita , ' you agree to accept the technical accounting authorisation in the settlement .	-8.4793
Among their models are classical care models , alternative forms of housing , or the often quoted familiy-WG .	-5.4697
At the age each has his or her spreads and macs .	-4.8021
'For me , however , such a living community would be nothing ' , she says with a master eye .	-6.3959
Not even like a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-3.2904
' At the age you just need to have its back rooms ' , so Ries .	-6.4490
However , the author does not want to rule out the existence of a senior community .	-4.6108
But that should be different from the classic student WG .	-4.7885
And sometimes you just want his calm , believe it .	-2.9955
This is not the only country in which it is .	-5.3894
" Most of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for so long , " is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil services at the age of the capital .	-5.6892
Your department advises people about the topic of elderly .	-4.4685
That is why elderly people would often be able to take advantage of the opportunities and restrictions that are often denied , just to be able to stay in their familiar environment , and that is also the experience of the Foundation of Trade .	-10.7867
Today there are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible to all guests .	-4.4925
It is recommended to all those concerned with the age-just conversion of their house or apartment to be thoroughly informed and not to hire the best craftsmen .	-7.5654
Today , there are also projects for the age-free reconstruction specialists .	-6.0246
Even in the rental apartment there is one or the other , and if it is only a toilet lift , the interior architect clarifies .	-6.2203
But not always the existing flat can be redesigned in terms of age and hence barrier-free , even if it is still so beautiful .	-5.5507
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-4.2140
Although inside the apartment , one could install a stairs lift , which would also be paved with stairs to the apartment door , this would be far more difficult .	-8.5025
She will continue to search until she found the ideal object for himself and her man .	-3.2937
Before moving , it is more suited to your home than before the spider .	-4.6998
The US wants to prosecute Snow-.	-2.8973
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officials Edward Snowden .	-2.7020
He is still accused of having passed away secret information .	-4.5819
So he had to face a trial in the US , said the Secretary of State , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-5.9085
The latest statements made by Snowden would not change this either .	-4.4219
Prior to that , after a meeting with Snow in Moscow , Germany ’ s green politicians Hans-Christian Strbel appealed to the US not to threaten him further with punishment .	-5.6228
Psaki stressed that what we hear is a parliament rather than a German government member .	-6.5996
Intelligence revealed Edward Snowden is generally ready to talk to German authorities .	-4.3536
First of all , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.9909
This was made clear by the former NSG personnel who were looking for in a non-addressed letter sent to the Green Minister Hans-Christian Ströev on Friday after a meeting with Snow-published and Federal Government , Bundestag and Attorney General .	-9.2580
The letter has the following text :	-3.4899
To those in power	-4.0721
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass monitoring .	-2.9774
I was named Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously a contracted and directly employed by the United States as a technical expert on the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .	-4.9902
As a result of my employment in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the laws of my government , which led me to act as a moral duty .	-4.7403
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I witnessed a serious and persistent midgrid , which forced me to leave my family and my home .	-3.7278
I live in exile at the present time and in a nice temporary form of asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-6.2696
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-1.8427
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of comprehensive surveillance that nobody can answer as a service to the public .	-4.7256
These spy revelations had many proposals on new laws and policies aimed at what was known as covert abuse of public trust .	-4.7402
The benefits for society from these gains are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks that have been acquired have clearly been reduced .	-5.1903
Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven positive , my government is still treating dissent as a good faith , seeking to criminalise political expression and to file it .	-6.5219
Still , the truth is not a crime .	-2.1787
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will dismiss this intolerable stance .	-3.7569
I hope that , if the difficulties faced by this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to take appropriate and consistent action in relation to the good awareness of the facts in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-7.3984
I look forward to a conversation with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that is protected by us all .	-5.4908
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Strhel	-3.6449
Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-1.2630
" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.5860
The former nursery in the garden street has sold the parish to a private person .	-3.3929
The Municipal Council agreed to this sales at its recent meeting in the non-public sphere .	-5.2046
The building moved its owner to a " reasonable " price .	-2.1750
" The municipality is satisfied " , stresses Maier .	-2.4730
The budget was EUR 100 000 .	-1.5440
Not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former nursery .	-3.7928
The Mayor is right that Winter will have passed responsibility for the building to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer have to pay for the service of the house , how to heat up , look to the garden and relax the walking path .	-8.1941

Report : Obama ’ s campaign considered to replace Biden by Hillary Clinton .	-3.2822
President Barack Obama ’ s closest adviser in secret thought to replace Vice President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton , the New York Times .	-5.5897
The revelation is the most noteworthy surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-3.8413
The Times has been a copy of the upcoming book , and she reported on Thursday evening that the top counsel of the president had “ major group meetings and the end of 2011 ” to find out whether there is better looking for Obama ’ s lost hope for re-election when he leaves Biden .	-7.9708
According to Jonathan Martin , the national correspondent in the Times , the book follows the story of the efforts of leading officials of the campaign and the White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley to measure the effect of calculating former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-President .	-6.6061
The potential change was a strictly confidential secret in the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and in the Oval Office .	-3.7906
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , the former Obama campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former chief adviser of the White House , David Axelrod , and David Ploufe – knew about the expected change .	-5.0522
In “ Double Down , ” it is claimed that Daley was at the top of the effort to exchange Biden , despite its “ close , personal relationship , ” before deciding against such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-6.8810
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government had actually thought of replacing Biden with Clinton .	-3.2531
" I said a whole series of things to be considered , and that was one of them , " Dalley explained to the magazine .	-3.3311
We must remember that the President had fearsome poll values then , so we thought : “ To God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-6.4739
While Daley described the studies as “ care provided ” , Martin said to Anderson Cooper from CNN that considerable effort had been made during the campaign for re-election to find out whether such a train would go out with regard to the polls .	-7.4547
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you do not think seriously about something , ” Martin said on AC360 .	-4.5323
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about exchange .	-2.4212
Also , he told CNN that he asked Daley whether his boss knew about the potential change .	-6.3108
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff claimed that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew .	-4.1185
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political sonflight Obama ’ s desk had reached .	-4.4343
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thinks Obama was not aware of the studies about whether or not to let Bidie fall in the elections .	-7.0174
“ Available ” , Martin responded .	-2.8034
What is going on with my e-mail ?	-6.7476
In fact , e-mail means electronic letters .	-4.9158
Was the design of the internet service similar to the technical confidentiality of correspondence in conventional mail ?	-5.5825
When designing early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-3.0812
As a result , the basic technical protocols were not designed to create a stable basis for a relayed exchange of letters .	-6.0863
Therefore , conventional mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-4.4806
If you send a mail to ' Anna ' to ' Beni ' , then the computers of the two are directly connected ?	-4.8159
The e-mail program or the Anna browser will send the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step .	-3.4298
If , for example , it has a GMmail account , the Google would be .	-3.2653
This mail server sends the contents to the provider who uses Beni .	-2.3066
You can run the mail over a number of other servers on the internet .	-3.9102
Bennie can then call the content by his provider .	-4.0699
Will traditional email be read on their way through the network ?	-4.3072
Most mails are read by software robots on the way .	-2.6725
At the provider of the sender it is usually checked if the mail performs a damaging program as an attachment .	-5.1875
A virus-check is also carried out on the recipient systems .	-3.8067
In addition , the provider checks whether it is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is either cancelled or dropped into a spam folder at least .	-7.1184
Are the robots yet another task ?	-2.5382
For systems like GMmail , the robots also determine the information Google needs to place in context advertising .	-8.5373
If Anna and Benni communicate via e-mail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google can hide links to holiday offers .	-7.2348
Do people also read e-mails with unknown people ?	-4.1241
The probability of unauthorized persons reading a mail is extremely low .	-2.4719
In theory , however , this is possible .	-1.5847
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.3132
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails .	-3.8142
In addition , possible illegal action is made .	-5.4089
Is it possible to protect e-mails against the Mitread ?	-3.5457
A encryption based on the OpenPGP standard can be effectively encrypted against co-ownership .	-5.2765
With a high technical effort it is also possible to disguise the metadata of email communication , so that it cannot even be recognized who has communicated with whom .	-5.6715
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-1.4108
In the primarily used post boxes , Yahoo and Google play only a minor role in August 2013 , according to a survey of Consivios Consulting .	-5.8200
While the shares of Yahoo Mail last fell , Google 's GMmail could clearly reveal .	-4.2874
Mother in the forest will retire and receive pension .	-4.2057
His mother died , and a man from Wolfsburg got a plan .	-4.1228
He saw the deaths in a forest and continued to collect their pension and carers .	-4.6321
In order to be able to collect further pension and care fees , a 67-year-old Wolfesburger buried his dead mother after an investigation by the police in the forest .	-7.8031
At first he covered up the death of the 89-year-old , then he abandoned the money for more than a year and a half .	-4.9777
Now , as a speaker said on Friday , the 67-year-old must answer for fraud .	-3.8640
So the man hid the woman in a forest near the Helmstedt .	-3.4139
The man was suspect already in May : that there was no need for medicines to be provided to the mother in need of care .	-5.8362
The investigators told pensioners that their mother was travelling to Spain .	-3.0225
Because the officials found this strange , they were further identified .	-4.6530
It came out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that he had last cared for it .	-6.3881
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.7289
Obproduction by the police showed no evidence of a capital crime .	-4.3765
Do you want ice cream that is light in the dark ?	-3.4707
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the dark , using quality .	-2.8877
Charlie Francis used the oceanic properties of the sea and created a shining mess .	-4.3233
The idea came to him after he had read a paper on quality , and was able to convince Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein .	-5.3849
The ice cream reacts when consumed with the tongue , thus increasing the pH value in protein and causing the light .	-5.0225
Chris explains that the eating ice reacted to the warmth in the mouth and light – the more you leak , the lighter it becomes .	-5.3161
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Gift ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , so one gets two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-4.2300
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.8140
When the mouth warms protein , the pH value increases and the ice light .	-4.4278
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed to us ideal to put it to Halloween on the market because it has this wonderful light effect .	-5.5817
It is probably the expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the quality lamp is four times more expensive than gold .	-2.9182
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.5116
But it tastes delicious .	-3.1532
Charming experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , such as beer , cheese , beef and gold leaf .	-3.3350
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .	-3.5810
He says : “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-1.5497
This is in itself impossible because of the heat caused by the icetelling , from which ice cream exists ; but I suspect we find a way to create it .	-6.6650
The ice cream uses the fluorescence properties of a quality that is artificially manufactured by Chinese scientists .	-2.0379
After six days of play , TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League .	-4.4181
It is anticipated for Ingo Ehlers ' team tomorrow at the Derby against TSV Daven , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-5.2455
With this game the season starts again for us .	-2.4863
" I hope that we have finally cleared our head " , Ehlers are optimistic .	-4.3513
He has finally made use of his complete bastard , except for the prolonged use of Hendrix Blohme .	-7.7728
We also use Daemon as we play on Temposgame .	-5.3112
Therefore , we have to keep our error rate low .	-3.3313
But above all , it is important to increase the level that has ultimately left everything but a safe impression .	-5.7973
More casual is Dagunten Coach Thomas Panitz after the first season victory against the North horn .	-5.0484
The game was of course a number .	-2.5156
But we are not the favourite for a long time , because everything can always happen in Derby .	-4.4736
However , Paneliz now wants to put it in Morsum to start a series .	-4.7300
Lack becomes Jan-Malte Jodat .	-3.7923
For this reason the A-young Joost Windrunner , who is active with double matches at the A-Jugendlogist HC Bremen , is his season debut .	-8.6049
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.9179
Halloween 2013 : In figures	-1.0502
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.5568
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , late and miss us for the neighbourhood .	-3.6932
Today I grew to Halloween-Muel .	-4.0696
In the last two years , I have not agreed to divide myself from my apartment from different things , and I think it will not do this year either .	-7.4041
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep when it comes to Halloween .	-2.7029
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , giving a total of $ 6.9 billion to sweets , costumes and decoration , so the US Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-5.2046
One thing I am looking forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-3.0568
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , such as the NRF .	-3.7235
In this year 's exciting unused objects are the last cry .	-4.9746
Women no longer need to lay their clothes in sexy clothes , and they can now also embody tempting food such as pizza , hamburgers or Carolines .	-6.3066
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of Zombies thanks The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk-Space forces will create it this year into the Instant Bots .	-5.5800
According to Google , the most sought zombies , batman , pirate and Warlock costumes are the most popular costumes .	-4.1281
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.3001
We loved our dogs last year and were thus not alone to my surprise .	-4.1381
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for their pets , such as the NRF .	-2.8426
These are a lot of “ Hot Dogs ” .	-3.1554
As far as ambiguity is concerned , we are not bitter .	-4.0353
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , the Niels Company .	-2.2522
These are about 270 million kilograms of Schocorunlock , Luttwans , bonbons and rubber bears .	-5.7548
So good news for the US Treasury , according to the US Department of Commerce , has 41 million people who , with the slogan of “ sweetes or Saures ” .	-5.8069
In fact , we are going to buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – do not mind – eat .	-4.2578
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold by Halloween , the National Association of confectionery manufacturers .	-3.4029
These are about nine billion maize grains .	-2.2350
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.7138
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than to houses where it makes haste .	-3.7077
They have great names like “ terror disabled the Wall ” ( what is actually in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-4.5209
There are actually 1,200 officially recognized spluthhouses in the United States , who will make $ 500 million , so America Howts , and this includes the beautiful photos on which you just go into the pants and then put friends on Facebook , where you will not go again , and one of the type you 'll find will leave a comment like " style-expression " .	-11.1966
But we finally come to the pumpkin .	-3.1291
Charlie Brown became familiar with the great figure when we were children , and the story of a puffy is like the Christmas tree ’ s muddle – something we made from small .	-6.7762
Fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so that most of us have grown up with it , carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-4.4996
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , the US Census Bureau .	-3.1746
The pumpkin version , which slowly dates back to early October , is probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin have been harvested this year .	-8.7640
If you want to know correctly , then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and rent some of their 921 kg heavy pumpkin styles .	-6.1510
Flat fire in Helmets : Liquids made of iron .	-5.0521
The fire brigade had to crash in Helmets on the late Thursday evening .	-4.1461
A three-family house in the county courtyard begins fire at night .	-3.4277
The rescue forces are armed with a blue shield from the house .	-5.3385
In the event of a fire in Helmldering , the rescue forces found a young glue in a three-family house .	-6.7975
Whether it was a person who acted , it was unclear how a police spokesman said in Bavaria .	-6.3022
At the late Thursday evening it had burned it on the ground floor of the house .	-3.2280
When the fire brigade met , the flames were beat from a window .	-3.3511
The staff went into the apartment and found the glue in a room .	-3.6294
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.4992
The ground floor has been damaged .	-1.1765
All the other residents were not at home during the fire , the police speaker said .	-4.4268
For the time being , the building is no longer habitable .	-4.1303
The precise cause of fire was not clear at first .	-2.7581
Germany ’ s largest national church has launched a more offensive to promote the profession of pastors .	-3.3176
As a result , there is a possible parish : The Evangelical Church Hannover expects that the number of its present will be halved by 2030 .	-9.0497
For young people from today , the profession is very attractive and offers a good future , said Pastor Mathis Burfin ( 43 ) in conversation with the Protestant press service .	-5.0323
It is attractive to be able to determine the workflow and the day .	-3.9696
Burfin has commissioned the National Church for the first time a pastor to inspire young people for the meditation school .	-5.3291
At present fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology .	-3.4152
Burfin puts this back to the process of entropy : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-4.6044
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-1.7350
I am Mr modernisation of my deadline and can focus my priorities where it is important to me .	-5.5218
Pastor could be very close to the people as a horseman .	-3.4153
They deserve as much as teachers and could live well from that .	-2.8156
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.5327
This comes up against the young people of today who are not just about careers , but about a sensible job .	-6.7266
According to the National Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Silesia , some 60 pastors are currently in retirement each year .	-4.6684
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a seminary begin their junior training .	-4.0064
In sparsely populated areas such as the resin , the Emzerland or the Wendland in the future it could be difficult to fill jobs .	-4.9441
Burfin wants to organise school days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-4.9086
The Theology school offers a wide range of education .	-5.2593
The President of the Federal Republic can even be President of the Council .	-5.2613
Land Rover Rally Series announced .	-1.4199
In the interior there are racing seats and Six Point belts as well as a safety belt .	-5.3399
The options range from increased brakes , a service package with the support of Bowler practitioners and logistical support to vehicle entering between events .	-4.3730
Drew Bowler , CEO of Bowler Motorsport , said : “ The rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.5643
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as a world-class event .	-4.7500
We are pleased to be able to open this way into partnership with Land Rover and MA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in Great Britain and abroad and prepare new entrants for the hardship and reality of Rally Raid .	-5.5875
We really enjoyed working on the Defense of the Challenge Car – that will be an entertaining competitor .	-6.1964
There is also a training and test day at the Challenge Defenders Defense Day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-4.7331
A fire brigade designed to rescue a female who , 15 metres above the ground , stuck on a dangerous rocky edge in a quarry .	-6.8297
Cockerpanic girls in Ruby ran away after a minor traffic accident .	-4.3051
Three days later , it was discovered by a walkers of quarry in their unfortunate situation .	-3.2234
Fire fighters resisted a wall wall and rescued the dog before a safe death .	-5.4134
The fire brigade was able to secure a bitch who was riding on a 15 meter lead in a rock face .	-6.3949
The nine months old Cockerpanic cancer in Ruby went away on a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days only before it was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.6827
Scott Pädes , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to get back to Ruby and thank the fire fighters of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-6.9998
They had been desperately searching for their missing bitch and published calls for help in social networks when they had run out of the small traffic accidents in the quarry .	-6.3389
About 14 : 15 p.m. on Wednesday , a walkers watching his dog , breaking Ruby at 15 metres high in stone .	-7.7010
The technical rescue team of the Clementin Fire Station rushed to the spot and resisted the rescue of Rubys , which was then transported to the top of a dog box .	-7.6415
Andy Clayton , the specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.7097
It was located in the middle of the cliff wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .	-4.4726
It did not move muscle during its rescue – it was like frozen .	-2.5286
But now it is doing well .	-2.4189
She then got a few dogballs .	-4.1469
That was quite an unusual exercise .	-3.6052
The fact that the dog was discovered is unbelievable .	-1.9189
Peter Lau , the specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge fortune . ”	-2.3930
There was the possibility that she was very badly injured or worse .	-3.4609
Ruby was brought to the veterinary examination but found nothing apart from depletion and depletion .	-5.3530
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ The destiny of saving was scary . ”	-4.2170
I could not believe that it was really there above .	-2.7165
It was wonderful to keep them back into the poor .	-1.8800
The veterinarian declared that if the exhaustion had become too large and had collapsed , it would probably have sunk .	-4.7757
The firefighters have done a fantastic job .	-2.6938
It was really brave , what they did .	-3.6475
We are simply as grateful and everybody was absolutely incredible .	-2.8500
Scott Mikharey added that " We were afraid that she would fall down , but she remained above . "	-7.7077
The firefighters were great .	-1.5483
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.4898
Mick Jagger says he has never made Katy Perry any more than 18 .	-3.8714
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop Star said she was a backrock singer on Jaggers song " Old Men The Hard " from 2004 .	-5.5491
Perry said that she had eaten with the old rock in the evening , and that “ he was asleep when I was 18 . ”	-6.8111
She added : “ This was long ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.7242
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ no sign that he has ever made any approaches at Katy Perry . ”	-5.3651
The representative added : “ Perhaps she has confused him with someone else . ”	-2.6788
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year .	-3.1149
Their new album “ Prism ” landed on first place 1 this week .	-3.9902
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the choice	-2.4055
A new day , a new history of terror for independence .	-1.9465
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-1.7231
This provides the keyword for stories about pass controls by Berwick and a border with barbed wire that runs along the Hadriansbad .	-7.9084
In fact , the Strathcl draft referred to the possible economic benefits that would result in more freedom of movement in the rest of Europe , but this , as expected , did not play a role in the headlines .	-7.9207
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often pursue their strict rules when it is cheaper for them .	-4.6275
Scotland , as it does not belong to the Schengen area at the moment , the continued indifference to Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what one really wants from the Scots .	-5.8401
So no story .	-2.1306
And one that has come so far that it is already like a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” away at least 40 years ago .	-5.7091
An interesting point of continuous repetition of this ancient story is lost .	-4.3017
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe ?	-2.7139
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels , especially now ?	-2.0775
These are the real European news : the big plan for European unification after the war has stalled .	-3.9733
With the euro crisis , Europe ’ s project has officially died .	-2.3199
Parties anywhere in the EU are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to sacrifice the euro as a common currency .	-3.3404
Even in Germany , the eurosceptic party alternative for Germany – established only this year – could secure almost five million votes in the federal election in September and thus effectively free democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) from the parliament .	-6.1050
There have always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-1.8500
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.2836
Because of the tight austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in conjunction with the straightjacket in which the national economy is being forced by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.9152
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-3.0349
Instead , the Eurosystem has identified its members at exchange rates , which are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so .	-4.6661
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe will find itself once again with a built-in productivity input to Germany .	-4.7840
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.2761
Behind the current fiscal and monetary problems is a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.4510
As a result of the Green energy guidelines set by Brussels – a code for subsidies by French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.9977
This is a paralysing cost equivalent , as we have already seen in grants .	-3.9281
All the world ’ s wage manifesto does not protect European petrochemical industries from pressurising cheap US shale gas into the corner .	-4.7334
As a result , revolution is rising , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-3.1673
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and to lift Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.3871
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe into its own economic policy , fighting the hard French economy .	-4.9290
The result is that Marine Le Pen ’ s far-right , anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive re-election , thus suggesting the ruling socialists to three .	-5.9179
The National Front is now France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of the electorate ’ s vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split on the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-5.2120
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white French working class ?	-2.6934
It wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament .	-3.4013
If the EU ’ s anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is a very good thing – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.9398
That is the point I would like to mention : in the not-too-distant future , the widening resentment towards the EU and the common currency will be combined to eliminate the euro .	-6.8513
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” favored by General de Gaulle .	-2.7605
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-3.0608
I expect Britain to be distancing itself from this project in the hope of blitzling itself with the US .	-4.2524
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone will face Atlantic rain .	-2.5709
Where is Scotland left with all this ?	-2.6633
We can decide to be a small England region ( last but not least ) .	-2.8496
Or we can defend our own economic interests – one of which is to say Berlin and Brussels what they can stand where .	-4.4292
I suspect Scotland could go very well in a European network if we retain our own currency .	-3.9670
Cooperation with other countries , similar to those of us , is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations .	-3.6715
Otherwise , we should consider equal treatment for Norway and retain our economic independence .	-2.7481
The SNP government in Scotland is – indeed remarkable – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and imposed ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Coalition had to justify .	-6.0050
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only in order to impose austerity on Berlin and Brussels .	-3.7454
Early puberty : Fast up and higher .	-4.2038
AfroAmerican and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age genomes , as investigations show .	-2.8111
The changes in body do not necessarily imply immediate re-usability .	-6.0535
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.8150
Experts believe that epidemiological obesity is a major factor in early puber.	-3.8207
The trend to early puberty is less pronounced among boys .	-2.8468

Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows at the age of seven or eight years of falling and throat ?	-4.8464
At the annual conference of the Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics , in Orlando , Florida this week , the pediatric endnologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-5.5209
“ I spend a lot of time trying to reassure parents – usually this is no sign that there is now rapid puberty , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-5.7155
The obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , breasts and antelope as well as timing of body , appear earlier .	-7.4485
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarch ( the first bleeding ) over the last 40 years .	-5.0518
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , a little less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.6116
“ When the growth of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the Menarch , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early puberty ” : The essential guide to dealing with this frequently occurring problem .	-9.1748
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty steps forward .	-2.7166
It is controversial , which is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” when the structure of the chest is accompanied by a boost of growth before an age of eight .	-6.1347
In most cases , the process is slowing or stalled – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely .	-3.3683
During quicker advances , tests could be shown by an endologist , so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded .	-4.9534
There are treatments that aim to slow down an early menstruation and defense of another consequence : the early ageing of bones , the ultimate impediment to growth , and thus a small amount of physical growth in adults .	-7.3318
The recommendations for medicinal or hormonal treatments focus on the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .	-4.0300
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-2.0779
Kaplowitz is reticent about medicines , but he admits that “ The oppression of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and feelings of girls , unlike their age genomes . ”	-5.8245
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.9178
“ They care about the maternity risk or how they handle the hygienic page , ” said Kaplowitz .	-4.3150
“ It was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter got ten her days .	-2.5807
Although there were initial signs and we spoke about menstrual , it was emotionally not prepared .	-4.9433
They came scared and excited from school to home because they were the first in their circle of friends .	-2.6704
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-3.0334
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be primary .	-3.2230
Young , like girls , come to puberty earlier .	-5.2591
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic .	-1.2994
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 about girls at the age of six to nine , which provides a connection between body fat and entry into puberty .	-5.0996
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-3.0663
In this country , Brazilian and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age male .	-3.4021
There are different explanations for this .	-1.4093
Global seems to be an early puberty of all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-3.4817
Another mystery : Although the face and shame rate already grows earlier , the trend to full extent of earlier puberty is not as pronounced as among girls .	-7.5865
Other doctors at the AA-conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-2.0010
The appearance of acne and gray is spread even among babies and young children .	-4.3052
" We have to be careful as we identify the true beginning of puberty , " said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endnologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.9344
Parents should not hesitate to consult their paediatrician how they should speak with their .	-3.4481

Jumbo producers argue in the face of large orders over seating width .	-3.3951
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been an argument about the width of seats in the tourist class during long-haul flights , indicating the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.0490
The dispute revolves around the seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who make the most of the effort of airlines , but this recognized space is the key to the efficiency claims of the most recent Airbus aircraft , SAS and Boeing .	-7.6613
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but US naval rival Boeing says that airlines should decide .	-5.1896
The controversy comes at a time when the aircraft producers compete to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range carriers and expect record orders for the event from 17 to 21 November .	-6.0670
How the rear part of the aircraft is constructed – especially if there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results given to the new “ mini Jumbo ” design .	-5.1305
Boeing claims that its modernised " 777X " will mean 406 people in the tourist class who are more than 17 " wide and allow ten per line .	-5.4266
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 comprises 350 people in 18 inch wide tourist seats , with nine per row .	-5.2356
Aviation giants often share hiebe with technical details through advertising in the trade press .	-4.1738
Airbus is now calling for the Dubai Airshow , where 777X , with more than 100 orders , is expected to make the race directly to the public .	-4.7163
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed a picture of donors sitting together in a restaurant with three people , and the title : “ Would you accept it ? ”	-6.6192
“ Boeing proposes long-range flights in the seats that are more close than regional turboprop , ” says Airbus ’ sales chief John Leahy .	-4.7933
In the face of changes in food habits , people are plummeting , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.6021
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined modern long-range flights , and the end of the century , the male average Americans grew by ten percent , according to the US Department of Health .	-5.1299
According to US health statistics , the scale of male average Americans in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm .	-3.3814
Airbus says its Rivale looks at a seating concept from the 1950s , when the average body of the freshly requested “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-5.4612
As an example , Airbus carried out studies that showed that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases the quality of sleep by 53 % .	-6.9118
Boeing denies Airbus figures to its seating dimensions and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines will balance flight tariffs and equipment .	-6.2000
The company also explains that , according to studies , the experience on the plane is more than the seat width .	-5.0340
“ It really is about giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains the aviation expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-4.6502
They do not want us to dictate them what makes them profitable .	-2.6235
You know your business better than any other .	-1.8177
For passengers , this is a matter of greater reliability , but for producers it is becoming increasingly a subject that can affect sales .	-7.2931
Behind the contest is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export record .	-4.9431
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the argument about the new jets .	-2.8263
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 % more efficiency per seat at their latest twin-engine long-haul design than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seat Boeing 77-300ER .	-4.1625
The results of the catch depend partly on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777 .	-5.0126
Increased costs per unit are still less than ten seats per unit currently used .	-3.6038
“ Boeing therefore needs more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Kenton , Head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-4.9596
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per row of existing 777s pointed out that many passengers opted for a closer arrangement , which could be associated with cheaper fares .	-5.4683
“ Eighteen inches of seats would be big for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin installation , foundress and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-6.1123
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalog of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-4.4999
The world ’ s passenger jet vendors even rank bandages to compete .	-5.6823
Even if they prices comfort , all the airlines offer high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-5.2352
Airbus offers a ten-seater A350 , but it has not yet sold its own claim .	-5.4956
Until recently , Airbus has emphasised how important it is to adapt the cabins and to offer broad seats in the corridors for a number of aircraft .	-5.3220
Without the support of the only other major modern manufacturer , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard would probably be sold , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-5.3206
New Anti-nicotine vaccine could make the Garab smoking happy .	-4.5550
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-3.1966
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-2.6938
Other experiments are needed before human tests , which may take some years yet , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-4.5067
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market , but they have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell .	-5.6393
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been altered so that it includes genetic information on the manufacture of nicotine offenders .	-4.4702
The virus selectively infected the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .	-2.9233
The antibody chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving smokers without a glass of high .	-5.5044
In trials of hardened mice used by Nikotin , the normal level of activity is at hand .	-6.8215
The mice without vaccination would have taken off a “ release , ” the researchers said , a sign that Nikotin has reached her brain .	-6.1326
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-2.6118
Previously , tobacco imprints beat , because they contained antibody .	-5.6181
The immunisation had to be given so often that they were expensive and impractical to maintain the disease .	-5.9374
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower , because it turns liver cells into public-sector factories .	-4.2815
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be used for people if he was quite sure to be given to children before they were likely to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-5.9335
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-1.7695
“ You know , if they start to smoke again , they no longer feel a pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , which helps them to shake the habit , ” he explains .	-5.5805
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but they also warned that further research was needed .	-2.9228
Tripodi denies being influenced by Obeid .	-2.9010
Government corruption supervision is taking place against former Secretary of the laboratory party Joe Tripodi from New South Wales .	-5.1882
The former NW minister denies that he has changed the rules on dockyard charges on request of his political mentor , Eddin , who had hidden holdings in three land on state-controlled land .	-8.1390
The Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC - Independent Commission ) , on Friday , extended its investigations into the question of whether indigenous different state ministers have influenced Pachtcontracts at the Circ Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café , without extending their expiry in August 2005 .	-8.9210
It is now being investigated because of the accusation that Tripodi has known the interest in land covered by Obeids , after Tripoli 's previous deputy head , Lynne Ashpolite , said Thursday .	-10.5790
In many years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had pressed for public tenders for the lease contracts .	-3.3320
The couple were opposed to it and also wanted longer periods of time .	-5.6099
In 2009 , the lease contracts for companies became the aggressive Quay , which drove $ 2.5 million each year to the Obeids without public tender .	-7.5729
Tripodi , the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , was originally in favour of public tenders .	-3.1243
But it controversial to have made the changes to the pleas of Obeid , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had forced the government to restructure the Pachreengineer .	-7.5653
One of the ICAC tabled telephone address showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who changed to the port Department after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Agency .	-5.0408
“ Was the issue discussed in these telephone calls to draw up commercial compensation rules ? ” , the deputy Commissioner , Anthony Whealy Triparti , asked .	-6.1202
“ No ” replied tripodi .	-2.4564
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-1.6465

Foreign workers with 45,000 visas could be “ fake ” .	-4.2373
The government is considering measures under way for “ real ” foreign workers with 90-visa .	-6.8457
If the test is introduced , it would be used as a criterion to prevent the 456 being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as the back door for family and friends to Australia .	-5.6977
Today , a government discussion proposal was published after the previous members of the laboratory party , Maxine McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments about foreign workers , because they could be perceived as an insult by neighbors to Australia .	-5.7747
“ In short , statements such as foreigners are supposed to backtrack and , Australians first stop “ are a very unpleasant return to times when trade unions called for a protected labour market , ” she said to Australia ’ s India Institute today .	-14.3844
Historically , it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region embraced an echo of this historical artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.6177
The proposal for a discussion boils down to twelve measures that were once called for by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-6.8428
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who visited talks on human affairs in Sri Lanka yesterday , implemented five of the suggested changes , which are still being considered .	-5.2636
If the “ Authenticity criterion ” is accepted , then anyone who requests a visa could be examined as to whether “ the application is genuine in cases where the applicant is connected or connected to the owner or an relevant person in the supporting company . ”	-7.4991
Companies could also be required to account for the number of the 457-visa holders , after , in the past , when , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have hundreds of people .	-12.2705

A study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-3.5714
In the work of HS2 Ltd , it is proposed that , as early as the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026 , high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England be implemented .	-6.0445
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together ” .	-1.8089
The Scottish Minister for Transport , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-3.0117
Phase 1 is a new high-speed link between London and the West Midlands .	-1.2921
At the end of Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.9884
In June , the government adjusted the estimated cost of constructing the high-speed road between London and Northern England at <unk> 33.7 billion , to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-3.9286
The British Government , which is in contact with Scotland , has appointed HS2 Ltd to look for further flight capacity and travel improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-4.7682
This includes the possibility of a journey from eventual three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.8938
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.8988
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-3.0393
Without it , we face a crisis of capacity in our rail network .	-3.2489
But there is also the connection between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.1346
The Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented : “ The announcement today is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.0361
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-3.6081
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , while at the same time providing Scotland ’ s economic strength an argument for rail connections across the UK . ”	-4.8389
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the UK Government and to investigate the options for a high-speed link in Scotland , which creates benefits for everyone and complements the paper-linked Edinburgh link , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-7.7687
I look forward to looking at the study report with the British ministers next year and jointly deciding the next steps .	-4.1269
Australia 's regulations on electronic aircraft are provisionally in force .	-3.4688
Australian airliners must continue to shut down Tablets and smartphones at start and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease the regulations for such devices .	-5.9001
US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their targets , so that passengers can read , watch , or play videos during critical flight phases of e-Books when they are in “ flying mode ” .	-5.7039
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed , but there are many people annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-4.4009
However , Australian societies observe the decision to implement which US airlines must do little work , but do not pursue immediate plans to amend their regulations .	-6.5112
The CASA aviation control authority also declared that one would look at the announcement , but it emphasized that restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight stages in Australia still apply .	-6.5767
“ CASA currently has no specific rules regarding the use of electronic devices in the aircraft , ” said good-bye .	-4.3415
The issue is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with safety specifications provided by cabin crews .	-5.4715
Virgin has already held discussions with CASA on the expansion of use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and said that it is open to change but that it should be initiated by the legislator .	-6.7643
“ We would welcome a review of the admission of electronic devices by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after offering ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.7628
Qantas declared that it will be kept to the current rules for a moment .	-5.5944
“ Our current guidelines suggest that electronic devices cannot be used when starting and landing , and we currently have no plans to change it , ” the company explained .	-4.8311
The FAA rules apply to American airlines .	-1.9678
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look carefully at the FA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.6528
The decision varies between American companies according to the age of the fleet .	-3.1531
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disruptions through mobile devices , and modify manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer support .	-4.0825
“ Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as Tablets , e-ticketing and smartphones at any height , ” the FAA announced .	-4.9271
In rare cases , in poor visibility , the crew will guide passengers while landing on devices .	-5.6566
The group also recommended that heavier devices be loaded at startup and landing safely under the seat or in the boxes over the seats .	-4.7946

Before the first wave of World Cup matches against VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras reacted with silence .	-6.3150
It was an unwanted acoustic venue , almost already donated to the viewer , which until just before the launch of the German Vice-Chancellor Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the signal Iduna Park .	-8.7556
People were mostly listening to their singing fans .	-4.7505
The southern public gallery against where the most faithful and loudest - soccer fans stand , presented itself with extraordinary silence : no songs , no cries for slaughter .	-7.9153
The podium of the Capo race , otherwise coordinating the joint fire , remained uninterested .	-5.0485
And in the front of the gallery there was a big flag with the labeling section of the football ban .	-7.0489
Only when the goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeler as always sees the place as the first tier soccer player , he threw a short victory .	-9.7320
After his team mate , there were strong vocals and swinging scarf - but not everywhere .	-6.7305
There was nothing in the central blocks of 12 and 13 in the southern public gallery .	-3.4533
Also that stadium performers Norbert Dickel once again had the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbyvictory , Armory victory , the extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - not made any effort .	-7.1565
Just five minutes before the start of the 1500 coup d 'état - and until then , the real tension provoked by hands - the voices , as Dickel as usual , questioned on the slopes in the stadium .	-11.1720
As the last one , the southern public gallery has always been in the row - and at last it has been the most common place in the stadium .	-9.3521
And , at the latest , when the blows from the southern gallery came out the loud call " Derbysieger stands in " , everything was as always .	-7.8132
Silence was a response to what has happened in recent days .	-3.3737
In front of the Bundesliga Bundesliga Bundesliga , some of the top soccer fans had installed their lights into the audience and fired the ball .	-13.6324
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-1.9601
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Wattzke had received the leaders of the Dortmunder Ultras at his office - and think you 're talking about cotton , this was a rather notice notice for the fan representatives .	-7.5462
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultraliberal movement , " said Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.9667
As an emergency measure , Watke told the Ultras a choreography for home games against VfB Stuttgart .	-5.3357
" He explained that I did not " .	-3.7988
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy in relation to pyrotechnics .	-2.1946
Moreover , the Ultras have shown various ways of punishing them - until Tuesday , this time has come to opt for one .	-5.4053
Otherwise , Watchke will set a sanction until the end of next week .	-3.5971
" This is drastic , " said Watzke .	-2.8531
One should be curious about the reactions in the southern gallery .	-5.2145
A deposit of booming houses in Singapore , as the middle class crisis has arrived .	-4.5082
In a deposit house at the Bendemeer shopping mall in Singapore Janani Amirthalinga trades a golden arm , a ring and a couple of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters .	-5.0591
“ My husband and I just bought a house , there is my whole money there , ” says Amirntia .	-3.8002
Although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( about 1,40 euros ) as administrative workers in earn and their husband also work , the monthly family income does not profit , they explains .	-7.3667
In fact , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is rising – is so large that ValuMax , where she shares her exchange , became the third deposit house that is listed on the partition exchange .	-6.6088
The centers of jewellery are not only a fast way to get money – 1,3300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirntia – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loans .	-5.0344
Typically , deposit houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , which is just over 15.4 % , which requires the United Overseas Bank , a local lender of a subsidiary in the same shopping center .	-6.5749
However , deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need for credit rating or income proof to be reviewed , which is why loans are faster than banks are possible .	-5.4996
That is why millions of people in the region are coming to deposit houses after families feel the pressure from increasing living costs and increasing budgetary and consumer debt .	-4.9190
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap financial lending in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income mortgages are seeking to compensate for the difference in fragile economies .	-5.7066
This week , the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing debt , mainly through rising mortgages , called a risk factor for Asian banks .	-3.4384
Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore , according to the Agency , have the highest levels of debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-3.4844
Malaysia is at the top of the list with 80 % of GDP , 60 % rise in 2008 .	-3.8220
Economists also worry about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand this week , which has just come out of a technical recession .	-5.0943
On Thursday , the data showed a persistent export slowdown and a lowering of consumer demand .	-3.9791
“ Ultimately , this means that , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their incomes wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wu , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-5.1513
Historical ceilings at gold prices over the last two years have reinforced the trend for the catering of personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-6.4349
In Singapore , approximately 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 deposit houses of the city state of gold .	-4.2265
People say : “ The gold price looks good , let ’ s mortgage the gold chain back next month . ”	-3.8768
The largest Thai deposit operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20-percent customer growth in its stores in recent months .	-4.3865
The growth in a deposit business is so strong that ValuMax , the owner of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighboring Malaysia – where the company runs four houses – but also outside Asia , so ah Lee Ching , manager of ValuMax .	-6.5269
The company is financing the $ 60 percent of the 66 million Singapore dollar that took place this week at the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-5.1092
While some creditors were on the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yellen declared that deposit houses not only issued lower interest rates than other lending , but also did not directly raise the debt .	-6.4372
“ Customer objects that they already own , and the devaluation of personal property does not increase their household debts , ” explains them .	-5.7594
The deposit business is increasingly accepted as a short-term , secure financing .	-4.2450
Nor are all those who use deposit loans in financial difficulties .	-2.6888
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValuMax to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price .	-4.8030
Customers come from every social class to us .	-3.5387
“ These include charity that short-term lending something for a business or investment , or small companies that need to bridge the bottlenecks in cash-flow , ” says Yelah .	-5.4746

rescue package of more than $ 325 million Australian health care .	-5.2884
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of more than $ 325 million of Australia ’ s health-care system to ensure that the state government cannot waste money .	-8.1940
The German Minister for Health , Tanya Pliberek , has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions .	-4.8098
The funding for a period of four years was decided by the independent federal Member Andrew Wilkie , according to government consultations .	-4.9724
“ The government has created an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the state , ” said Pliberek today .	-4.7656
The $ 325-million package includes $ 31 million in emergency support for electoral services .	-5.2305
More than 2600 operations , including orthopedic intervention and treatment for gray Star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-5.6037
In addition , there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better rehabilitation for hospital stays , department exchange , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-5.1961
“ This investment is in line with the ideas of the clinicians I have told me that they are the best way to improve the tabian health system , ” said Tanya Pliberek .	-6.3092
The minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman government .	-3.5894
The state must maintain the current level of funding to be able to receive money from the Commonwealth , and monthly reports on where additional money has been spent .	-4.6970
A three headed Commission will be set up and will ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.9605
As Wilkie said today , $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would make the public purse more sustainable . ”	-5.3866
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed towards the Prime Minister in early May .	-3.2871
“ I am confident that Federal aid will make a major contribution to bringing the state ’ s public health system off the list , ” Wilkinson said .	-3.8746
According to the state government , these elections will largely offset the recent cuts .	-2.6291
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman at federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ corridor solution . ”	-3.7500
“ We are in a position today because the laboratory government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said against ABC TV .	-3.7201
It cannot be that a government of the State is cutting down almost half a billion dollars from the system and in the Commonwealth , and then doing as if that were good news .	-6.3440
Dutton called on Pliberek to ensure that not one dollar of the bailout package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-3.6799

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such as a monitoring group .	-2.6023
Syria has destroyed important institutions for the production of chemical weapons and Gitton-gas ammunition , said Thursday that the global chemical weapons monitoring group , while severe confrontations in the north of the country were near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are to be stored .	-7.6521
On Thursday , a Syrian activist said that more than 120,000 people had been killed soon since the start of the civil war .	-4.4350
The organization 's announcement of the ban on chemical weapons ( OPCW ) came a day before the deadline .	-2.9005
1 November , which the organisation of Damascus , based in The Hague , set to destroy all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to make “ inoperate , ” including all of the machines for the mixing of chemicals into toxic gas and the filling of ammunition .	-6.2990
The completion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone for an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014 .	-5.1664
The destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.2902
But Damascus must begin by destroying existing weapons and stocks .	-2.9243
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senfgas and nerve gas in Sarin .	-2.6736
The announcement came at a time when , on Thursday , struggles took place in the city of Safaga , experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons , as well as storage facilities reported in the United Kingdom 's Syrian Observatory for Human Rights .	-5.8451
The activist who is following the number of deaths across a network of activists in Syria stated on Thursday , 120.296 people died .	-5.5779
Of these , 61.067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-2.4184
On the government side , 29,954 of them belong to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18.678 are pro-government fighters and 977 Lebanese militias .	-5.0709
Also among the dead were 2.202 describing army data , and 5.375 fighters of the opposition , many of them foreigners .	-4.5222
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011 .	-1.6319
This number has not been updated .	-1.5249
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-1.7895
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting for weeks in Safaga against the rebels , many of which have connections with Al Qaeda groups .	-2.8769
The observatory said that on Thursday there were losses on both sides , but did not mention details .	-3.1714
The fighting highlights the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed , because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arsenal is a race against the time amid a raging civil war .	-5.2887
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen all the major production and mixing facilities mentioned by Syria and experienced its destruction . ”	-4.8434
Therefore , “ no other inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-2.7186
At the beginning of the week , the inspectors explained that they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-4.0707
Because of safety considerations , the inspectors said that they could not visit two facilities .	-3.8049
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to Syrian saying ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapons program were transferred to other facilities that were insolvent . ”	-6.5300
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safaga was one of the two institutions that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.4802
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the Electoral Committee next month .	-3.1760
“ I salute the dancing and the courage that you all shown when you complete the most challenging mission that was carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uconsuming , the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization , in a comment published by OPCW .	-7.3839
For three years now , the main Sunni Muslim groups have been fighting against Assad ’ s government and its security forces , many members of Alawites , for a secession of Shia Islam .	-3.8621
As for further developments , the head of the Observatory , Rami Abursraman , said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-5.1797
He did not know the cause of the explosion .	-2.5518
Confronting anger about Bali ’ .	-4.4389
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in Bali in 2002 during the Bali bombing responded positively to the judgment for the last of the burrs to be brought before the courts , as Umar Patek believes that she should be shot legally .	-7.4455
Patek , who was just ten years away as one of the most visited Southeast Asian people , was condemned yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bombing of a sentence of 20 years .	-6.5941
He could be dismissed after 15 years of imprisonment .	-2.8432
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the excessive attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.9570
A sentence was also made in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Holy evening in 2000 .	-6.0937
The Prosecutor ’ s Office had requested life imprisonment , even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man , who is known as the master bomb builder as the “ Demlition Man . ”	-7.2689
The decision provoked painful memories at June Coreen , a mother from Perth who lost his 39 years old twin daughters , Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his associates nearly ten years ago .	-5.6426
In tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-3.5913
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other candle .	-2.5944
" One should put him before a shooting command , " Coreen said against AP .	-4.4631
I have to live every day by not having another grandsons and I will never see my daughters anymore .	-4.2795
The Sari Club was the ground floor , when , just after 23 October 2002 , a massive bomb was launched in a small , aid explosive just outside the night club .	-6.9853
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bombers were able to explode with explosive backpack .	-5.4349
After the attack , he fell into Koma and “ died ” three times during a life accounting system .	-4.4372
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiciah – Amrozi , Mukhalas and Imam Samuendra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-4.9687
Indeed , this type should be given the death penalty above all .	-3.5590
To leave him alive – no , there is no reason to leave him alive .	-2.8032
Twenty years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds , it is not much to get .	-6.9905
Patek is the last of the Bali-Bomber people to be tried .	-5.4152
He discloses for nearly a decade of arrest , but eventually , in January 2011 , he was picked up in Pakistan ’ s city of Abbrevid , where US forces nearly four months later killed the former Al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden .	-6.3473
During the negotiation , an FBI-Agent said that secret service reports had given the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of restoring the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and Al Qaeda .	-6.3973
“ He did not settle , ” said Coreen .	-4.2045
Until recently , he has failed to predict how much suffering he has caused to other people .	-4.2592
The verdict came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack in Bali and Australia .	-3.8289
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corvena .	-2.7267
Patek can still appeal against his ruling .	-2.7552
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but not mobile phones ) .	-4.4911
Air passengers can now hear their electronic devices for reading , work , games , music and the image of films from departure until landing , but not using the mobile phone , so the new directives issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the US on Thursday .	-6.4693
However , passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-7.6129
As soon as they were implemented , exit from the airline concerned , FA employees Michael Huersa declared a press conference .	-4.8129
The airlines have to prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manual of the flight staff and the rules for transferring the equipment according to the new rules .	-10.6000
The FAA explained that it has already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-4.2299
They also included Delta and JetBlue .	-2.4258
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could authorise the increased use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-5.5364
Passengers now need to turn smart phones , tablets and other devices down when the aircraft doors are closed .	-4.0778
They will only be allowed to start again if the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain will give the green light .	-5.0554
When entering the landing , passengers must turn them off again and not start them again before the plane has landed .	-6.4374
According to the new directives , airlines that are safe from electronic disruption would allow their passengers to use their devices even when they start , landing , and rolling field were told by the FAA .	-6.4758
Most new traffic aircraft and other aircraft converted to Wi-Fi in larger heights should meet the criteria .	-4.4865
Laura Glading , President of the professional union of professional cabin crews , welcomed the changes .	-2.5428
“ If the new regulation is implemented securely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented Glavng .	-5.4674
We are , frankly , sorry to have to feel like staying on this issue .	-4.7729
However , Internet links for surfing , exchange of e-mails , text messages or downloads of data under three kilometres remain prohibited , explained the Authority .	-5.0492
Passengers are invited to empower smart phones , tablet , and other devices in flight mode .	-3.8139
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble similar online game played by the actor Alec Baldwin 2011 on his smartphone , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines on the public , refusing to disconnect the device while the plane was on the platform .	-7.2019
And heavier devices such as laptops will still have to be stow away because there is a risk of injury when they fly through the cabin .	-4.1838
Mobile phones during the flight are also still prohibited .	-2.9374
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-1.5800
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic devices at startup and landing .	-2.9866
Last month , Mark Rosenker said of the National Safety Board ’ s Transport Safety Board , Security Advisory for National Transport Issues at CBS News , Mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-4.1641
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruptions to navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transmitting can also disrupt transmitting the air , ” says Rosenker .	-6.7237
A consulting committee of the industry which was set up by the FAA to investigate this issue last month recommended that the government take the lead of greater use of personal electronic devices .	-5.7647
In recent years , pressure has increased to the FAA to ease restrictions for use .	-2.9291
Critics such as the Democratic Senate Majaire McCain from Missouri argue that there are no valid grounds for prohibition .	-4.0167
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of devices has become ubiquitous .	-2.7755
In some studies there is talk that up to one third of passengers forgets or ignores the off of the device .	-5.4045
The FAA began in 1966 to reduce the use of electronic devices by air passengers after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment were known by passenger car radios , which at the time were the latest technology trends .	-5.8144
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed in this way and approved by the FAA that electronic interference does not represent them .	-4.0337
For a number of years passengers have been offering Wi-Fi when height is reached .	-5.6178
The planes fitted on Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interference .	-4.6614
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new guidelines , Huersa said .	-3.8487
Today 's electronic devices generally give much less radio radiation than previous generations .	-2.2693
E-readers , for example , only give minimal radiation if you convert .	-4.7245
However , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.5696
One of the proponents of a relaxation of restrictions on the use of devices by passengers counts Amazon.com.	-4.0903
In 2011 , the company staff luke a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to determine problems , but could not find .	-6.4429
Members of the FAA-Consultative Committee have mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.9811
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Seekers said that he believes that the disruption of the equipment is genuine , even if the risk is minimal .	-6.1513
Other crew members said that there were only isolated reports of pilots who would be in favour of a disruption of aircraft systems by the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-5.1934
However , the FAA committee recommended that pilots be allowed to order the transfer of equipment by passengers in case of instrument accumulations under poor visual conditions .	-6.7429
A travel industry group welcomed the changes and called them a sensible adjustment for travellers , who would be equipped with technology today .	-5.4015
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association said .	-3.4856
Per air rescue service from North Sea drilling Island rescued bird .	-6.0612
A bird powered by air rescue service on the coast , which had been found on a North Sea island , has once again been dismissed .	-6.0261
The waterways were flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was rounded up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its rescue center in Allia .	-6.4299
Colin Seddon , Head of the Centre , said : “ This waterways was probably a winter coach from Northern Europe who was held back by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-5.1889
Apparently the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-2.6429
He added : “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.3137
On their release , the waterways were again fit and healthy .	-3.5024
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.6304
Business for Britain was started in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and define what those who work in Britain want to change to our relations with the EU .	-4.6365
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.2803
Youv interviewed more than 1,000 executives from the economy , comprising about the British company sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.9759
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-2.1462
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe , concentrating on countries that modernise and grow while the EU is stagnating .	-4.7434
They want government side to favour new trade ties with countries such as China , India , and Brazil , rather than breaking up with the long and hard process of reforming the EU institutions .	-5.3754
In their view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster .	-4.0189
There was widespread discontent about the internal market , as companies have said that the costs of Brussels ’ regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies voted in favour of those traditionally the most pro-European .	-6.3176
Finally , and this is probably the most to say , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course toward change of the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade .	-6.5690
This insight , found in businesses of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the game of action back to Britain .	-5.2998
Much is at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain at 16 % would lead to a change of opinion in favour of leaving the EU in a referendum .	-4.6020
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership .	-3.1225
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations to the UK in renegotiation of the process .	-4.2033
A better deal is possible and increasingly necessary for the UK economy , after the eurozone moves towards closer economic and fiscal union .	-3.3493
Priority must be given to jobs and growth in Britain , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-5.9882
Alexei Miller of Gazprom is the pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas leak .	-3.7018
The construction start of the Southside pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the biggest European energy projects , the Gazprom Executive Board declared .	-3.7645
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction work on the Bulgarian part of the Southside gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , ” said the chairman of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-4.2348

A dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , is responsible for an increased risk of conventional routes , as official hearing .	-5.3335
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ eliminated forever . ”	-2.4622
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at special rates when the entire project goes into operation in 2015 .	-2.7650
According to Gazprom , construction is to begin in other countries on the planned route by the end of the year .	-3.6110
The pipeline is geared towards an annual capacity of 6,3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-3.4008

hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff charges against Jonathan Lord for sex offences .	-5.2945
Two YMCA-staff from New South Wales ( NW ) were charged for sexual abuse in connection with children before , in 2011 , accusations were made against the care of Lord Childcare Jonathan from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children were told .	-6.9431
But , at the Commission ’ s opening statement , YMCA stated that “ in the organization , one never had to do with an incident of sexual child abuse . ”	-5.9556
General Philopo Harpe was interviewed at a case in which a YAMCA employee was charged for child pornography offences , and another in which a sports teacher of YMCA Carinbah Hall in 1991 was sentenced for abuse of infected children .	-7.8659
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission ’ s assistants that he knew of the first case , but he did not recognize the second .	-4.8899
He acknowledged that the opening statement by the YMCA to the Commission was also imprecise in his assertion that “ there were external checks of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety . ”	-6.3196
The evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities in August of the year .	-4.5470
Hare , who started with 21 at YMCA , acknowledged that the management “ I refused to go back ” to the hiring of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the guidelines on child safety .	-6.2257
Lord was condemned at the beginning of the year for sexual slavery by twelve boys during his two years of activity for YMCA .	-3.7969
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.2912
However , Hare argued that the YMCA would have a cultural problem preventing employees from reporting Loris AntiRights for children ’ s safety .	-5.6641
The staff said they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , kept them privately owned as a baby sitter , sitting on his lap , saying that he liked it , and that children were allowed to play with his mobile phone .	-7.1469
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord was and asked for a training for the protection of children because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that Jacqui Barnat , who was the preselected priest in YMCA Carinbah , was “ very biased and most of the time very incongruous . ”	-8.2265
The managing director said that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report to their superiors .	-4.5047
Instead , he said that his friendship with Lord affected their judgment , which is why they would not have reported him .	-5.7144
Hare explained that he told the board of the YMCA NW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “ Jonathan-Lord-incident ” was “ not going to speak ” by staff , and the Executive Board agreed to him .	-7.5674
Hare said that the decision to force staff to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations were made was made by the managing director of the Children ’ s services of YMCA , Liam Whiteley .	-5.5202
He said that it was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence , but that was ‘ excessive ’ and poorly implemented .	-5.5441
The YMCA NW was not a safe organization for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was busy between 2009 and 2011 , Professor Stephen Smallbone told of the Griffith University , an expert on sexual abuse of children , the Commission .	-6.0515

In an interview this evening at the fifth anniversary of his expulsion from office , the 59-year-old proclaimed his views on various domestic issues .	-4.0750
Since his resignation in June 2007 , following a decade of leadership , Blair has largely avoided making a statement on British politics , and his comments have largely been limited to foreign policy and its role as spokesperson for the Quartet of peacemakers in the Middle East .	-6.6422
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted in the words ‘ yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , that is ... ’	-4.8057
When the harpoons of experts entering droves in Cardiff to break the year 's horse , they were aware that a tough competition was imminent .	-7.3581
But none was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-3.4625
The stick , which is not even in the nursery , and only a few months ago took his first steps , and his Shetland Pond Toffee fell loose by the three rounds and won the first prize – with 30 adult opponents left behind .	-7.5301
The undimilar pair , both equal to size , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition held by the Grandbank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-6.6346
At his performance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had set up his dishwasher in a freaking angle and led the two years old toffee by the ring .	-10.1018
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony , who ran well beyond his age .	-3.4880
And Tocqueville received good marks for his appearance and personality .	-3.5693
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift for his third birthday and had been treating the Shetland Pony every day .	-5.8426
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great listener . ”	-2.0847
They had to compete against the entire field of participation and have gone out of place with gold medal and rose rose .	-6.8094
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee , and we were all thrilled when he won .	-4.2183
He was completely strangers in the arena for so great that she wanted to take photographs .	-5.5192
The small boy from the village of Nantygloss near Ebbw Vale , South Wales follows in the footsteps of his Tante Sharon Howlin , who has been riding horses for more than ten years .	-5.2054
Howden told : “ The entire audience was like electrifying and everyone exposed it and applauded . ”	-5.5461
He spent the whole length of the arena on sand and even though he was so tiny , he has done a fantastic job .	-6.4933
Fenton is mad for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farm farms and has two chickens to take care of .	-4.2257
As he started , it will not take long until he is on the “ horse of the year ” – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.0630

I am sure Fenton 's sweet clothes have contributed their part to making the fit really perfect occasion .	-4.7785
China ’ s newspaper is to be “ reformed ” .	-3.1463
A Chinese newspaper calling for a reporter to be released on the front page , accused of defamation , declared a press regulator .	-4.6245
Guangdong based New Express had printed a rare public call for the release of the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-3.8142
But Chen later released on television that he had adopted bribes to spook reports of a partial state-owned company .	-3.5659
Now the new Express will undergo a “ comprehensive update , ” the regulators explained .	-5.2979
The restoration order was launched by the Ministry of Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-4.0824
Preliminary investigation revealed that the New Express , which is part of the Yangheng Evening News Group , published several false reports about the publicly traded company Zoklilion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-4.8048
“ New Express ’ s editorial management was disordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-3.4273
She said , “ a administrative punishment for Chen ’ s Chen to be imposed and removing his reporters . ”	-5.9594
In addition , “ the Yangngg Evening News Group has been required to make a complete deposit of the New Express and recommended that the relevant officials be identified at the New Express and instantly check the management team of the New Express . ”	-7.9845
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities at a manufacturer of construction machinery called Zoom .	-4.2502
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and set behind his journalistic work .	-3.0023
But then Chen went on to state television and said that he had published false reports on payment .	-4.7187
“ In this case , I damaged Zolion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public trust , ” he explained to the state news broadcaster CCTV .	-4.6068
I did it primarily because I was at the expense and fame .	-3.6447
I have become clear that I have been mistaken .	-4.2011
After having received his apologies , the New Express published an apology on the front page , saying that we failed to check the reports correctly .	-5.2868
Various well-known suspects have recently taken place on television confessions .	-2.3286
Experts say that confessions are still being routinely enforced , despite a legislative amendment at the beginning of the year in which the authorities have been prohibited , forcing someone to blame themselves .	-5.6030
Discover drugs tunnel with its own railway between the US and Mexico .	-4.0013
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway operations , has now been discovered .	-4.2539
The US authorities describe the 120 times 90 centimetres of the tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they have ever found .	-4.0914
The tunnel , which runs through a length of almost six football fields in Zickzackar , connects warehouses close to Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-5.4941
There are countless vacant warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide trucks with drugs .	-3.9163
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported there , the authorities said .	-4.5315
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine have been assured , the records of the court .	-3.9868
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged for ownership and the intended sale of Marihuana and cocaine .	-5.3808
They threaten imprisonment between ten years and life for a sentence .	-4.5945
In Nocgales , Arizona , Dumngler set up an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-5.7657
The tunnel is the eighth big passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.2325
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which presents the challenge of drugs cartels in how they can quickly bring their product to consumers .	-4.9083
In 2010 , authorities established a nearly 640 m long passage with a kitchen in a residential building in Tijuana , Spain , to two storage houses in San Diego .	-6.0538
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still love .	-2.4166

actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.7100
In an interview with U.S. journalist Katie Couric , who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " Life sometimes does not go exactly as we plan or hope it " .	-4.2905
The 36-year-old was still loved by the Germans .	-7.1453
" We will support each other and love ourselves as parents of Flynn " .	-3.3273
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , in 2011 their Söig Flynn was born .	-3.6790
Veganism is a vegetarian subject according to lexicon , but is different from it in a very significant way .	-6.6073
For while vegetarian , allow yourself to be consumed by the cream resorts , ice or a powerful Edamet , these cherries are not on the menu of a Veganers .	-7.3731
In addition to the absence of meat and fish , the Vegan is made from all animal products - also honey is said .	-6.0199
What remains , one may wonder , but the vegan nutrition world is characterized by a considerable resourcefulness .	-5.4454
" Brotaufstriche are very popular " , explains Utae Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , which has a variety of special products for vegans .	-3.9224
You can also visit the shop at the Domgasse .	-3.4609
For 13 years , the born New Zealand vesan , Lammertheis finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " 1997 I set my diet and became vegetarian .	-5.7555
At the turn of the century was the next step and I became a vegan .	-2.6115
" But the conviction came not only because of the diet but because of the shoe selection , " said Proctor , the user of normal leather .	-7.7135
It recognised that it is also in other everyday situations without animal products .	-4.5087
First and foremost , vegan is ethics .	-1.4861
" I do not want animals to die for me " , explains the maxim of Vegan , which affects all consumer behaviour .	-4.6230
Rather than Burgern , wipers , or rubber balls mourned , the Vegans quickly discovered completely new products that increased enthusiasm .	-7.4548
" It is a double bonus " , says Protor today , " actually constitutes vegan not a loss , but is an enrichment " .	-5.6460
And precisely these conditions , some even so well-meaning attempts were successful .	-5.1552
" The addictive factor is a very crucial factor that causes many to drop down quickly , as in the case of smoking , " umptor points a comparison .	-7.4551
And applies one : " Certain tastes are not tied to the animal " .	-5.1168
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-4.3983
" You can also generate the same effect in other ways , " explains the Vegan .	-3.4731
Proctor is also used to create a grill , for example Aubergines , mushrooms and a few Vegans .	-6.9803
It respects a balanced , varied diet in which it should also be tasting tasting .	-5.9267
Of course we want to have something between the teeth , which is legitimate .	-3.6699
" It is to be tasted , but that is not just to reduce animal food , " said Proctor .	-5.0203
He did not suffer any serious damage to health problems , a further widespread assumption .	-6.1607
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.4937
I do not import foreign cholesterol and have a higher vitamin content .	-3.3320
There are high-performance sports to feed exclusively vegan .	-2.9501
" My blood values are excellent , I often check my fingers " and tell me Protor .	-6.2894
Especially against the lack of vitamin B12 warning many Vegan critics .	-3.7815
" Since animals are fed with feedingstuffs , rather than on grazing , it is questionable whether in the meat purchased in the refrigerator the vitamin B12 ratio is high , " Proctor finds .	-9.5795
Vegans can take the form of tablets .	-3.6904
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.6705
Much must not be done by Proctor for food procurement .	-4.7315
Food commodity is finally available everywhere and every supermarket has soya milk and other products .	-4.7807
I find everything I need on site .	-3.0806
I am only buying anything special from and on .	-4.8558
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but this is how " ordinary " product products are known to be " .	-4.7617
Their founder in business was the preparation of vegan courts , much cheaper and less time-consuming than generally accepted .	-7.8314
" There is a lot to discover in the kitchen , with a few small knits you can achieve good , if not partly better results " , says Proctor .	-5.7296
Not only does it take place with butter , something more dry powder and carbon dioxide , but with its sweet cheese cellars it was also possible to bring its parents into the cellars .	-10.2682
A new buzz for the Vegan family .	-5.1878
This dynamic , if you cook together , is a new priority .	-5.0599
" The situations that can arise arise are as diverse as the people themselves " says Proctor .	-4.9938
But he has , of course , already gained skepticism .	-4.9477
Do you no longer have my food ?	-3.5345
" Should I feel bad now , because I drink milk ? " - if so , you have to act as a vegan with a fingertips .	-6.6442
" I do not disagree with the people , I am part of this society , " Reporters do not want a legal career .	-5.3345
And , more accurately , the everyday world does not seem like suspected - and Vegans do not suffer as commonly thought in everyday life .	-7.2100
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.1988
And so there are so many things !	-5.8137
" Many Dönerverkauf offer falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-6.6440
In a pizzeria he differs from pasting , or just ordered a pizza without cheese , everything a question of habit .	-5.6228
The restaurants are so slow on this .	-3.7509
" When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult " , the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to the people to draw attention to it " .	-5.2709
" If there are enough requests for questioning , they may be inclined to add the menu " he hopes .	-4.4653
Vegane restaurants develop , such as the comedys in Mannheim or the Café Bird .	-4.5514
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants will have at least a vegan meal on the menu .	-5.3991
Essentially , vegan courts are there for all .	-2.8893
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.1906
'Meat dishes are , however , exclusive , in the true sense of the word , for they exclude others ' , PROctor decides .	-6.3875
" If you want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way to make the allergic part impossible from the outset " , says Protor .	-4.7271
At the beginning , however , shoppers can be rather difficult .	-4.4597
In particular , if you learn to understand that animal additives in the world may also contain them as a human source , then with the respect of ethics , you can quickly leave the courage to overcome so many hurdles and traps .	-10.1715
Not only have Reutben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients , but also cleaning products included .	-4.9195
" After and after developing a scanner on the right and know which sign and logo you have to respect , " It is sometimes better to take small steps than admitted or too close " , says Protor .	-8.5065
Veganism , it is an important moral fingerprint that beats consciousness .	-4.4274
Perhaps he does not entirely create his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically challenge his habits .	-4.1994
The provider Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers breathless .	-3.2898
The trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon German .	-4.8317
In a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .	-2.6102
The other 11 US options markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business freely .	-2.3770
The recent incident continues a series of minor and larger mishaps on the stock operator .	-4.4585
Only on Tuesday did the Nasdaq indexes not be calculated for an hour because of errors in data transport .	-4.7317
In August of this year , there were two mishaps in one week alone .	-3.3073
First , the U.S. investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent bulk faulty orders to the option markets for technical problems .	-4.8038
In response , stock exchange operators needed almost a day to check and remove orders .	-4.9170
Two days after that , half of the total equity trade in the US came to a halt due to a computer panic at the Nasdaq county for several hours .	-5.2819
It was also a highlight last year of the stock exchange on Facebook .	-5.5478
The Nasdaq systems were not up to the flood of purchase and sales orders , later on , the company decided on SEC and then sold a record penalty of $ 10 million .	-7.0497
Konstance : cyclists are driving 63-year-olds around	-5.4204
On the accident , the police reported that when a 26 year-old man on Thursday evening , against 22 p.m. , a ladies ' wheel was in breach of the left foot from the station square in the direction of the market place . the of .	-12.6133
When a restaurant suddenly went on the way back to 63 years of old man , police force drivers were unable to slow on time .	-8.2781
During the subsequent collision , the pedestrians were pressed against the house wall , moving further to the ground and took about 15 centimetres of the head .	-6.8471

British police forces are making Assange a delivery certificate .	-3.9935
The British police have today handed over a proof of extradition to WikiLeaks ’ founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and requested asylum in the Ecuadorian embassy in London .	-4.5603
Scotland Yard explained that he “ invited the 40-year-old Australians to face up ” asking him to appear in a police guard , and added , if he did not honour that , threatened him to arrest .	-7.3767
Assange is threatening extradition to Sweden for charges in a sexual offence after his ability to comply with British law , since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to the extradition at the beginning of the month .	-6.2539
As he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the US , he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.8860
Scotland Yard “ a 40-year-old man sent a call to raise himself at a time when we were elected to a police guard , ” said a speaker .	-6.4128
He continues to violate the terms of his release .	-1.9652
The message did not leave a comment on the delivery of the police invitation .	-3.5396
He is fearful of being extradited from Sweden to the United States for possible spy charges , having published over 250,000 diplomatic messages on the Twitter website WikiLeaks .	-6.1397

Howie was guilty before the Colchester court , without the necessary care and attention .	-4.8634
He received seven points and a six-month ban on driving .	-2.2714
Howden was also condemned to pay costs of 90 <unk> and to a contract of 100 <unk> .	-4.7947
Tax on foreign property owners against London ’ s speculation bubble	-1.4045
The Treasury has calculated the CGT measure on a provisional basis , but it is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who , in the 2012 budget , had imposed a 7 % deposit on housing that cost more than GBP 2 million , and annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a company rather than as individuals .	-7.7067
Already , revenue from residential property stamps in the area Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which stood at <unk> 708 million in 2012 / 13 , income for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-West , Yorkshire , and the Humber region combined .	-5.9063
Cook said : “ After the increases in charge of stamps on highly priced apartments and the introduction of the legislation associated with them to bypass , it is difficult to claim that high quality properties are too low , regardless of the impact of the obsolete local tax system . ”	-7.6001
“ But this move could reverse some foreign investors in terms of buying real estate in London , or holding owners of it , ” he added .	-4.5662
High-class property – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at a price – in the affluent London southwest belt , which spans from Fulham to Wimbledon , has increased by the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-6.3224
The prices in Central London were similar annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market ” in which the southern western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the East ( 6.5 % ) experienced a upward trend , an investigation of Savimeses .	-5.9245
Scientists were able to shed more light on the correlation between a dog 's tail with its mood .	-4.7699
Early research had shown that happy dogs with the tail more left after right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while with nervous dogs it was the left side .	-4.9941
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and respond to them .	-2.3056
Professor Georgio Vallorza ’ s addition to a neuroscientist from the University of Trento said : “ People know that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-5.6518
Here we tried to view this with other species .	-2.9470
He also noticed that , as with humans , the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two mental disorders played different roles in feelings .	-4.7546
To learn more about how dogs react to their hand ’ s monster monster , researchers are monitoring the animals while these films attract other dogs .	-7.0901
dimensions of the heart rate of the four-legged and analyzed the behavior .	-3.1440
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in the one direction , sometimes the other .	-4.6879
Professor Vallorpa ’ s addition said : “ We have shown the dogs ’ movies with dogs – either a natural faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate other aspects , and we were able to control the movement of the tail more left or right . ”	-6.5428
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the cock to the right ( seen from the perspective of the weaves dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.1874
But if the tail ascent was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the weaves ) , its heart rate rose and it was untranquil .	-6.8349
In the opinion of Professor Vallorfer ’ s amendments , dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-4.8464
It is rather convinced that dogs have learned from experience of what movements they should be concerned about and when not .	-4.3864
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the babes are connected to the tail in a direction more friendly and the right side produces less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-7.3070
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians and trainees could help to better understand the emotions of their animal .	-4.9778
John Bradshaw , expert in dog behaviour and guest grant cases at the University of Bristol 's Faculty of Animal Medicine , stated that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right was important for dogs .	-5.7125
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head on the left when watching an aggressive dog , and right when they are a satisfied dog .	-5.0988
In a different research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ dogs tend to go on a robot dog when his tail , turns left and not turn right , rather than becoming slippery – is different than in the Italian study . ”	-7.1634
According to his statement , the differences could therefore be felt that in the various studies dogs did not interpret animals in films or robots as dogs .	-5.0264
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.0814
“ Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammalian animals that the two cerebral hemispheres are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception there , ” said Bradshaw .	-4.1777
But , because their behavior is easy to record , it will probably not take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves into one direction , sometimes the other .	-5.6504
Celtic Monkeys shift performance in Glasgow due to the illness Alex Turner .	-5.9205

Pope Francis will perform in February the first cardinal act .	-5.7671
Pope Francis will be the first to use new cardinal channels from the Catholic Church on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-4.7131
The channels are the highest priests in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-6.5205
Currently there are 201 radio channels .	-2.5896
However , a Cardinal who has reached 80 years of age can no longer take part in the Papal election – this falls to a group of 120 " legitimate cardinal lines " .	-5.6949
In a statement in which the message was given , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman for the Vatican , said that there will be a meeting of all the Cardinal channels before the ceremony is held for the appointment of the new Cardinal , also known as a constitution court .	-6.7757
“ Pope Francis decided to make his decision on the convening of the Constitution known in February in advance so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinal objects from all over the world can be planned , ” Lombardi said .	-5.6608
Jack Valero of Catharic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinal channels would probably have declined until February .	-4.2151
He explained that a Pope usually had as many a Cardinal as necessary to bring the number of eligible Cardinal lines back 120 , and so many co-channels over 80 as he wants .	-7.1801
Next year 's constitution is significant because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , according to Valero .	-3.5773
At present , there is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , of Italy .	-3.7384
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint a Cardinal from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-2.8528
Fifty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only one tiny number of cardinal streets .	-2.1956
The channels of Cardinal will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Cardinal , founded by Francis , a group of eight churches from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the church .	-6.9333
In the past , the Pope chose everything alone .	-2.9296
" Well , Francis selected this eight co-channels to help him , " said Valero .	-3.9097
He explained that it was “ good possible ” that Francis the Cardinal channels ask for advice .	-5.6919
So far , however , we have not been able to do this – it is all new .	-4.4626
Valero said that typically the bishops from large villages would become a Cardinal , but pose Francis “ full of surprises – so we do not know who they will appoint . ”	-5.5042

Obama ’ s memoir in the 2008 election campaign was a sad reminder of what could have been possible .	-2.2536
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at the Harvard Medical School .	-4.2736
I 'm currently reading a sad book .	-2.9334
It is a book I believed there would be some hope for me during the bleak second year of my medical college .	-5.1775
It is called “ The Audamcity to Win ” ( brave enough to win ) and portrays the memoir Barack Obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .	-4.1015
When I am ready to sleep with my patients in the evening , the book brings me back to a time when the politics of millions could be inspired and brained in the air .	-9.7098
The election was held as a landslide victory and news speaker to show the historic significance of this hour .	-4.9337
My classmates , with joy and my parents , collected all the newspapers they could find .	-4.3514
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was prepared for change .	-2.7920

Once again , turn on the present is a bad awakening , as if one is drawn from a dream .	-6.0807
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.2484
In the years since I first made my vote , something has actually changed .	-4.1270
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.2649
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance until the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced prostitution of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.6119
I also believe that the party ’ s block tactics have swept too many efforts into bringing our nation forward : immigration reform , public health insurance option , and Guantanamo Bay ’ closure , to name just a few .	-6.3671
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances , I have ended with my explanation .	-4.2260
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.1834
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders permit surveillance or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-4.1898
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ private lives , and why whistleblowers are punished , displaying government behavior .	-4.4504
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and spending limits will be evaded during the presidential elections .	-4.7983
It does not justify the results of a report in which it says that the White House ’ s efforts to ensure that the media are operating smoothly are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-6.2553
And recent copies cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was adopted .	-3.8499

I should have understood whether I should have 18 that government work could run counter to the political campaigns that preceded it .	-5.3798
Clearly , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-4.7395

And that annoys me most .	-1.7587
I voted Obama back in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.6479
Mitt Romney was a confused and half-baked alternative , he didn ’ t seem to be able to set his direction and positions .	-3.3295
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would meet the hope that we had heard for so long .	-5.7472
But , with the collapse of Obama ’ s inflows to below 45 % this week , this book ’ s return to 2008 has become so tougher .	-4.3914
It gives me the yearning for the many promises that have settled in air .	-3.2023
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to experience a serious loss of Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania .	-4.2609

The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether or not to remove carbon or mining taxes .	-3.8497
But Palmer claimed that only ministers of conflicts of interest could have , and that the daughters of Abbott personally would benefit from the laws .	-3.3781
“ He is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.6569

RBS suspended two foreign exchange traders .	-2.2072
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two merchants from its foreign exchange department , two people familiar with the situation ; this is yet another indication that the world authorities are rapidly taking on the alleged currency market manipulation .	-6.8822
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and RBS , confirmed that they are working with the authorities on the biggest financial market in the world , where US $ 5.3 trillion every day goes .	-6.1095
The two retailers would be the first RBS-employees , who were suspended in the widespread investigation that led to the scandal of the Libor-Interbank business .	-6.3871
The Bank , which did not make a comment on the suspension , confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities .	-3.9317
“ Our inquiries on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-2.9083
Last month , there were people close to the situation that RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former merchant to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Consortium Authority .	-5.7011
This merchant , Richard Usher , had abandoned RBS 2010 and is now to be inspected by JPMorgan from his current position as a European leader of the forecast trade .	-6.5104

Bankers at Barclays and Citigroup were among the Instant Message-Group , saying the situation approaching .	-6.0604
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its staff after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma explained that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the currency market in a number of Swiss banks .	-4.8101
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Agency Weko , the FCA , the US Ministry of Justice and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market .	-4.9771
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said with the situation of familiar persons .	-4.3199
Banks are deluding instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of malfeasance cases .	-4.1759
The news of these investigations has sent traders in an insurgency that has been one of the profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year has been under pressure , because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .	-4.4466
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading retailers believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.5313
A leading dealer pointed out that , despite the huge daily volume in foreign exchange , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the growing use of internal platforms by banks may “ influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-5.5723

It wanted to point to the danger of even greater ruin on the Swiss meadow - one day , the gigantic project should fail .	-7.8674
When talking to many people before the ' construction site ' , it became clear that some citizens believe that the achievement of the city 's project will do much better , although few of the same questions have the same dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-7.2771

Egypt ’ s sworn first freely elected president	-2.2587
Mohamed Morsi sets the presidency , but his day of triumphs will not mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes .	-4.0022
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn in as the country ’ s first freely elected president , and thus the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier .	-5.1966
By appointing the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi was also the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth-largest leader since the monarchy fell about 60 years ago .	-3.9429

“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” Morsi said at the ceremony that was broadcast live on state television .	-3.2658
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an engineer , and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been strongly targeted since its foundation 84 years ago as a prohibited organization by the government .	-6.0008

Only a few hundred supporters had assembled before the court to celebrate the new president , and , unlike the president , Prunk from the Mubarak era , traffic was only held temporarily so that the autoconvoi could normally cross the lively street connecting the city centre with southern suburbs .	-8.2392

advisor is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-3.3450
The Ecumenical Dialogue is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church communities of Salem , the castle of Salem and the cultural community of the Lake Constance region .	-4.4819
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum of the question , as today people perceive the " last things " after death .	-5.3645
Had the people of the past few centuries been aware of this , placing on the pictures of heaven and hell , " which still shape our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic doctrine of the hopes for completion was rather a bit of embarrassment or even nonsense .	-8.6592
" The greater hope has been dismissed by the criticism of religion " , says the referent .	-4.0767
They have given us so many question marks that the exclamations appear to have lost us .	-6.3617
Johanna Rahner continues to say , " But the crucial challenge remains the rim of death " .	-4.5911
This is connected to the question of the desire " which dreams of being good at the end " .	-5.2292

The winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-3.1212
For 21 years , Georges BWave saw how his ill father repeatedly lost consciousness and visited hospitals that had no means to help him .	-5.6266
Jamef BWave was injured in a car accident near Yasdé , the capital of Cameroon .	-3.8657
At first he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation extending to his brain and causing a hemmatom that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.1054
“ There were no neurons in Cameroon , ” says Georges BWave .	-2.7544
We would have released it from Cameroon if we had the money .	-2.6930
Instead , Btwave spent years accompanied his father in filled clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-6.5377
“ It ’ s not easy ” to commented on BWave .	-3.5468
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run the hospital to be the first , and it is not first .	-4.3032
There are many patients .	-1.1409
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.4594
The situation has hardly changed since Bwertes 's father died in 2002 .	-3.3210
There is only one doctor in Cameroon for a number of 5,000 people , so the World Health Organisation .	-3.9414
In contrast , the relationship in the United States is a doctor for 413 people .	-2.6976
But even if there is a doctor for them , most of the Cameroon people could not afford to visit .	-3.1978
Two of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country are private .	-2.7522
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-1.5412
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.8469
His father , and so many of his compatriots , have made the decision to do something about it .	-5.0360
Dr. Georges BWave and its volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year .	-2.6345
He became a doctor himself and works as a surgeon in Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.6028
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOME , which travels to rural areas at weekends and offers free medical services .	-5.3206
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32.000 people .	-2.2647
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people clams into small buses and ride over uncharacteristic terrain with the snowy medical equipment on the roof .	-6.9358
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-1.6374
Already more than once , they had to put the vehicles on the spot through rivers and mud .	-4.1541
But when they arrive they will receive as heroes : a feast dinner , song and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.7825
In these villages , free medical care really is a reason to celebrate and wave – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – is happy to celebrate .	-5.8222
The next morning the team starts studying hundreds of patients .	-2.4629
“ Per trip we handle 500 people ” , says Bwave .	-3.2946
They arrive within a radius of 60 kilometers around the village – and on foot .	-3.3467
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-3.3915
Many people are treated because of malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-9.5478
Other ships get cruisers , donated eyeglasses or free birthplace documents – a document that is required for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-5.4335
In the evening , the team performs simple tasks with a physical anaesthetic .	-4.9268
The operations are usually held in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the surgery the patients are on and go to the rest area to make room for the neighbouring ones .	-7.1302
The illumination for the OP and the disinfection acid base is fed by the group 's generator and thus work Bwave and its volunteers until the early hours of the Sunday .	-5.7861
It is a compact Pensum , but the village musician usually help keep the team motivated .	-3.6532
“ She swings all night so that we can keep awake and continue our work , ” says Bwave .	-3.9283
On Sunday , the team then goes back to the city , tired , but proud of the work that they have done .	-8.2898
The group – a mixture of comic doctors and foreign medical students – has conducted 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people they help .	-5.7720
A man explained that the free operation of a piece of plastic that he has received is now enabling him to work again .	-6.1699
“ That changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.3272
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bshaft also works in private clinics in Yasdé at night .	-5.1043
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , the rest come from private donations .	-4.5541
“ I really don ’ t know when he is sleeping , ” says Katie O ’ Malley , who is studying the Drexel University in Philadelphia and working voluntarily in Bweres Group in the second . , , , and . , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.6707
He is always either hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so that he can go to these campaigns .	-3.8927
For medical and health students such as O 'Malley , coming from the USA and Europe and supporting BWave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never have at home .	-5.5895
“ We can be there for operations where we help to get rid of blood or keep the tools for Dr. BDE , ” O 'Horley explains .	-6.6000
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.0317
The students typically pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and often donated sanitary material .	-4.5996
However , once they are in Yaoundé , Bshaft takes care of accommodation , transport and guidance .	-5.4930
“ He is undoubtedly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.5246
He is dedicated to his life of this organization and his desire to help the Beautiful people know no limits .	-4.5883
The nearly constant labor force is not a burden on the Gulf .	-6.0313
To help others a more happy life , thereby fulfilling a promise that he gave to his father , is a joy to him .	-6.2006
“ I am so happy to do this work , ” says Bwave .	-2.4976
And I am thinking of my father .	-0.9868
I hope he will see what I am doing .	-1.5797
I make it to make people laugh again and to ease the pain .	-2.6511

Uninvited the Battle	-3.9918
The role of the Santiago , the old man in Hemingway " The Old Man and the Sea " , Horst Janis .	-4.7836
Janson is himself an old hare in his Methodier , an art of acting .	-5.1213
The old man Santiago cannot fool you of fishing .	-3.2668
So the two just complement each other great .	-3.8441
It is almost like seeing the wrinkles in the old man ’ s womb , the young fisherman ’ s manolo . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.9665
When Santiago ’ s tired is sitting on the chair , that ’ s true with Janson .	-4.4542
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is by and through a character role that Janson excellently responds .	-5.0478
Heming told the story of a warrior , a brave man who will not stand up and ultimately win the battle against the fish through his knowledge and strength .	-5.5315
Janson is a market leader in the field .	-5.6545
It is designed to focus public attention on itself , so that its monster is not a moment boring .	-6.2382
Its efforts to finally drag the fish to the surface of water are so genuine that viewers forget that the sea is only made of blue lit water bottles .	-4.4346
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man go to the fishing village .	-3.2316
In the course of his performance he puts the active scene into light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie Luise , who , with her songs and her wonderful voice , devoted the sensation of living in Cuba .	-6.5225

Tourism : descent to the Romans	-2.1426
About 120 metres in length , a sewage channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne .	-5.9128
The cathedral is not over .	-4.2367
Around 157 meters the two towers deep into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.7985
The cathedral is worth a visit .	-6.2172
Rainer Schulze is an expert in matters of Cologne Unterwelt .	-1.8743
A meeting place for its guided tours is the service centre of Köln-Tourism on the Cathedral .	-5.4945
The tour starts quite understandably : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-4.9285
In the seventies , the city fathers wanted an automobile city , and that is why the remnants of the old city walls remained just that , which was not too big .	-9.9697
Most of the visitors of the park house therefore rush away from the Roman ruins and leave only their car .	-6.6685
However , if you look more closely , the archaeological finds are discovered in the Parkdeck D2 , separated by material .	-6.6588
There are about five meters high ruins of a hand-rolling stock .	-6.5522
" It is the remnants of the Roman wall built in the second half of the first century in Christ " , says Schulze .	-4.4063
Before the light goes back again , school students can take a look at a dark , 15 meters deep .	-7.2412
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly seen .	-4.8837
Next Station of the Round is the preforator , and here the participants descend into the depth .	-3.7419
We are here to see the office of the once more powerful man north of the Alps , the prefix of the CCAA .	-5.1268
What CCAA means is a visitor .	-2.7498
" The acronym stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippentiium " , which means " in good German as " city of Roman law and town of Agrippineser " , founded by emperor Claudius on the site of the monastery for the Emperor 's cult " .	-8.7377
And the preforator is the former court palace , the power center of the Roman empire on the Rhine .	-3.7324
From the front of the exhibition , a tunnel access leads to the Roman sewerage channel , which has been preserved at approximately 120 metres in length .	-6.1352
" You can walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxma if you want " , if you will " , if you will school the guests .	-6.7865
A surprise still holds school .	-3.3025
After taking the keys at the checkout , he leads the group to a 16 m deep , walk-in shaft .	-6.3548
" We are now at Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.9488
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to come to the ground that was indispensable for the ritual washings .	-4.7405
To this day , at the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels are accessible through changing levels of the Rhine .	-6.7090
Mikwe will be part of a archaeological area on the Town Hall Square , where construction works will begin shortly .	-4.5961
However , it will be several years to complete .	-4.6829

Obama ’ s Health Folly	-2.4966
Following strong criticism yesterday , President Obama made a return on his often repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-4.8798
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of warning , the Republicans accused the president in recent days of misleading the American public .	-5.0245
Yesterday , relative Obama delivered his original promise .	-1.2916
“ The vast majority of the citizens who have a functioning health insurance can keep them ” , he said in a speech in Boston .	-5.1043
In response to the numerous media reports on Kündigung , Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to see themselves in the free market after a new insurance .	-5.0414
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more favourable than anticipated .	-4.2997
“ You come a better offer , ” he said .	-1.6203
The government described it as little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed insurance should look at another rate , because its treaty does not meet the new standards of the Affordable Care Act .	-6.3789
“ I would like to say directly to these Americans : they deserve better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-3.4806
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , stated that the launch of the online platform has been “ abysmal ” since October .	-3.1409
“ I am as frustrated and angry as all others also , ” she said .	-2.3102
I am determined to regain your trust .	-0.8401
Following a dispute with the Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri , she said that she should be required to participate in such care .	-7.2334
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius insisted on repeatedly asking why the “ architects ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily resort to government-funded insurance to settle a price for Cargoe.v , which she now wants to sell millions of Americans .	-6.6718
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian airstrikes .	-2.9343
An American government colleague who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday with the American news broadcaster CNN that Israel ’ s warplanes had attacked an air defense station in Syria ’ s Latiakia a day earlier .	-7.2589
The aim was ' missiles and equipment related to it ' which the Israeli Government feared was that they were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-5.4315
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the port of Latakia had been shot on Thursday overnight , and the Israelis were responsible for it .	-6.6108
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the hub of Latakia , where Russian defense missiles from the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA 3 missiles that have a range of 35 kilometers and can carry up to 70 kg .	-6.1515
Unsure the Jerusalem Government has not officially confirmed the attack .	-5.7287
However , the Reuters news agency quoted an equally anonymous Israeli government official in the words that he believes Israel has carried out the attack , but not certain .	-5.6501
In any case , a Speaker of the Israeli Defense Department said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-4.0387
The Ron Ben-Yishai journalist emphasized in the daily Yedith Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already succeeded , partly , in trying to supply base base missiles to Hezbollah .	-6.7442
The Israeli government repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would involve exceeding a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-3.7457
John Kerry , in an unprecedented admission that the US spy went “ inappropriate . ”	-3.0677
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , hinted at the US ’ s confrontational stance on its surveillance programs by saying that espionage was “ inappropriate too far ” in certain cases .	-6.1634
The Foreign Minister also said that he was shaking responsibility with Barack Obama for putting the autopilot on a public record when the scathing revelations of the Whisstalive Edward Snowden were published about the spy activities of the NSA .	-8.9417
The leaked information has brought the US government into a diplomatic frenzy of indignation by its allies .	-3.9010
In a video interview at the London Open Governent Conference , Kerry said : “ The President and I , and others in the government , have learned of some things that have virtually ended up with an autopilot , simply because the ability to do so was to go back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War , and of course to September 11 . ”	-9.1804
Then , as the first high-level member of the US government , he admitted that the US spy had crossed a border , but also emphasized that no rights were abused .	-4.5197
He said : “ In some cases , that was inappropriate . ”	-2.6822
The President is determined to establish clarity , and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one must feel the same , there are abuses here .	-6.4763
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-1.3682
Kerry , however , insisted that the NSA be a force of good and that many lives were saved through its monitoring operations .	-3.9655
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world where people are prepared to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.6071
There is a radical extremism in the world that is eating to kill people , blow up and attack governments .	-3.1591
So what if we were able to catch and stop it before it happens ?	-3.0000
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes , buildings and the murder of people because we have learned about such plans .	-4.8991
Meanwhile , US lawmakers will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about the alleged American spy and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US , as the chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs stated on Thursday .	-5.0093
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other people and is concerned about their threats to stop taking part in anti-terror organisations because of the frustration with the National Security Agency .	-5.7513
" It is very important for the national security interests of the US that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism , " said Murphy , who is a Democrat in the Senate for the first time and is acting as chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-8.9839
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes .	-3.8734
Media reports that the NSA gathered millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , even though the head of the intelligence service stated this week that the reports were inaccurate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato allies and had been exchanged with the United States .	-5.9342
Other revelations cited from Snow ’ s continued documents that the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world heads of state .	-4.8535
The head of the national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared that this is common on both sides .	-4.3744
In all the turmoil , Murphy said that his authority was preparing the trip of the Congress to take place this year and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers .	-6.1725
The names of other Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.7646
He said that the exact route is still under way .	-3.2151
While Murphy emphasized that the aim of the journey is to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.1699
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programs that they have used for years .	-3.9396
" While we can change our surveillance programs and thus better protect the rights of Europeans , they also have to accept the fact that we are not the only ones that spy , " said Murphy .	-4.9047
Meanwhile , John Kerry is on the weekend a journey to the Middle East and to Poland to deal with the resentment about the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .	-4.9781

Australian secretary appealed against imprisonment in Thailand .	-4.0616
A 21-year old woman from Sydney , who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket because he wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver , has appealed against the ruling and released on bail .	-4.9325
Stevie Rochele Bamford was initially found guilty of a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false statement after she told the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped them in the morning of Sunday , 10 June , while two other men kept them fixed .	-7.4495
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had arrived safely in her hotel after she had been separated by her Australian friend .	-5.2714
The police in Phuket have been serving Bamford for two days until they have come up with history .	-4.7085
Until the trial , they found themselves in police custody .	-8.1357
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-level detention institution on the border of Phukets , instead of a prison for adult women .	-4.6218
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Ruby league , who addressed the State Department in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter .	-4.0138
The Sunday Telegraph in Sydney declared that the whole family was “ extremely worried ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-5.2587
“ Of course , we are very concerned , but we hope that it will be back at home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-4.4411
Bamford has appealed against the ruling and is at walking distance from 50,000 Baht .	-4.7629
In Australian reports , she was able to read that she is making a holiday in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand .	-5.7170
The court ’ s spokesman was told that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-4.2436
However , it is also possible that , after the recent assassination of the travel woman Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand might be tempted to improve its celebrated tourist image , and it is therefore a statement .	-8.1279
