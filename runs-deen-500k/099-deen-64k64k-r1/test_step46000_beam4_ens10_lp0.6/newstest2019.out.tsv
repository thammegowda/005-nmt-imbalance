He said that , because of unemployment and lack of educational opportunities , young people are caught in criminal gangs .	-3.3443
US should double Artificial intelligence spending .	-2.7442
While China is more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investments , says Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI-practitioner working for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-4.2927
These demands were made after US officials announced that they were AI , despite the lack of a formal AI strategy .	-6.2961
China has now presented its plan last year : by 2030 it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-3.2575
“ The doubling of spending on AI research would be a good start in view of the fact that all other countries lag far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is short before , ” said Lee .	-5.6245
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence is achieved in the US , said Lee CNBC in an interview this week . the of , , , , , , , and , , , , , ,	-6.7259
Lee , whose book “ AI supermasters : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the new world order ) ” has been published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of SinovVentures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese companies , Facebook + , .	-10.6365
In the 1980s , he worked at the Carnegie Mellon University on a KI system that defeated the highest ranked American Otlight players .	-5.2031
Lee has recognized the previous US government technology competition such as robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Agency ) and asked when the next one would take place to identify the next donors .	-4.7890
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain state subsidies , ” Lee said .	-2.6316
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , ” Lee noted .	-3.4449
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have set up university coryparies in recent years to work on AI .	-4.8286
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US intensify its AI efforts .	-2.9376
“ I think Green Cards should be offered automatically to doctors in AI , ” he said .	-2.9261
In July 2017 , the Chinese State Council presented its next generation ’ s artificial intelligence plan ( Next Generation artificial intelligence development plan ) .	-3.8384
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-3.5393
At the beginning of this year , the US Department of Defense has established a Joint Artistic Intelligence Center , which is intended to include partners from industry and science , and the White House has announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-5.6416
And this month DARPA has announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an initiative called “ AI Next ” .	-2.0286

Macedonia is voting in a referendum on whether the country 's name should be changed .	-2.2580
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed in ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece that blocked its accession arrangements for the European Union and NATO .	-4.6564
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim on the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.9214
In June , the two governments concluded an agreement on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population .	-3.5616
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he will not vote in the referendum , and , in view of a boycott campaign , there is a doubt that the result will create the 50-percentage barrier , which is a prerequisite for the referendum ’ s validity .	-6.8086
The question on the ballot box was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-3.2944
Advocates of the change in name , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing to include institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.0253
“ I came today to vote on the future of the country , and it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the roof of the European Union , for that means a life in greater security for us , ” said Olivera Georgiska , 79 , in Skopje .	-5.9504
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will adhere to the outcome of the vote so that it becomes crucial .	-3.9062
A two-thirds majority in Parliament will be required for the change in name .	-3.7882
The country voting committee said at 13 p.m. that irregularities were not reported .	-4.8437
But turnout was only 16 % – 34 % in the last parliamentary election in 2016 , and 66 % of the registered electorate voted in the end .	-10.8446
“ I went for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a electorate in the capital of Skopje .	-3.7327
Macedonia 's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son , Dushko , have cast their vote in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country 's name , which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , 30 September 2018 .	-4.6363
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents that were set up by those who boycott the referendum .	-3.9151
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads in the top , not through the door " , said Kavadarkov .	-3.9856
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.9023
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in the Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.8179
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.5194
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” said Zaev after his vote .	-3.6061
According to him , the result would be ‘ yes ’ to ‘ affirmation of our future ’ .	-3.8551
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-3.3032
Another survey carried out by Macedonian Telma TV showed that 57 percent of the respondents were to cast their vote on Sunday .	-5.0120
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said they would vote ‘ yes ’ .	-3.8937
The referendum will only be accepted if the turnout is more than 50 % .	-3.4527
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policies since its adoption in May last year .	-2.6492

Then Agüero looked surrounded by three green themes .	-2.1139
He went down a defender before he was leaving several players on the sidelines of the Brighton penal space .	-6.3483
Then he left a pass and returned to death .	-2.7743
The English people used his first contact to play back the ball at Agüero , who then shoot with the right – past Brighton-Tory writer Mathew Ryan to the right side of the Tors .	-5.8681
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said manager Pep Guardila the reporter .	-3.9395
“ We spoke about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-1.9338

Scherzer wants to play toys against rockies .	-2.4583
Because the national character was excluded from the Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-4.3914
But the hart converted Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still Playoff-effects for the Rockies that have a lead from a game before Los Angeles Dodgers in the West NL .	-6.0306
The Rockies , with a 5 : 2 victory over the national race on Friday evening , secured at least a lead , but the winning title in the first league is still not certain .	-6.3847
" Even if we play for free , we can at least do something because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver , with the people and the other team will probably be the best that we can offer this year .	-4.6132
Why do I not want to make any efforts ? '	-4.7703
The national has not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are reportedly inclined to throw Mr Scherzer in such a situation .	-4.7540

The Labour Party is no longer a vast community .	-1.3971
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.8171
As a snapshot of my local party voted to criticize me , it was hardly a surprise .	-3.0785
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour Members who say that we are not welcome - only because we said our opinion .	-3.7993

The news for East Labour in Nottingham meeting on Friday says : ' We want meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-3.9214
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meeting was exactly the same on Friday evening .	-9.0410
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , gentler ' policy is long forgotten if it ever started .	-5.0017
It has become increasingly clear that different views on the Labour Party are not tolerated , and any opinion will be judged on whether it is acceptable for party leadership .	-4.4381
This started shortly after Mr Jeremys took office , because my colleagues with whom I had previously thought that I would have a similar political attitude expected me to pursue a U-turn and adopt positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with , be it on national security or the EU internal market .	-7.7558
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a wave of abuse in the social media that calls for rejection , denounce the Centre ’ s policy and tell me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-6.1011
This experience has not only I made .	-3.4399
I do know , in fact , that more luck than some of my colleagues , as the comments that are directed towards me tend to be political .	-5.2060
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are subjected every day to a flood of sex or racial abuse , but never shy away .	-4.3391
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the level of abuse has normalized .	-2.2427
Jeremy Corbyn asserted last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.8829
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and the party will be smaller with any motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules .	-3.9838
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to collect my neck , not to be so vocal , and then I would be “ in order . ”	-4.3125
But for this reason I have not come into politics .	-2.4334
32 years ago , I joined me as a student who was neglecting the Thatcherite government , Labour , who had neglected my class room literally collapsed , so I tried to use better public services for those who need it most , whether it be a municipal council or ministers .	-8.8325
I have never hidden my political views , even at the last election .	-2.4805
As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody in Nottingham 's East should have been confused in any way ; the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.0187
I would just like to say to those who supported Friday 's motion that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party if the country is heading towards a Brexit that is detrimental to households , businesses and our public services .	-5.3137
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham ’ s moment , but about my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that no threats to choosing or political opportunism will prevent me from working in what I think is the best interest of you all .	-5.6174

Robyn Christie of Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have used their chances better . ”	-3.5749
In contrast , Grant ’ s attempt to complete the 14th minute by Frats Climo brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of the Warrior , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot a non-related attempt .	-9.2136
Climo extended Ayr ’ s lead with a crash before he reached a halfway match and then made a solo attempt with which he managed to tour the 17 : 5 silence for Ayr .	-7.7783
Melrose , however , began the second half good , and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform baggot reduced the backlog to five points .	-4.8649
After the reboot , Ayr started out as a relief from director McDowall-of Climo .	-7.6571
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and then went back to Melrose to pay the extra man with an not converted Bruce Colvine try to stop pressing .	-7.5091

Throughout the entire Bolivia , memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive - just as the yearning to return to the Pacific .	-4.9627
These hopes may have been at their maximum for decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussions .	-4.7384
" Bolivia has the dynamic , the spirit of unity and tranquility , and naturally , with a positive view , awaits the result " , said Roberto Calzveila , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.7658
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country , and hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will find the claim of Bolivia for priority , that Chile must negotiate after decades of undignified talks to grant Bolivia a sovereign access to the sea .	-5.9385
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic independent president – who faces a disputed battle for re-election next year – it also depends very much on Monday ’ s decision .	-4.1532
“ We are about to get access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he vowed at the end of August .	-2.8374
However , some analysts believe that it will be unlikely for Bolivia to decide , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about a change .	-5.3665
The Dutch UN institution has no power to give birth to God 's territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-5.1004
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was " not complicated " , said Paz , a terrorist expert in international law .	-5.7590

Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally , YouTube Channel	-1.5922
President Donald Trump begins this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.9801
His tour includes the Republican states of Tennessee and Mississippi .	-5.3905
While his candidate ’ s confirmation for the vacant post on the Supreme Court remains pending , Trump must mobilize his constituents for the upcoming midterm elections , because otherwise there is a fear that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-6.0412
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally this evening and how do you watch it online ?	-2.6059
Trump ’ s Drive in Wheeling , West Virginia is scheduled for 19 : ET this evening , Saturday 29 September 2018 .	-4.0669
You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online via live stream to YouTube .	-2.6273
Trump will certainly refer to the hearings that took place this week on charges of sexual abuse against his candidates for the Supreme Court , Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office that the Senate must take place has been postponed by at least one week until the FBI exam was completed .	-6.3638
But the main objective of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans with a decisive election in November .	-3.6197
According to Reuters , the Trump campaign ’ s aim is to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week with the five electoral events to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House .	-3.9516
“ The majority in Congress is on the agenda of the President , so he is visiting as many states just before the start of the turbulent campaign season , ” a Trump campaign spokesman who does not want to be called , “ Reunion . ”	-6.3531
According to the West Virginia Metro News Radionet , the electoral event taking place in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could appeal to supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract attention to the child 's vital media .	-6.8001
On Saturday Trump will visit the second time this month , the state he earned more than 40 % in 2016 .	-4.3300
Trump is trying to help the Republican Senate candidate of West Virginia , Patrick Morrisey , who is lagging behind in the polls .	-2.7302
According to Reuters , Simon Haines , Politburo , at the University of West Virginia , said that it was not a good sign of Morrisey that the president had to come to improve his poll values .	-4.6724
Ryder Cup 2018 : The team USA is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday ’ s ingles .	-3.1395
After three one-sided meetings , four players on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-4.3556
The oscillating pendulum is a freely sound sports concept that the player has unleashed , especially in competitions like them .	-3.8952
So where would they say is the momentum now ?	-1.8877
“ You had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so there is a bit of swing , ” said Jordan when he was going back for the day . ”	-6.3133
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of 4 points in the lead to twelve more playing .	-5.4247
But Americans , as Spith says , feel a little wind in their sails and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spith and Justin Thomas , who played the whole day together , and each with three points of four .	-6.0437
Spith was superior from the outset and set a good example .	-4.0934
These twinks were louder than his round , he drove up a decisive Put to reach a decision in play 4 after he and Thomas return to 2 points .	-7.2568
His joy with the Put on the 15th hole , with which she won the game , was such that he thought he still had the victory of the Americans .	-5.0608
" You really have to concentrate and just worry about your own game , " Spith said .	-3.6014
This is also all that remains of any of these players .	-5.1004
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.2460
At this Ryder Cup in the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spith and Thomas .	-4.3519
Europe 's strange , but admirable couple plays mistakes and simply does everything right .	-4.2679
" Molmitood " was the only pair that didn 't reach a Bogey on Saturday afternoon , but it also avoided at Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning the rear nine .	-6.3149
This race , and the way in which their energy appears to flow and from this dodgy amount , makes them the favourite on Sunday and when the sun goes over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular players who seal a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinoari .	-7.8495
Probably both at different holes .	-2.7720
Speaking of a European victory would be too premature .	-2.5806
Buba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Norte in the morning .	-3.4475
With a Bogey and two Doubles to the first nine grues of the Spaniards and the Swede enter a hole from which they never came out again .	-6.1083
On Sunday , however , there is no one helping you out of your hole .	-2.8440
Because of the interactions between the couple , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in the square , it is very fascinating to know Fourball and Fourwards close by .	-7.7581
Europe has played a better role as a team and has taken over a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome-seat has also shown that the team has the desire to fight something that some , especially those of us , have questioned .	-8.1195
Europe is holding 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.7338
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from the four- and four- games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-5.2603
The inspiration Tomy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its previous record in the Le Golf National to four points .	-5.1398
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who had lost them two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated the American team fighting for extinction , and won the series with 3-1 .	-6.0792
The US offered more resistance in four and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-2.1774
Jim Furyk ’ s team needs eight points from the 12 individual games from Sunday to keep the trophy .	-4.4554
Fleurwood is the first European Rookie , which wins four points in consequence , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliad " , are only the second pair that wins four points from their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cups .	-6.4050
After crushing Woods and Patrick Reed in Fourball , it was certain that they would strike a gruesome Woods and the American Rookie Bryson Dechamau through an even more clearly 5 & 4 .	-7.2185
Woods , who sustained two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has lost 19 of his 29 games in four instances and four and seven as a result .	-6.7841
Justin Rose , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the fours and beat in a 2 & 1-defeat DubeaJohnson and Brooks Koepka – one place and three in the world .	-5.7440
In a pleasant , airy day south-west of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-3.6321
The three main company Jordan Province and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-4.9962
They won a bold 2 : 1-victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulin Viererack , and later returned to beat Poulter and Roory McIlen 4 : 3 in the four-erack after losing the first two holes .	-6.9912
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story will a team return from a four-point deficit to the singles , although holder Furyk 's side only needs a decision to keep the trophy .	-5.0074
After two days of the second consecutive period , however , a Sunday counter looks as though it would go beyond it .	-4.2592
North Korea says that “ there will be no ” unilateral disarmament without trust	-3.6968
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continuing sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States and that , in no case , the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.7987
Ri Yong Ho , the annual General Assembly of the World Body , said that North Korea last year took " important goodwill measures " , such as halting nuclear and missile tests , dismantling the nuclear test grounds , and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-7.3151
" But there is no corresponding answer from the US , " he said .	-2.6949
“ Without any trust in the US , there will be no trust in our national security , and in such circumstances there will be no possibility of unilateral disarmament . ”	-4.4144
While Ri revived the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to de-denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarding gradually , his explanation seemed significant insofar as it did not fully reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang has done in the past .	-6.7522
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to working toward “ decoupling the Korean Peninsula , ” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-5.5032
North Korea has sought a formal end of the Korean war 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons .	-2.5339
Washington also resisted the calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.4774
The US insists on " denuclearization first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure from sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , even rejecting the " declaration of war " , said Ri .	-5.1288
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to the knees is a dream dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-2.7180
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust . ”	-2.2878
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.7223
Instead , the Minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in the last five months and added : ' If the party on this issue of de-nuclear non-proliferation in South Korea and not the US , the elimination of the Korean Peninsula would not be a dead end ' .	-7.1194
Yet the audio of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported to the U.N. General Assembly , targeting the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evo ’ s president , ” Trump , a “ Rocketmann , ” referred to a suicide mission .	-7.6351
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ destroy ” North Korea last year , has commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work has yet to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-5.5689
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a time limit and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.4691
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.5206
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , the UN Security Council said on Thursday that ' enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be pursued vigorously and without failure until we implement the complete , final and verification authorisation . '	-6.4166
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programs .	-3.1902
Pompeo met on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.1976
Pompeo has already visited North Korea this year three times , but his last trip was not good .	-2.8720
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress was made , and only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him “ similar demands . ”	-3.4444
North Korea has promised this month that a meeting with Moon will dismantle a missile base and a nuclear complex if the United States adopt ' appropriate measures ' .	-5.8873
He said that Kim said to him that the ' appropriate measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore and steps to normalise relations with Washington .	-3.7285
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough rest .	-1.7844
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing potential culture of study of " mixed nights " .	-3.4131
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often stunned when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.5497
Charles Cline , professor of sleepcare at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the US .	-4.6020
He was inspired to start the course after holding a lecture on the impact of lack of sleep on learning .	-3.1160
At the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this not the first time in my final year ?	-5.1316
She said that she never told someone of the meaning of the sleep – which surprised me " , he told the fax .	-4.6823
The course that is offered this year for the first time will explain to students the basics of how good sleep habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their overall wellbeing .	-4.3052
Paul Barireira , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and managing director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the university had decided to set the course after she found that the students had been extremely low during the week .	-5.4531
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.2587
In a section there is an image of a sleep , where students click on coffee , antrests , trainers and books to be informed of the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance affects the lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeptime routine .	-7.2062
In another section , participants will explain how long-term sleeplessness can raise the risk of heart failure , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-4.5736
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect their daily lives .	-2.1072
We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately .	-1.8659
" But we believe that she has a right to know - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " , Prof. Czyssler adds .	-5.6204
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students make sleeping a growing problem .	-3.3455
Enough of good quality sleep , the ' secret weapon ' should be a student to fight stress , fatigue and fear , he said - even to avoid falling , because sleepless the brain is riding in hunger mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-8.5443
Raymond Thus , a 19-year-old California graduate of chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Cclasler shape the course after he visited one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-4.7696
He said that the course had opened his eyes and led him to push for a camp wide course .	-4.3597
The next step , he hopes , is to call upon all Dokotorpa members to complete a similar study programme before entry into the Competition School .	-6.3086
Prof. CX recommended the students to raise an alarm when they go into bed and when they should wake up and be aware of the damaging effects of the " blue light " that is broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can cause their circumnavigate rhythm to the clock , resulting in problems when sleeping .	-8.6536
Livigno 1-0 Rangers : Menas Godal eret Gerrads men .	-4.7767
Further rise problems of the Rangers : After a hit of Dolly Menga , it came to 1-to-0-defeat in Livrton for the unsome team of Steven Gerrard .	-6.2814
The Irox team wanted to record their first victory since February 4 : 1-triumph in St. John , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerry 's second defeat in 18 games as a trainer who left his team eight points behind the disappointing Ladbrokes Premier Hearts .	-6.9920
Menga ended seven minutes before the half-time time a match and an inspiring Rangersion couldn ’ t be seen as if it could bring about a balance .	-9.6865
As the Rangers now falls back to the sixth place , Livmington climb to rank three and only because of the torque difference behind Hibernian .	-6.1953
New difficulties for the Rangers are emerging , as a head cut had to be supplied to scheduled judges Calum Spence after being hit by a cast item – appear to be thrown out of the scene of forward fans .	-7.8225
Gerrard made eight changes to the page passing by Ayr and cast directly into the semi-finals of the Bet Cup .	-3.5817
On the other hand , Holt presented the same Livi-Elf , which had taken a step last week from Hearts , and he may have been amazed how his well-trained team left no room for action for the opponents at any time .	-8.2121
However , the Rangers dominated the amount of ball , and Livpacked ’ s chances were better off .	-7.2838
They should have met after only two minutes , when Mengas first hand hand Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregory Tor , but the middle field player late his big change .	-7.4793
A deeper fanfare from Keaghan Jacobs then went to captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far in the direction of upstream posts .	-4.5993
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than to give away in their own game , last third .	-5.7468
Before the start of the first quarter of the year , Alfredo Morelos was clearly of the opinion that he had to pay an penalty penalty after he and Steven Lawless had clashed , but Judge Steven Thomson did not insist on the appeals of the Colombians .	-9.8914
The Rangers has only two shots in the first half , but the former Irox-Torist Lion Kelly was hardly influenced by Lassana 's couching jump and the match of a bisheaded Ovie Ejaria .	-9.4945
Although Livis ’ s opening hit may have been in the 34th minute , no one can deny that they have earned it for their efforts alone .	-5.4989
Again , the Rangers failed to master a Jacobean state .	-3.4171
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher Robinson caught the ball that kept quiet and named Menga for a simple finish .	-4.4009
Gerrard was at the break when he was couced against Kent Ryan and the change immediately had a chance to play when the wings played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly expanded from his line to block .	-7.5708
But Livigno always drew the guests to play exactly the type of game they like , with Lithgouw and Halkett after long balls long gone by .	-5.3042
Holts team could have completed their lead in the closing phase , but McGregor was well up to deny Jacobs before leaving Lithgow from the corner .	-5.6167
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim for a penalty , because he was hiding with Jacobs , but once again he saw Thomson lost .	-6.8903
Almins : The inventor of the Geiger Counter	-3.3595
And now one page from our Almontag “ Sunday morning ” : September 30th , 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... the day when the future physicist John Wilhelm , named Hans , Geiger , was born in Germany .	-5.9189
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that finally produced the device known as the Geiger .	-4.7379
Since then , Geigermeter has become a mainstream of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Corvonado " , which appears to be unlikely cowboy scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-6.8259
Mann : " What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.7225
Rogers : “ It is a violin counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.4635
When you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity into the minerals . ”	-3.2943
Evans : “ Say you , but now it is big ! ”	-4.1319
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63 birthday .	-1.6515
But the invention that bears its name is still used .	-2.4165
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-2.6372
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-2.8204
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify vicious cells as part of the treatment .	-2.5805
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of this within the laboratory .	-3.2527
They can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer , and then they are again susceptible to injuries .	-5.2622
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-2.6746
A woman who has been treated with the vaccine , which helps the immune system detect rogue cells , has seen her egg cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-4.6644
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient to modify it in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many cancer species , and then the cells are again being injected .	-6.2528
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethlehem , Maryland said : " Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-2.9995
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different types of cancer , including breast , egg , lung and intestinal cancer , said Prof. Berzofsky .	-2.9271
A similar approach to identifying patients with immune cells and teaching them how to kill cancer cells has worked in treating a type of leukemia .	-4.2584

According to the information published , American Senator Lindsey Graham ’ s private addresses and telephone numbers were published from South Carolina , and the US Senator Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both of them from Utah .	-5.7086
The information published on Thursday online , posted by an unknown person on the Capitol Toilet during a hearing of the Senate about the allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh .	-6.0531
The data of the three senators were released shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-2.6451
conservative Web sites such as gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified by the source of the sites was connected to Waterman 's office and reported the information of a person from Waterman .	-5.8611
“ This untruth is completely wrong and an absolute lie , so Waters continued .	-4.2910
“ The employees of my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – were in no way responsible for the information being collected .	-6.3912
This irresponsible claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.4741
Waters statement quickly led to criticism online , including the former White House Press secretary , Ari Meer .	-4.8240
“ The fact that the matter is debnet is extremely annoying ” , wrote butlers .	-5.2504
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a member of the Congress .	-2.9474
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.4306
They must not be allowed to sit down .	-2.2787
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-1.7824
They must be calm and quiet . ”	-2.4017
Meat seemed to compare Waterman 's reaction with the criticism of the democrats to Judge Kavanaugh , accused of being angry by critics during the hearing on Thursday .	-4.3585
Similarly , Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ran in the interim elections next to her seat , expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-5.3682
„ Big , if true “ , he did getweet .	-2.5914
In its statement , Waters said that their office " informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about fraudulent claims .	-3.3824
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are taken and their actions , which are destructive and dangerous to my employees , ” they continued .	-4.6641
Review by " Johnny English - You live only three times " – poor casters with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.4884
It is a tradition to seek Brexit in any new film with a British trend , and that seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-hudy-of-war , which began in 2003 with , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , ,	-9.1634
Is the ironic self-satire on the brink of humanity the new opportunity for the nation to export ?	-4.6566
In any case , the bell-like , fuzzy and incompetent Johnny English won the second licenses to reshape things again , and its name shows wonderful that it is a comic creation with great reach that was designed for non-English cinema visitors .	-9.6266
He is of course the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims of smoothie gladiality , has received a bit of manual , a syrup Mr. Beam and a tracker from this guy , and who has contributed a single note to the guiding melody of the firefighters at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-9.5526
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once cooperated in the now forgotten Barclayvers television , always masks chaos .	-6.2097
There is one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny England pot .	-2.8861
I loved Johnny English , who is approaching a helicopter in a medieval armor , and the main rotor is attacking his helmet shortly .	-5.3572
Atkinson 's talent for body tissue is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and somewhat superfluous , especially since the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission impossible comedy self-assured .	-4.8940
The humour felt like he was directed at children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misadventures of Johnny English are not so imaginative and focused as Atson 's portrait films .	-6.9244
The everlasting premise is now that Britain is in great difficulty .	-3.0947
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on site , to the horror of service agents – an unfortunate small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.0814
It is the last straw for a prime minister who has been a brave and courageous personality and who has already suffered a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .	-6.6530
Their intelligence consultants inform them that , as each individual active spy has been compromised , it has to take someone out of retirement .	-5.6315
And this means that the rabble Johnny English himself , who is currently employed as a master in an noble body , but gives unparalleled lessons about how to act as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of rock academy about espionage .	-7.9558
English was brought back to Whitehall after an emergency war and reunited with his former long-worn Kumpel Bough , once again played by Ben Miller .	-5.3437
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overtired , burschism role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully respected .	-6.1548
So , the Batman and Robin of the Chaos with the Secret Service of Her Majesty are again in action and meet at Olga Kurylos beautiful Fehen Fatal Oppilla .	-5.7129
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously entranced by the charismatic tech billionaires who claim to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.4602
English and Bough began their Odyssey of colorful Highjings : When kiddies , they ignited a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas luxury ybeight ; and English is dissolved from pure anarchy , as he tries to familiarise himself with a Virtual Reality headset with the inside of Voltas house .	-8.7052
For these last sequences all the records have been made , but they are so amiable and unmissed , the whole thing is reminiscent of child service .	-8.8382
That is the right thing to do .	-3.0019
And , as with the other Johnny England movies , I could not fail to think : can the British film industry , Rowan Atkinson , not have a role to play in his talent ?	-5.7235
Labour has denied having developed a plan for British for a four-day week , for which five days are paid .	-4.2680
Jeremy Corbyns ’ Labour tests a radical plan in which British work only four days a week , but paid for five .	-3.8272
According to reports , the party wants to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them an extra day .	-3.5873
Staff would enjoy a weekend in Berlin - but would still make the same money home .	-6.2815
Sources said that the idea would be ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and is planning to tilt the country in favour of workers .	-4.8123
The Trade Union Congress approved the conversion to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to benefit from the changing economy .	-4.7285
The Sunday Times said a high level source of Labour : a review of politics is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-5.9789
A fourth day week is a goal that is consistent with the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance for workers and the general industrial strategy of the party , but this objective will not be realistic overnight .	-5.6983
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a fourth working week during its campaign in 2017 .	-2.9868
However , the whole Labour Party does not support this attempt at the moment .	-4.3667
One speaker from the Labour Party said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-3.8008
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to clarify his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.0327
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of " faceless directors " and " profits " at service companies .	-3.7827
The plans of the Shadow Chancellor also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not get their whole share back , because an Labour Government could " withdraw " due to alleged misconduct .	-6.5036
He also endorsed the plans of workers to transfer services and to create inclusive ownership funds in order to distribute 10 % of the private sector ’ s capital assets to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.8754
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 Minutes ” about whether the FBI investigation against Kavanugh could change their mind .	-4.1611
Following an ongoing FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Vollard Kavanaugh , the final vote on the appeal of the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week , and the question raised whether the investigations results of the FBI Republican Senators might lead to give up their support for cavanugh .	-7.6867
In an interview broadcast on Sunday , Scott Peley , correspondent of “ 60 Minutes , ” Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could move them to change their opinion .	-4.9583
Kennedy appeared as his colleague from South Carolina .	-3.6040
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.0892
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke with Judge Kavanaugh .	-2.3365
I called him after that happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Did you do it ? '	-7.2320
He was determined , targeted , unequivocal . '	-2.5220
Graham 's vote seemed to be in stone .	-2.3152
" I have a view on Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb , " he said .	-2.4462
“ Dr. Ford , I do not know what has happened , but I know that board has strongly denied the accusation , ” Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-5.4108
" No one they called could confirm .	-2.6970

" What is the Global Cities Festival and has ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-2.2532
On this Saturday , the Global Cities Festival takes place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.5994
The seventh year ’ s Global Cities Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Card B and Shawn Mender , but also to draw attention to the real goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-5.6136
The Global Cities Festival , held in 2012 , is an extension of Global Poverty Projects , an international interest group aimed at fighting poverty by increasing the number of people who actively oppose it .	-4.3755
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as voluntary work , an email to a world leader , a telephone call or another useful opportunity to raise the objective of combating poverty and increase awareness of it .	-6.2701
But how successful has Global Cities been to achieve its goal with 12 remaining years ?	-3.2181
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real opportunity to convince people to call for action , or just another case of the so-called ' clickism ' - people who feel to be sent a Tweet by signing an online petition or by sending an online request , as if they make a real difference ?	-6.2437
Global Cities say that , since 2011 , more than 19 million “ actions ” have been recorded by its supporters , pushing for a variety of objectives .	-4.0404
It is said that these actions have motivated global leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.6864
In early 2018 , the group implemented 390 operations and announcements of its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion was already disbursed or financed .	-4.1003
The group estimates that the funds provided so far had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-4.9665
Among the most important commitments , The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations , which has committed themselves to “ helping children to develop their full potential ” , has promised to support Rwanda with $ 35 million in ending malnutrition in the country after Global citizens have received more than 4.700 tweets .	-6.8903
“ With support from the British government , donors , other state governments , and global citizens like you , we can make the social injustice of one day ’ s malnutrition a story , ” said The Power of Nuetador Tracey Ullman of the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-6.8256
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the UK , which sought to improve maternal and child nutrition , the government will achieve the financing of the " Power of Nutrition " project of 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-5.0660
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website : “ Why do you think that we can put an end to extreme poverty ? ? ? ”	-3.4574
Globalist citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-3.9112
Like the large civil law and the anti-apartheid movements , we will succeed because we are more powerful together .	-3.8252
The stars Janet Jackson , Weknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardinal B and Janelle Monáe will be present at this year ’ s event in New York , hosted by Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-6.4129

Washington may “ if necessary ” recourse to his Marine to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets , even in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan ’ s advice of the Washington Examination is cited .	-6.1102
Zike claimed that Russia ’ s commitment to Syria – especially in the case of activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-4.3369
“ I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is this : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.7778

Zike spoke to the participants of an event of Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that describes itself as the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.6164
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran , and found that they are actually the same .	-2.9129
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a ' one-Trick Pony ' economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-3.0574
The opinions come , while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe , and to replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-4.6050
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are thus trying to push Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” North Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ torn ” Moscow .	-14.1496
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is to double the existing pipe capacity to 110 billion cubic meters , is a purely economic project .	-3.5583
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.5887
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.5539

One week after an official Chinese newspaper issued a four-page display in a US newspaper on the mutual benefits of the US China trade , the US ambassador in Beijing suggested using the American press to spread propaganda .	-5.5633
U.S. President Donald Trump pointed out on Wednesday that China Daily was paid in the Moines Register - the state with the most widely sold Iowa newspaper - after he accused China to intervene in the US Congress elections of November 6 , which China disputes .	-7.3263
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of intervening in US elections was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-3.0745
While it is normal for foreign states to turn ads to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.6517
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs were supposed to hit Chinese and US experts by exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-4.1405
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China and former long-time governor of Iowa , an important exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing had hurt American workers , farmers and businesses .	-3.8813
China , in an article of opinion in the Moines Register on Sunday , “ this bullying is now carrying out propaganda in our own free press .	-5.5704
“ The spread of propaganda as a paid display in the Moines Register makes use of China ’ s government ’ s estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and freedom of the press , ” Branstad wrote .	-4.0868
" By contrast , you will find only limited voices at the newspaper level in the Beijing streets and see no real rebuttal of different views that the Chinese people may have about China ’ s disturbing economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-6.6764

The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said that they want to vote for him .	-2.9209
These things cannot be traced , Grant Reef , professor of political science at the Maxwell School of the Syrace University , published on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-3.9246
She said that , at the last minute , support from Jeff Flake ( Republican Member for the Federal State of Arizona ) was sufficient for an investigation by the FBI to reconcile the president .	-7.1924

“ The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalists .	-1.9932
“ People say that it is already well advanced , that is true .	-3.8294
But the figure could be higher , especially in the selection candidates in pre-cities and younger voters , 18- to 29-year-olds who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-6.3325
Already before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she told her allegations of sexual violence against the candidate for the Supreme Court , analysts suggest that a backlash might follow if Republicans turn the way .	-6.5479
“ For the GOP , this has become a wooly mess , ” said Michael Steele , former leader of the Republican National Committee , early last week , according to NBC News .	-3.5449

A fan on Twitter described the change to a child cartoon as a " some sick joke " .	-4.0834

“ But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday there and we will be able to fix it only on Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-4.1250

Believe me when it was switched , a lot was written and the contents were all not friendly .	-4.0692
We tried to repair it , we thought it would be a technical error .	-1.0513
But that was not ; it was a government problem .	-1.9492
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-1.6814
We will reduce it to five rather than six fights - as we normally do - and we have tried to exceed the fans and have simply gone over .	-4.2829
It is an unfavourable situation . '	-1.9639
Anthony Island Discos : Tom Daley felt his sexuality less important .	-3.6788
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling that he was all inferior because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-4.0385
The 24-year-old said that he became aware only at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-4.1329
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 , Lauren Laverne said he publicly spoke about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope ” .	-4.2588
He also said that victory at the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.6429
The regular hosts of the long-running show , Kristy Young , released several months due to a disease .	-4.6084
Daley joined Lavernes ’ first program and said that he felt as a woman ’ s growing “ less value ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-5.5152
He said : “ Up to now , these sentiments of the Weniger Wert one and of Anderness gave me the strength and strength , I needed you to be successful . . . ”	-5.6485

His son bears the name of his father Robert who died in 2011 only 40 years after cancer diagnosis .	-3.5280
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets in London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.7622

The stylish Mickelson sat on the Ryder Cup-Saturday at the Bank .	-4.1486
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he has to improve his shape dramatically so that it will not become a sad milestone .	-5.1907
Mickelson , who played for the 12 time at the event that takes place every two years , was set by Captain Jim Furyk for the extra balls and someFours on Saturday on the .	-6.0458
Instead , as is so often the case for the United States , the five-fold majority population divided his day between burning and practice rounds on the golf course , hoping to overcome its depth .	-8.2734
The 48-year-old , even at the peak of his career , is never the most discreet driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square where the long Rough regularly fights frequent failures .	-6.6747
And as if the place alone would not be challenging enough , Mickelson will meet all four matches in the ninth match on Sunday for his precise hit , British-open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-6.4666
If the Americans are lagging behind four points at the start of the 12 individual games and have a hot start , Mickelson 's match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.6001
Furyk expressed his trust in his man ; that was what he left .	-3.7432
" He completely understood the role he had today , gave me a parenthesis on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow " , said Furyk .	-3.3716
“ He has much confidence .	-2.0962
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-2.6632
I would probably not have thought he is playing two games .	-2.2433
I wanted to see more , but it has now surrendered and that is the way we felt we had to get it right .	-6.4769
He wants to be out there just like everyone else .	-1.7294
So far , Nick Faldo holds the record about most played matches in the Ryder Cup .	-3.4715
This could mark the end of the Ryder Cup career , which never showed up to the heights of its individual record .	-5.1393
He also played a role in the team 's role as a captain .	-9.9780
" He is fun , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room " he explained .	-3.6197
I think younger players had fun this week to measure with him , that was nice to look . ”	-3.6902
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.2507
The European captain , Thomas Bjorn , knows that a great leap forward will soon disappear .	-3.7412
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great advance in the individual games of the last day can quickly become an inconvenient rider in the Ryder Cup .	-5.3912
The Danish debut in 1997 at the game in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead from five points to the Americans , but only barely came across the finishing line and won with a ultra-thin lead of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-6.6776
" One remember that one was in Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost , and we won in Valderrama , but only barely " , said Bjorn after he was in the class of 2018 , now with 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-8.9091
History will show me and all in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.5447
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-0.7046
Go out and do the right things .	-7.7096
It is only over when the items on the board are displayed .	-3.1194
Our goal is to win this Cup , and we concentrate on it .	-3.2392
I always said I strongly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we have a strong opponent to do the best players in the world . ”	-2.8706
Björn added : " I would never be premature here .	-3.0194
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.3066
Tomorrow the personal performances come and that is another matter .	-3.2576
It 's great to be out there with a partner if things go well , but if you are out there alone , then your own abilities as golf players will be tested on the whole .	-5.8275
This is the message you have to send to the players : the best out of your reach tomorrow .	-5.5014
Get over to your partner now and you need to do the same as you want . ”	-7.3258
In contrast to Björn , the opposing player Jim Furyk will strive for his players to perform more individually than they do as a partner , except Jordan Spith and Justin Thomas , who took three points .	-5.6165
Furyk himself has experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , and then he was in Brookline 's ; now he after .	-8.3453
" I remember every sentence " , he said on the question of how Ben Crenshah , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on his way into the last day .	-5.1845
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to get started as soon as possible , as you saw in Brookline , in Medicclose .	-7.0107
Once a self-dynamic has developed , this will exert great pressure on the medium matching .	-5.5942
We have built our design accordingly and gave the guys the noise , as we felt we know you are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-7.5026
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tomy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , should give the other European woman in the top rank , the counter-strike against Rory McIlen in the top game .	-6.5449
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way " , Bjorn said about his individual selection .	-3.9495
Once again postponed the timetable for Germany ’ s new war ship	-2.4549
The German Navy would have been in service in 2014 to replace the Cold War ship that had been in use for years , with inadequate systems and escalating costs , according to reports by local media , but now it will take at least until next year .	-9.0331
The commissioning of the “ Rheinland-Pfalz ” , the flagship provider of the new business class Quifers , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , calling for a military speaker .	-7.0390
The Navy should have been in operation in 2014 , but serious problems following the first delivery strained the ambitious project .	-4.7628
The four ships in 2007 will be replaced by the marina operators of the Baden-Württemberg class , replacing the older ships .	-6.7747
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of flight fire extinguishers and maritime sensors and some technologies such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-5.6181
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest clients should be able to use up to two years without running the home port .	-5.1977
However , the most advanced warships to allow Germany to develop a overseas power plan will already be outdated by the constant delays if they are finally being put in service , as the weekly newspaper “ Die Zeit ” notes .	-7.8393
The unhappy F125-Fregate made headlines last year , when the German Navy formally refused to take the ship in operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-5.4023
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery .	-4.0161
There was little known about the reasons for the return of ships ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the war ship useless in combat operations .	-5.0157
Defects in the software were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of approximately 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older collaborations of the Bremen-Class .	-6.4240
It also proved that the ship has a considerable obesity level , limiting performance and making future upgrades difficult for the Navy .	-7.1042
It is assumed that the 7.000-tonne “ Rheinland-Pfalz ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in WWII .	-2.9948
In addition to a faulty hardware , the whole project price plate - including the training of the crew - will also be discussed .	-5.4795
Instead of the original EUR 2.2 billion , the costs have now seem to have reached the staggering sum of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.1449
The problems with the latest TRIPS are particularly important in the light of the recent warnings that Germany 's maritime ship is diminishing .	-5.5028
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Keynes , the chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Committee on Defense , agreed that the fleet would actually “ run ships capable of operation . ”	-6.7053
The official official said that the problem has grown over time , because old ships have been sidelined without a replacement for it .	-6.6570
He refuted that none of Baden-Württemberg ’ s Fredors were served by the navy .	-5.4129
The National Trust throws up the secret life of bats .	-2.5083
New research on a property in the Highlands of Scotland will seek to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-3.8067
It hopes that it will gain new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals , which will provide guidance for future action to protect animals .	-6.5555
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and Sopran-PBTs , as well as brown long-dormant bats and Dauon-bats in the Inverew Gardens in West Ross .	-6.2957
Special recording equipment will be placed at main points of the accommodation to watch flegments throughout the season .	-5.7503
NHS employees and volunteers will also conduct mobile surveys with manual detectors .	-2.6672
A professional tone analysis of all images determines the frequency of the bat and classifies the Ruff species .	-5.8579
The Habitats and the corresponding report should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-3.9067
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out what areas of life are most important for the bats and how they are used by the different species .	-3.7086
This information will help to identify the benefits of life management , how best to preserve the environment and forests for bats and other species associated with it .	-6.4569
There has been a sharp fall in the bulkhos in Scotland and the United Kingdom over the last hundred years .	-5.5999
They are threatened by building works that affect their playgrounds and the loss of living .	-4.6354
Even wind turbines and lighting can be a risk , as well as fly particles and some chemical treatment of building materials , attacks by house cats also play a part .	-6.6153
Fletchers are not blind in fact .	-2.8854
The ears are more useful than their eyes when bent on hunting at night .	-6.2734
They use a sophisticated echo design to localize errors and obstacles in their flight path .	-3.8923
The NTS , responsible for hosting more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-2.8269
There are ten qualified experts who regularly conduct surveys , inspect sleeping spots and sometimes also rescue .	-4.4262
The organization has even created Scotland 's first and only dedicated bat bat in the Threade estate in Dumfris and Galloway , home to eight of the ten Scottish bats .	-5.5714
According to Manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-1.9782
“ Here in Three countries we have a great deal for bats . ”	-4.8562
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good living area .	-2.7181
But there is still much to be learned about bats and the work that we do here and on other land helps us better understand what they need to live . ”	-5.2587
He stresses that it is important to check before maintenance work in buildings whether bats are there , according to which it is possible to downgrade a single of up up up to 400 female and young .	-11.4740
bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill them , to disturb and destroy their sleeping places .	-4.6736
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish collaborator of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.1419
She said : “ We still have a lot to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.5357

Christian lawyer Schertz said that the player will claim compensation for " intangible damage to the gravity of the injury , which is likely to be one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years " .	-5.4793
In June 2009 , the probable event will have occurred in a suite of the Palm Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-4.7385
According to documents filed at Clark County Court in the U.S. state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga withdrew to get to know in a night club in the player ’ s room where he raped them .	-7.0331
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo had fallen to its knees after the alleged incident , and said to her that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” that was abandoned by the “ one percent ” .	-5.2435
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-2.3088
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and made photographs of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extra-judicial agreement because she had " fear of retaliation " and was concerned about becoming " publicly humiliated . "	-6.5773

Brexit : Britain would regret losing it forever .	-2.3301
“ The United Kingdom would regret it in a lifetime if Brexit were to lose its position as the world ’ s leading automobile manufacturer , ” said Minister Greg Clark .	-4.3210
He added that it is ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that it would temporarily cease production at its factory in Burnanton , near Derby , if it were to leave the EU without a deal .	-4.7464
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.3034
Japan ’ s automobile manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the borders in the event of a no-show could cost jobs .	-5.3281
The plant in Burnaston , which manufactures the brands Auris and Aventis for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , of which 90 % were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-4.2560
“ If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that it is a production stop in our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO at Toyota Burnaston .	-4.7908
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rovers .	-3.2011
For example , BMW has already announced that it will close its work for a month in Oxford after Brexit .	-3.7619
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers are saying about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal ' Brexit .	-3.8264
The production facilities of Toyota are based on custom-made production , i.e. , parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for special products .	-4.7792
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there can be delays on the border which , according to industry indications , can cause shortages and shortages .	-5.2448
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of the stock in his plant in Derbyshire , the company said , and so the production would be stopped .	-3.9484
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “ closely calibrated to avoid these controls on the border . ”	-3.7358
We need to have a deal , and we want the best deal that will not only allow us to succeed today , we want to take that opportunity , ” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme .	-6.0878
“ The reference not only of Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful range of supply chains . ”	-4.5550
Toyota did not specify how long the production ban could take , but warned that the increase in costs could , in the long term , jeopardise the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-5.6507

The White House is saying that Trump ’ s meeting with rose stone could be postponed again .	-5.2286
Donald Trump ’ s high-profile meetings with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “ delayed another week , ” as the battle for the Supreme Court board Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-5.8688
Rosenstein supervised the work of the Special Advisor Robert Mueller , who is examining Russian intervention in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstruction of justice by the president .	-4.9913
Whether Trump will or will not become the deputy chief prosecutor , and thus threaten the independence of Müller , Washington has provided much Trams for months .	-5.5920
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the wearing of a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the most 25 constitutional amendment .	-5.0525
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-2.4875
But last Monday he came to the White House , while reports were complaining that he was about to resign .	-3.8835
Instead , a meeting with Trump at that time at the United Nations in New York was announced in Thursday .	-2.1777
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire rose stone , but then the session was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee , where Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , accused him of sexual misconduct .	-4.8592
On Friday , Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh , and continued to delay a full Senate sentiment .	-4.1234
Donald Trump ’ s spokesperson Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-2.4332
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' An appointment has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I am going back another week , given all the other things that go before the Supreme Court .	-6.7245
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-2.9773
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.2374
The guest Chris Wallace wondered why .	-1.9156
Sanders said that the lack of letters was not a dislike of television players , who were like self-manufacturers , but she also said : ' I will not be against being in the gallery ' .	-7.4055
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.2221
" The President carries out more questions and answers than any president before him , " she said , and added , without giving evidence : " We have looked at these figures . "	-6.2373
lettering is still going to take place , Sanders said , but the press should have the opportunity to put the questions directly to the President of the United States , that is infinitely better than talking with it .	-5.7711
We are trying to do much of that and you have seen how we have done this in recent weeks , and a press debate will be replaced if you can talk to the President of the United States himself . ”	-4.9338
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or takes part in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-3.5809
Press conferences with a person are rare .	-1.3167
In New York , the president may have demonstrated why by making a free-standing and sometimes bizarre appearance to reporters assembled .	-5.7943

Weather conditions and the impact of social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sale in the exceptional domestic market .	-3.9212
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups will continue to be under pressure , even though a sales decline of 4.8 % over the previous year will be particularly painful , alongside continuing cost pressure .	-5.8644
The long hot summer could not have arrived at a worse time for food operators , and the time will show whether the moderate temperatures we experienced in August will ensure a much-needed pause .	-5.4883

Milk advertising , for which mothers are compared to cows , has led to controversial online discussions .	-4.6565
Moreover , because of a display that links nursing mothers to melkcows , milk reporting has resulted in controversial online discussions .	-8.4367
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposed " world tapestry and portable milk pump " , Elvie ’ s consumer tech company issued an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-6.4203
Four real mothers dance in a breadcrumble surrounded by cows to a number with the following text : " Yes , I 'm singing me , but you do not see a cock " and " If you have not noticed that it is not a euter , it is my breasts . "	-8.1702
The slogan goes further : " pumping , pump , I feed the baby , pump , pump , pump , pump from , I melt my Ladies " .	-6.9220
However , the display published on the Facebook page of the company has caused online controversy .	-2.2678
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video mixed reactions of the viewers , many of whom say that it highlights the " horror " of the dairy industry .	-4.9326
" It is a very bad decision with cows to advertise this product " .	-3.2959
As we also need to become pregnant and give birth to produce milk , except that they are deprived of their babies within just a few days after birth , " a person wrote .	-4.6835
The Elvie milk pump does not fit into a stillness-H ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-5.5638
Another comment : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-2.5998
But why should we not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.5207
Someone added : " This way an outsider was acquired " .	-3.6709
Others defended advertising , including a woman who admitted that she found the song “ urcomi . ”	-4.7279
I think that is a great idea .	-1.4627
I would have received one if I had still settled .	-2.9805
The pumps made me feel like a cow .	-3.0090
The display is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.4330
This is a great product , " wrote a person .	-2.1962
Another comment made : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who are pumping ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-3.9364
This is not an advertisement to praise or evaluate the milk economy . '	-4.3734
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all settled with the discreet pumps in their BDs .	-4.5186
The campaign ’ s concept is based on the realization that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows .	-2.1333
But Elvie Pump is completely silent , has no wires or hoses and is fit into a still-H , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go on pumping .	-7.6863
Ana Balgren , partner and ECD commented on Mother ’ s comments : " The Elblag pump is such a revolutionary product that has earned a bold and provocative market introduction .	-5.9274
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on the preparation of chest pumps and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and similar way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will .	-5.6773

Hundreds of migrants ’ children moved quietly to a camp on the Texas border .	-3.9164
The number of children arrested with an immigrant background , although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-4.1477
Traditionally , most sponsors themselves have been undocumented immigrants and fear that they will risk being expelled when they are committed to a child .	-3.7918
The risk increased in June when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their budgets would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-3.4716
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , signed before Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied for supporting unaccompanied minors .	-7.8595
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested did not have previous criminal records .	-2.0215
" Nearly 80 % of those who are either sponsors or members of the budget are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal foreigners .	-5.5843
" So we are following these people " , said Albence .	-3.9178

Those who are not eligible for discharge are quickly reduced .	-3.4739
The longer children remain in custody , the more likely it is that they become anxious or depressed , which may lead to violent break or escape .	-4.7667
Advocates said that these concerns are reinforced in a larger body such as Tornillo , where evidence that a child has to fight is more likely to be overlooked due to its size .	-5.3038
They also added that children ’ s move to the tent city , without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to pass away from friends , could worsen a trauma with which many are already fighting .	-6.8170
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to retire immediately .	-2.6753
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moutal also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has now continued for eight years .	-4.4559
Moual , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that , on the pretext of combating terrorism , foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil , and “ one will deal with it accordingly . ”	-5.0701
“ You must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.8542
Moum claimed that the war on terror was almost over in Syria , and that over 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , millions more have been displaced from their homes .	-4.4814
He said that Damascus will continue to “ fight this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-2.7956
The US has roughly 2,000 troops in Syria ; mainly schools and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.3005
France has more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.4785
On the question of refugees , Moum said that the conditions for return were right , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears ” that led refugees to keep away .	-4.3572
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” says Moum .	-2.8728
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian question . ”	-2.2625
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could be reconstruction aid to Syria only when a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was over an end to war .	-4.7944
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold Idlib is capable of pushing forward political talks .	-4.9473
The Russian-Turkish deal blocked a large-scale attack by Russia to support Syrian troops to the province in which three million people live .	-3.2048
However , Moual emphasized that the agreement “ clear deadlines ” was put forward , and he hope that the military action against jihadists , among other things , against fighters from the Nusra Front associated with , that “ ” will .	-7.5965
UN spokesperson de Mistura hopes to convene the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members in order to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-7.1883

Lamb stands against another incumbent , the Republican Republican Keih Rothe , who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which clearly intersects with the new 17 .	-4.3328
The cards were re-mixed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania ruled in January that the old districts were unconstitutional .	-3.9148

But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador , which received an estimated $ 140 million in American aid in 2017 , including stunting mediocre controls , development , and economic support .	-3.7889

But , by mid-September , leaders of the government made it clear that they wanted to continue the conference and thus effectively end the examination of sanctions against El Salvador .	-4.6760
What is now being planned is that Vice President Mike Pence is addressing the conference to be held in mid-October , in order to signal the importance of the Assembly ’ s government , diplomats .	-5.6153

The next extrapolation could be the report by the Special Advisor Robert Mueller on Mr. Trump ’ s possible obstruction of justice , for which there is now very substantial evidence in public files .	-5.5200
Mr Mueller also instructed his inquiry whether Trump ’ s campaign with Russia was consensual in his attack on our elections .	-5.1979

He outlined for the jury how he brought together the movements of the 29-year-old senator , Quinton Tell , and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chamberlain at the night of her death on the basis of mobile recordings .	-6.5127
Rowlett said that he received job data from several mobile phones that showed that Tell was on the evening of her death at Chambers , which rejected his previous claims , The Clarion Least reported .	-7.1649
The analysis of the data on Chambers mobile phone showed that he was in society of his friend Michael Sanford and he was interrogated by the police .	-6.9953
Sanford said on Saturday and said that he was not in town this day .	-3.0320
On the question of prosecutors whether Tell is spent the night in Sanfords Truck , he replied that he had lied because his truck was at Nashville at that time .	-5.4473
Another contradiction was that Tell is said he would have missed Khamenei for about two weeks when he died .	-3.9819
On mobile recordings they knew only one week .	-3.7831
Rowlett said that , according to Khamenei ’ s death , text messages , call and contact information disappear from his phone .	-5.4907

Lynsey Plassco-Flaxman , a mother of two children , was astonished after finding out that her new child care , Giselle Maurice , was black when she started her first day of work in 2016 .	-7.0505
Mrs Plassco Flaxman wrote to her husband in a short communication : ' ' Neiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii	-4.1208
Instead of sending him to her husband , she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice .	-2.6922
After she had noticed her guide , a " uncomfortable emerging " Plasco Flaxman Miss Maurice and declared that her outgoing child child , who was a U.S. , had made a poor job and that she wants to set a Filipino instead , so the New York Post .	-9.6163
Mrs Maurice was paid for her work on a day and then sent home for a translator .	-2.6285
Now , Maurice sued the pair for compensation for dismissal , asking for compensation of $ 350 per day for a six-month full-time bid for which she was originally set , even without contract .	-6.6941
" I want to show them that they do not , " she said to the post on Friday and added : " I know that this discrimination is . "	-7.7268
The couple contracted the claims , and said that the decision to stop Maurces working relationship was sensible and that they acted for fear because they could not trust them after having insulted them .	-6.8556
" My wife sent her something she did not want to say .	-2.1032
It is not racist .	-0.7319
“ We are not racist , ” she told her husband Joel Plassco the Post .	-2.9066
“ Would you entrust your children to someone who , if only by mistake , insulted you ?	-3.8668
Your New Baby ?	-1.9697
I hardly believe . ”	-3.0401
Plassco said that his wife was seven months pregnant and not in the best constitution , and called the case “ blackmail . ”	-5.0409
" You want to attack someone ? "	-1.7562
That is not a very beautiful thing , and the investment bankers added it .	-3.6129
During the dispute , the public quickly condemned the couple in social media and attacked them for their behavior and their thinking .	-4.5753
Paddington-publisher feared that readers could not identify with a heard bears , which revealed a new letter .	-3.9485
Bonds daughter Karen Jankel , who was born shortly after the book was adopted , said about the letter : It is hard to be able to read it for the first time before publication .	-5.5917
“ It is very funny – now that we know about Padingtons of success . ”	-3.6113
She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman , was inspired to write a children 's book from a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected .	-4.5448
As for Paddington , which she calls the “ very important family member , ” she still says that her father was proud of his eventual success in silence .	-6.3108
" He was a rather quiet man , and he was not a bostachhe person , " she said .	-3.1787
“ But because Paddington was so real for him , it was almost as if you have a child that reaches something : you are proud of the child , although it is not really your job .	-4.9545
I think he has seen Padniton 's success a little so .	-4.2768
Though it was his creation and his idea , Paddington itself was always paying credit . ”	-4.0708
My daughter died and I had to leave on the phone .	-1.7862
When landing , her daughter was brought to hospital Louis Pasteur 2 in Nice , where doctors tried in vain to save their lives .	-2.9272
" Nad has regularly called to say that it was really bad that she probably did not create it " , said Ms Ednann-Laperouse .	-5.5511
Then I got the call from Nad , saying she would die in the next two minutes , and I had to leave her .	-3.9110
And I did .	-1.1268
I said , “ Tashi , I love you so much .	-2.1486
I will be with you soon .	-1.3791
I will be with you . ”	-1.0084
The medicine that had given her the nerve so that her heart continued to lean , left slowly and left her body .	-6.0704
She had died some time before and that brought everything to a standstill .	-3.5008
I simply had to sit there and wait , knowing what happens .	-2.2496
I could not talk up or cry because I was surrounded by the situation of families and other people .	-3.5545
I really had to work together .	-2.0246

Disallow women to design cards for the prevention of suicide on a bridge	-4.7149
Two women who have lost a loved person through suicide want to prevent others from taking their lives .	-2.9881
Sharon Davis and Kelly Humphrey posted cards on a Welsh bridge with inspiring news and telephone numbers that people can call if you need support .	-4.3741
Mrs Davis 's son , Tyrler , was 13 years old when he suffered depression and at the age of 18 he was involved .	-4.1551
“ I want no parent to feel as I do it every day , ” she said .	-2.2921
Mrs Davis , 45 years of age and from LySidney , described her son as a promising cook with infectious smile .	-4.3310
“ He was known for his smile .	-1.3424
Everyone said , his smile has lit every room . ”	-3.7622
But he had abandoned his job before his death , because he was “ mentally ill . ”	-4.0514
In 2014 , Tyler , who was eleven years old at that time , found his brother after he had taken his life . , , , , , and then , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.6503
Mrs Davis said : “ I am constantly concerned that this could have a knock-on effect . ”	-2.5590
Mrs Davis has designed the cards “ to let people know that there is someone with whom they can talk , even if there is only one friend ” .	-4.6011
Sit not quiet - you have to talk . "	-2.8134
Mrs Humphreys , who has been a friend to Mrs Davies for years , lost her life at the risk of Mark , with whom she was 15 years old .	-7.2956

The FBI investigations have started , and board Kavanugh 's future is at stake .	-5.1654
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for - an investigation that is limited to time and scale - we could perhaps achieve a little consensus , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday and added that he fear that the committee is “ divided up ” in the midst of a deep-seated party political blockade .	-14.9649
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to be established ?	-1.6491
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-1.4626
Until the mid-term elections , it is only five weeks , on 6 November , when the Republicans are performing badly , they will be greatly weakened in an attempt to move forward the man who is elected to the highest court in the country .	-6.8760

North Korea ’ s Republican zone has fallen under Kim .	-3.1647
The figure of North Korea ’ s runner to South Korea has declined since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korea MP said .	-5.0302
Under the appeal to data from the Southern Association Ministry , Park Byiong-Kai provided that last year there were 1.127 of his loyalty commands – compared to 2.706 in 2011 .	-8.0242
Park said that tighter border controls between North Korea and China and a rise in prices among traffickers play a significant role in this .	-3.6821
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly .	-1.7500
Finally , the majority of North Korea ’ s Anglo-Saxon citizens receive South Korea ’ s citizenship .	-3.5225
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the Korean War in 1953 .	-2.1083
Most of them flee over China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly militarised zone between North and South Korea .	-4.1252
China regards finishers as illegal migrants , not as refugees , and often brings them back .	-5.0786
The relations between the north and the south , formally still in war , have improved considerably in recent months .	-3.3453
At the beginning of the month , the leaders of both countries in Pyongyang met with talks about the stalled negotiations on de-nuclear integration .	-4.0801
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore , when they largely agreed on the South Korean Peninsula nuclear-free .	-8.0714
But on Saturday , North Korea ’ s foreign minister Ria Yosg-ho blamed the US for lack of progress since then .	-2.9636

Nancy Pelosi is a board of Kavanaugh as hysterical and says that he is unsuitable for the service of the Supreme Court .	-4.5193
The leader of democratic minority groups , Nancy Pelosi , called board Kavanaugh , called the candidate for a seat on the Supreme Court “ hysterical ” and said that he was incapable of serving the Supreme Court by temperament .	-4.4812
Pelosi made comments at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-3.3074
“ I could not think otherwise that if a woman had ever acted in this way , she would have called it “ hysterical ” , Pelosi said her response to Kavanah ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s refusal to respond on Thursday .	-6.7596
Unfortunately , this was not the case .	-7.0146
During his opening speech Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes writing almost and fought with tears when he spoke about his family and his high school years .	-3.2133
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated campaign of imprisonment ” organised by liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016 .	-4.5486
Pelosi said that she believed that caviar 's statement had shown that he could not serve before the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against Democrats .	-5.8038
“ I believe that he has such statements and the way in which he can influence himself by the Clintons and the Democrats , ” she said .	-4.3042
When she was asked whether , in the case of his confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , she would seek an impeachment procedure against Kavanaugh , he would be hesitant .	-5.0010
“ I want to say the following : if he does not say the truth to Congress or the FBI , he is not only unfit for the service of the Supreme Court , but also for the service at the court in which he is currently working , ” he declared Pelosi .	-8.6314
Kavanaugh is currently the court of jurisdiction in D.C.	-3.7056
Pelosi added that she , as a democrat , was concerned about possible minor judgments against the Affordable Care Act , or Lords .	-6.3270
His confirmation made it clear that there were minor questions about whether he would defer certain decisions of the Supreme Court .	-6.2992
“ It is not time for a hysterical , biased person to go to the courts and we expected that we say , “ Is that not wonderful , ” said Pelosi .	-5.7628
And women must respect it .	-2.4777
It is a genuine narrative , months and years of rage , and it cannot catch up without crying .	-4.3110
" We cry when we get angry , " Mrs Steinem 45 years later said to me .	-3.5075
" I do not think that is unusual , or ? "	-2.6644
She continued : “ I once helped a woman , in the executive , who told me that she was also crying when she was angry , but she developed a technique where she was angry and crying , to the person with whom she spoke , said : “ They like me to think that I am sad because I am wines .	-7.1472
I am angry . '	-1.8564
And then she just made it .	-3.1312
And I thought this was brilliant . ”	-3.0368
tears are allowed as a valve of anger because they are basically misunderstood .	-2.2694
One of my strongest memories of an early job in an office dominated by men , where I once weaned with indescribable anger , was that I was wrapped up by an older woman , a ekier manager before I was always scared - who drove me into a staircase .	-6.7657
" Let them never cry , " she told me .	-3.3398
" You do not know that you are angry .	-1.5505
They think you are sad and will be happy because they have caught you . "	-4.0292
Patricia Schroeder , then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado , had supported Gary Hart in his presidential campaign .	-2.5375
In 1987 , he was known that Mr. Hart had an extramarital affair on board a boat called “ Monkey Business ” ; Ms. Schroreder , deeply frustrated , thought that were no reason to run .	-17.1325
“ It was not a well thought-out decision , ” she told me of a miracle 30 years later .	-2.9240
" There were already seven more candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-2.2128
Someone called it " Snow White and the seven Dwarfs " .	-2.1590
Because the campaign has been under way for a long time now , it has been delayed with the acquisition of funds , and so she swore that she would not participate in the race unless they collected $ 2 million .	-6.8347
It was a lost battle .	-1.1807
She noted that some of her followers , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give her $ 250 .	-3.1434
“ Think the one , I get advance lorberries ? ”	-6.3931
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotion - gratitude for the people she had supported - frustration over the system , which made it so difficult to collect money and talk to voters instead of delegates , and anger about sexism - that she was smothered .	-5.9401
“ One might think I had a nervous breakdown , ” Schroeder recalls about how the press responded to it .	-6.2040
" It would have been thought that Kleenex is my corporate sponsor .	-2.7151
I remember having thought about what they would write on my tombstone .	-2.4045

How the trade war between China and the US could be beneficial to Beijing	-2.4993
The opening quakes of the trade war between the US and China were deafening and an end to the conflict is not in sight .	-5.5891
US President Donald Trump triggered the first warning at the beginning of the year by selling important Chinese exports , such as solar panels , steel , and aluminum .	-3.8484
The introduction of new tariffs on US imported Chinese products worth $ 200 billion ( <unk> 150 billion ) this week led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-3.2027
Beijing has consistently consistently derided itself in terms of assets , with tariffs of between five and ten % on American goods worth $ 60 billion .	-6.9650
China answers each shot by the US , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will decline in the near future .	-3.7120
To paraphrase Washington would give in to demands , but to publicly bow to the United States would be far too black for Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-5.9100
But , if Beijing takes proper advantage of its opportunities , the US trade war can have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies , experts say .	-5.6251
“ The fact that a quick political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers had previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , scientific collaborator at the Center for New American Security , a think factory with the focus of Asia .	-4.0239
Syria is prepared to ' return refugees ' , says the Foreign Minister .	-2.4109

The government continues to repair the areas destroyed by terrorists in order to restore normality .	-2.7147
Now all the conditions for the voluntary return of refugees to the country they had to leave on the basis of terrorism and unilateral economic measures aimed at their daily lives and their livelihood .	-4.5740
The UN estimates that more than 5.5 million Syrians have fled the country since the start of war in 2011 .	-1.6150
Another six million people still live in the country need humanitarian aid .	-1.8739
Al-mouse said that the Syrian regime would welcome aid in the reconstruction of the devastated country .	-2.5411
But he emphasized that he would not accept conditional support or assistance from countries that have funded the uprising .	-2.8926
