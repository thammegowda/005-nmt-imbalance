While China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , Investor , and AI practitioners working for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.5101
These demands were made after US government officials made announcements on AI , even though the US lacks a formal KI strategy .	-3.8485
Meanwhile , China has presented its plan last year : by 2030 it wants to be number 1 in the field of KI innovation .	-2.6957
“ Double expenditure on KI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are well behind the US , and a breakthrough in KI research is about to come , ” said Lee .	-4.4082
Doubling finance could double the chances of achieving the next achievement in the US artificial intelligence , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.5527
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpower : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( KI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ) ” was released this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the best-known Chinese KI companies , Face + , .	-8.4314
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in a KI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello player , and was leader at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese branch of Google .	-5.1117
Lee acknowledged the US government ’ s previous technological competition , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defence Research Authority ) , and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.3412
“ Researchers in the US often need to work very hard to get government grants , ” said Lee .	-2.0787
“ Not China is responsible for the flow of high-level scientists , but for companies , ” noted Lee .	-2.7292
In recent years , Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have stopped coryphies of universities to work on AI .	-3.6824
Lee said that a modified immigration policy could also help the US to boost its AI efforts .	-3.5542
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered PhD channels in KI , ” he said .	-2.3982
The Chinese State Council presented its development plan for the next generation of artificial intelligence ( Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan ) in July 2017 .	-2.2110
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to what the National Science Foundation and other governmental organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-3.6393
Earlier this year , the US founded the Department of Defence , a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center , the Industry Partner and Science Partner , and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-3.7036
And this month , DARPA announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an initiative called AI Next .	-1.8673
As far as the NSF is concerned , it is currently investing more than $ 100 million a year in KI research .	-1.8738

Macedonia is voting in a referendum on whether to change the country 's name .	-2.3340
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday whether their name should be changed in ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step which would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-4.0181
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim to Greek territory , and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.6707
The two governments concluded in June an agreement based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia ’ s Slavic majority population .	-2.8347
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum , and , given a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the result will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-3.7946
The question of the voting paper on the referendum was : ' Are you for NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-7.9599
Advocates of name change , including Prime Minister Zaev , argue that it is worth carrying on with the admission to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries that will emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.5754
“ I came today to vote on the future of the country , a decision for young people in Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , for that means life in more security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 in Skopje .	-3.8273
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote , so that it is crucial . .	-7.7745

The Committee on Agriculture and Rural Vaccination said at 13 p.m. that there were no reports about irregularities .	-4.4123

“ I chose for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a constituent in the capital , Skopje .	-2.5004
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica , and his son , Dushko , delivered their voice to the referendum in Macedonia on the revision of the country ’ s name , which would pave him the way for NATO and the European Union ’ s accession to Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.8824
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents set by those who are boycotted the referendum .	-2.9388
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to take part with the heads up , not through the service door , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.5535
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.0718
If you do not want to take us as Macedonia , we can turn to others like China and Russia to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.8041
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-6.4483
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” said Zaev after giving his vote .	-3.5714
He says that the outcome would be ‘ yes ’ to reinforce our future .	-3.4164
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-2.6402
Another survey carried out by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV revealed that 57 percent of people on Sunday will cast their vot.	-3.5315
Of those who want to participate , 70 percent said yes .	-3.3272
The referendum will be approved only if the turnout is above 50 % .	-3.1977
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since its takeover in May last year .	-2.4684

Then Agüero was surrounded by three main hurdles .	-2.7497
He handled a defender before he ran several players on the edge of the Brighton Strafraume .	-7.1322
Then he left a passport and gave off at sterling .	-3.7655
The English storm used his first contact to play the ball back to Agüero , who shot with the right – past Brighton Torwart Mathew Ryan to the right side of the gate .	-3.9227
“ Aguero has foot-troubles , ” said City-Manager Pep Guardiola to the reporters .	-2.9031
" We spoke about it ; it played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.3432
That has happened .	-1.2328
Fortunately , he shot a gate in the moment . ”	-2.1994
However , it was Sterling who first led the Sky Blues into the Premier League Duel :	-3.6341

Scherzer wants to play play play games against rockies . !	-8.1193
Because national players were excluded from the competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-3.5148
But the hard-battled Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are Playoff implications for the rockies that lead from a game in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-4.3253
The rockies secured at least one place lead with a 5 : 2 victory over the national on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not safe .	-10.3006

The nations have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but they are supposedly inclined to make Scherzer thrown in such a situation .	-4.2005

“ The Democrats ’ goal is to resist and block , ” he said .	-6.4797
" You see this in the last four days , " he said , and called the democrats ' angry and common , evil , and untrue ' .	-3.8610

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.0675
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.9060
As a moment activist in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.7721
Lastly , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs saying that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-7.8783
My group colleague Joan Ryan was treated in a similar manner because she chose to oppose anti-Semitism .	-3.2869
In my case , I have been criticised by the motion of censure because I do not agree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-1.8426
Ironically similar issues were important for a responsible economic policy , for national security , for Europe , where Jeremy was unable to agree with previous Heads .	-4.1814
The Nottingham East-Labour Communication on Friday states : ' We want meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-3.2036
Most of my time as a local Labour MEP in the eight years were the GC meetings on Friday evening exactly the same .	-3.1164
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a " more friendly , soft " policy has long been forgotten , if it ever began .	-3.7954
It has become increasingly apparent that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is judged as to whether they are acceptable to party leadership .	-4.4432
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s mandate , because my fellow Members , with whom I had thought I had a similar political attitude , were expecting that I would be turning out and adopting positions that I would otherwise never have agreed with , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-7.4166
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for dismissal , denouncing the Centre ’ s policies and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-8.0386
This experience is not just my own .	-3.1101
I do know , in fact , that more happiness than some of my colleagues , since the comments to me tend to be political .	-3.4457
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are subjected every day to a flood of sexist or racist abuse , but never deter .	-3.6344
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the scale of abuse has normalized .	-2.3666
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.5395
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or amendment of the rules of selection , the party will become smaller .	-4.4217
Over the last two years I have received a lot of advice to recover my neck , not to be so loud , and then I would be ‘ in order ’ .	-5.0280
But for this reason I did not get into politics .	-1.9381
Thirty-two years ago , as a student , I joined Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , which led me to have literally collapsed my classroom , so I tried to work for better public services for those who need it most , no matter whether as or minist.	-6.4740
I have never hidden my political views , even at the last elections .	-2.3761
As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , and that applies to areas where I do not agree with the current leadership .	-8.6773
I would just like to say to those who supported the motion on Friday that I do not understand why they waste time and energy to remain loyal to me and to the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that is detrimental to households , businesses and public services .	-4.5273
But the only message I have is not just about Nottingham momentum , but about my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not be holding any threats to elect or political opportunities from work in the work , which I believe is the best interest of all of you .	-6.5497

Robyn Christie of Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have used their opportunities better . ”	-2.8465
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute transformed by Frazier Climo brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , given for the game of warriors , Melrose allowed to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot to make an untransformed attempt .	-4.1509
Climo exposed Ayr ’ s leadership to a punishment before he reached a hit directly at the half-time , and then made a solo request that he succeeded in the 17 : 5 break for Ayr .	-7.4422
Melrose , however , started the second half time well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed from Baggot , reduced the delay to five points .	-3.3004
After the reboot , Ayr rebuilt the leadership when a Try of Stafford McDowall was transformed by Climo .	-6.4400
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson got the yellow card , and Melrose once again paid the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine trial , at the end of a curse of heavy pressure .	-4.8210

Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – also depends heavily on Monday ’ s decision .	-2.8752
“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he said at the end of August .	-2.4918
However , some analysts consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not change .	-8.6770
The Dutch UN body has no power to forgive Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.0828
The fact that the International Court of Justice ruling came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was not complicated , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-4.0867
And far from pushing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years could have put it back .	-3.7525
“ The question of maritime access is used by the current Bolivian government for its purposes , ” said Zárate .	-2.5376
Morales warrior rhetoric destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , she suggested .	-2.4599

Trump will certainly respond to this week ’ s hearings on the accusations of sexual abuse against his candidates for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation of the Senate was postponed by at least a week until FBI investigations were completed .	-4.5889
But the main objective of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans , who are facing a decisive election in November .	-3.7617
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilise volunteers and supporters with the five electoral events next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House .	-3.7252
“ The majority in Congress is first on the president ’ s agenda , so he visits as many states as possible shortly before the launch of the turbulent election season , ” a spokesman of the Trump campaign , who would not be named , reuters .	-5.1455

Trump is trying to help the Republicans ’ candidate for the West Virginia Senate Patrick Morrisey , who lags behind in polls .	-2.7008

Ryder Cup 2018 : The U.S. team is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday Sings .	-3.3885
After three unilateral meetings , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.4711
The dwindling pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that the players have inspired , especially in competitions like this .	-5.2478
So where would they say is the momentum now ?	-1.6749
“ They had a six-point lead and now there are four , so I think that is a bit of momentum , ” said Jordan Spieth when he went back for the day . ”	-5.0485
Of course , Europe is at the forefront of four points ; there are twelve more to play .	-4.7251
But the Americans , as Spieth sails say , feel a little wind in their sails and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played the whole day together and each have three of four points .	-5.5038
Spieth was initially considered and set an example .	-4.4851
These tired rebels were louder when his round continued , he dropped a decisive putt to reach a draw in the game 4 after he and Thomas returned 2 points after 2 matches .	-6.6837
His joy over the Put on the 15th hole with which they won the game was such that one thought he was still believing in the victory of the Americans .	-4.3651
“ You really have to concentrate strongly and only worry about your own game , ” said Spieth .	-3.8666
That is all that each player has left .	-3.5935
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.2420
On this Ryder Cup , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood have been undeniably the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-4.1770
Europe 's strange but admirable pair plays error-free and does everything right .	-3.8643
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not get a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided them on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning the rear nine .	-3.9909
This run and the way their energy appears to flow from this omitted quantity of viewers makes it into the favorites on Sunday and when the sun passes through Le Golf National there would be no more popular player who defeats a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-5.4439
Probably both at different holes at the same time .	-2.0533
Speaking of a European victory now would be too hasty .	-1.8003
Bubbba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trial with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-3.1423
With a bogey and two doubles at the first nine , the Spaniard and the Swede enter into a hole that they never came out again .	-4.0243
On Sunday , however , no one can help you from your hole .	-2.4370
Because of the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the ungiven advice and the way a strategy can change in the right direction , it is very fascinating to watch the fourballs and foursomes from close proximity .	-5.7547
Europe has played better as a team so far , taking on a clear lead in the last day , but this foursome-session has also shown that the US team has the desire to fight , as some , particularly Stateside , have doubted .	-5.9124
Europe leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.3150
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the four-and-four-game on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-4.3438
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two wins over a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its past record in Le Golf National to four points .	-3.9204
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took over the preservation of the trophy that she lost in Hazettine two years ago , dominated a American team with officers , and won the 3-1 series .	-5.2612
The US offered more resistance to the fourth and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-6.8139
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 singles from Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.3538
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row , while he and Molinari , named after a sensational weekend " Molliwood " , are only the second couple winning four points from their first four in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.9982
Having broken Woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs , it was assured that they would strike an even clearer 5 & 4 with an American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau .	-5.0867
Woods , who returned through two parties on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 parties in four balls and fours and seven in consequence .	-4.8590
Justin Rose , rested for the Fourballs tomorrow , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes , proposing a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – one place and three in the world .	-4.3626
On a pleasant , airy day south-west of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.7403
Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , three main winners , set the standard for the Americans on Saturday . , with , , , , , and , , and , , , and , , the , . , and , , , , ,	-10.3830
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after losing the first two holes .	-2.8960
Only twice in Ryder Cup history , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the single , although Holter Furyk 's page requires only one push to keep the trophy .	-4.9769
After two days of second best , however , a Sunday account looks like he would go beyond them .	-3.7823
North Korea says that there will be “ no reciprocal disarmament without confidence . ”	-2.4030
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its suspicion of the United States , and that , under such circumstances , the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.9068
Ri Yong Ho told the annual General Assembly of the World Institute that last year North Korea adopted ' significant goodwill measures ' , such as the abandonment of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of nuclear testing and the commitment to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-5.2565
" There is no response from the United States , " he said .	-3.2910
“ Without any trust in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no chance that we will first disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-4.2731
While Ri revealed the famous North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to discharge , which would reward North Korea with gradual steps , his declaration seemed important in that it did not completely reject unilateral nuclear tariffs , as Pyongyang has done in the past .	-6.1628
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an incumbent US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed himself to work towards " declaring the Korean Peninsula " , while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea 's security .	-4.6747
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons .	-2.4202
Washington has also defied the demand for the relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.8272
The US insists on ' denuclearization first ' ( initially de-nuclear arization ) and increases the pressure from sanctions to achieve its purpose in an obligatory way , and even reject the ' declaration of the end of the war ' , Ri said .	-5.3973
" The perception that sanctions can force us to knees is a dream of people who are ignorant of us .	-2.2921
But the problem is that continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust . ”	-2.0300
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week .	-2.6330
Instead , the minister raised three Kim meetings with South Korea ’ s leader , Moon Jae-in the last five months , and added : ' If the party had not entered such a deadlock on this issue of South Korea and not the US , then the unnuclear isolation of the Korean Peninsula would not have come into such a deadlock ' .	-7.3466
Nonetheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly that targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim was called the “ missile . ”	-5.1278
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ completely destroy North Korea , ” praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but also said that a great deal of work had to be done , and sanctions have to remain until North Korea destroyed nuclear disarmament .	-4.2054
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no timeframe and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.1671
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.7095
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said by the UN , Security Council on Thursday , that ' enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without continuation until we achieve full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-4.7813
The Security Council has unanimously increased the sanctions against North Korea since 2006 to prevent the financing of the nuclear and Ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang .	-3.0032
Pompeo met Ri on the periphery of the UN General Assembly and afterwards he would travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.1598
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-1.7924
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress was made , and only a few hours after that North Korea condemned him to “ make similar demands . ”	-4.3311
In a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex when the United States adopts ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.4750
He said that Kim told him that the " corresponding measures " he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.0192
Harvard students participate in the course to find enough peace .	-2.7580
With a new course at Harvard University this year , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of the studio of caffeine night studies .	-5.0988
A scientist has found that students at a world leader university are often unpuzzled when helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.2868
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep-medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believed is the first of his kind in the US .	-3.8108
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of lack of sleep on learning .	-3.1356
In the end , a girl came to me and said : ' Why is this to me only now , in my final year , being told ?	-4.1312
She said that no one had ever told about the importance of sleep – which surprised me , ” he told the telograph .	-4.2021
This year ’ s course , which is being offered for the first time , explains to students how good sleep habits foster academic and sporting performance and improve their general wellbeing .	-4.1142
Paul Barreira , a professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that the students had slept extremely little during the week .	-4.2443
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.4990
In one section , there is a picture of a sleeping hall where students click on coffee asses , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and how sports performance affects a sleep shortage and the meaning of a sleep time routine .	-6.5235
Another section explains how long-term sleeping enough can increase the risk of heart attack , smuggling , depression and cancer .	-4.4120
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to reflect on their daily lives .	-2.5106
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-1.4396
" But we believe they have a right - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czeisler .	-2.7985
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and the increasing pressure on pupils and students sleeping makes a growing problem .	-3.5374
He said - not to raise , because sleeping enough puts the brain in hunger mode and makes it hungry .	-5.9729
Raymond Than , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he visited one of his classes in Harvard last year .	-3.6085
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press for a campus-wide course .	-1.5935
The next step , he hopes , is to ask all the Photographers to complete a similar study programme before entering the Competition University .	-4.7255
Prof. Czeisler recommended the students to set an alarm when they should go into bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " radiated by electronic screens and LED lighting that can bring their circan-cadian rhythm out , leading to problems with sleep .	-6.6160
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal erupts Gerrards men .	-3.0039
Other Rangers Foreign Problems : after a meeting of Dolly Menga , Livingston came to 1-to-0 defeat for Steven Gerrard ’ s unique team .	-11.5132
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since February 4 : 1-Triumph in St. Johnstone , but Gerrard 's second defeat in 18 games as trainers returned to eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroken Prime Minister Hearts .	-5.5712
Menga landed a hit seven minutes prior to the half-time and an inspirational ranger setting did not look like they could compensate .	-4.6811
As the rangers now fall back to the sixth place , Livingston climb rank three and are only because of the gate difference behind Hibernian .	-4.5976
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , as Linienrichter Calum Spence provided a headwood after being hit by a litter – apparently thrown away from the foreign fans sector .	-7.8194
Gerrard made eight alternatives to the side passed by Ayr and hit directly into the half-finals of Betfred Cup .	-4.6361
Hold , on the other hand , the same Livi Elf , which declined a point last week ’ s Hearts , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not make room for action at any time .	-6.8088
The rangers dominated ball ownership , but Livingstone better realized opportunities .	-4.6148
You should have met after only two minutes , when mengas first Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregor 's gate , but the middle field player passed his big chances at the gate .	-5.0418
A deeper freeze from Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far behind posts .	-4.8245
Rangers took over control , but there seemed to be more hope than injuries in their own game , the last third .	-4.2349
Alfredo Morelos clearly believed after the first quarter of this hour that he deserved an Elfmeter after he collided with Steven Lawless , but Arbitrator Steven Thomson did not receive the appeals of the Colombian . to . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.6609
The Rangers are only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox-Torhüter Liam Kelly was hardly removed from Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and the hit of a bislo Ovie Ejaria .	-5.5538
Although Livis opening figures at the 34th minute may have been against the game , nobody can deny that they have earned it for their efforts alone .	-5.1106
Again , the Rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.4201
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson reacted to the ball that kept the rest and picked up menga for a simple finish .	-4.2527
Gerrard acted during the break when he converted Coulibaly against Ryan Kent , and the change immediately affected the game when the winger played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-4.2687
But Livingston continued to attract guests the very kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett celebrating long balls after long balls .	-4.4280
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership during the final phase , but McGregor was well off to deny Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner .	-4.4522
The Rangers-Representative Glenn Midleton had another delayed claim to a penalty because he hid Jacobs , but once again he saw Thomson out .	-5.8787
Almanach : The inventor of the Geiger Counter	-1.6921
And now one page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger was born in Germany .	-3.9241
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually caused the device known as Geiger .	-3.3699
Since then , Geiger has also become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which appears to be unlikely cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-4.4660
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-1.8146
Rogers : “ It is a horror narrative used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.9980
When you suspend these headphones , you can actually listen to the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals . ”	-3.7625
Evans : “ Tell you , but now it is cracking ! ”	-3.7096
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.4354
But the invention that bears its name will continue to be used .	-1.9215
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” evil cells .	-1.0982
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill evil cells .	-1.3921
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malignant cells as part of treatment . to to to to to to to . to to to to to to to .	-8.7454
The process involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modifying these in the laboratory .	-6.9842
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject again .	-2.2835
A study vaccine shows promising results for patients with a number of cancers .	-2.1210
A woman who was treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw their egg stock cancer disappeared for more than 18 months .	-2.8621
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , to change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many cancers , and then to inject cells again .	-4.1166
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland said : " Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-2.5699
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer , ” including breast , egg stock , lung and intestinal cancer , said Prof. Berzofsky .	-8.7643
A similar approach to taking patients immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-3.3390

It did not go well .	-2.0478

Having listed his third song of night , Ghost Town , while holding a Make America Great Mütze , he hated Democrats , and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.3870
" So often I speak to a white person and she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.5325

Although it was not broadcast , the film material of west 's husband was divided by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-4.9478
It is unclear whether Rock has attempted to mock West with the post .	-2.4016
West , too , complained to the audience that he had had been hard behind the stage because of his headcover .	-8.0404
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-2.1445
They said : ' Do not go out with the hat . '	-1.9228
You annoyed me !	-1.4132
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.2314
West continued : " Want to see the diminished place ? " and said that he " would attract my superman changeover , because that means that you cannot tell me what I should do .	-5.9174
Try it with love . ”	-0.6669
His comments were quoted twice by the audience with bullets and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to be moved , reported variety , and quoted a person in the words : “ The whole studio was dead . ”	-5.3019
West was used as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-5.3231
West astonished many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , clothed as Perrier Bottle .	-3.2503
West received support from the Chief of the Conservative Group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who twittered : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : DANKE , DASS DU DER MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-3.6873

“ It is extremely annoying that things are denied , ” meat wrote .	-4.0726
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a member of the Congress .	-2.5638
If someone is accused of doing something , he must not be evil .	-2.3460
They must not be liable .	-2.7788
You must not challenge the plaintiff 's motives .	-2.2212
They have to be calm and calm . ”	-2.6077
Meat seemed to compare the Democrats ’ reaction to Judge Kavanaugh ’ s criticism , accused of critics , during the hearing on Thursday .	-4.2425
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ranks next to the seatless Waters , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-3.3018
“ Big , if true , ” he wrote .	-2.1726
In her statement Waters said that her office ' has informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-3.2338
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are held accountable and that their actions , which have a destructive and dangerous impact on my employees , ” they continued .	-3.8493
Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.3994
It is a tradition to search for suggestions in every new film with British tendency to Brexit , and this appears to be applicable to the revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy Spoof franchise .	-5.8659
Is the ironic self-satire of the passing humanity the new export of the nation ?	-4.2008
In any case , the gloomy , rubbish and incompetent Johnny English has received the license for the second time to mask things .	-5.5416
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent , who , despite his bizarre claims for smoothy glamour , received a little clouseau , a spritzer Mr. Bean and a clack of this guy and who contributed a single note to the guiding melody of fire defense at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-10.8747
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the Barclaycard television advertisements that have now been forgotten , that is always trailing chaos . .	-6.4672
There are one or two nice moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.3822
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and briefly beats the main rotor against his helmet .	-2.9111
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels pretty weak and strangely superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission impossible self-confident comedy as ingredient .	-3.8681
The humor feels like being directed more at children than at adults , and for me , the madness of Johnny English is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson 's Mr. Bean movies .	-4.5015
The everlasting premise is now that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.5367
A cyber hacker infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the spot to displace the servant agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.7133
Emma Thompson is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and struggling personality and already suffers a complete core meltdown of political unpopularity .	-5.1476
She informs her intelligence consultants that , as each individual active spy was compromised , she needs to get someone out of retirement .	-4.1665
This means that the great Johnny English itself , which is now a school champion in a noble facility , but grants unsurpassed lessons about how one operates as an undercover agent : some nice gags here while English offers a School of Rock Academy on Spionage .	-6.1271
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency operation and reunited with its former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , which is played by Ben Miller again .	-4.2693
Bough is now a married man who hits a submarine commander , an exhaustive burschikosis role in which Vicki Pepperdine does not fully assume .	-4.7304
So the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are again in action and meet on Olga Kurylenko 's beautiful Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.5605
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is running dangerously in the banner of the charismatic tech billionaire , who claims to be able to solve the British computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.4358
English and Bough begin their Odyssey of colourful Highjinks : As a cellar falls , they unravel a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board of Voltas luxury yachts ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a virtual reality headset with the inside of Voltas house .	-6.7322
All the registers have certainly been drafted for this last sequence , but as lovely and omitted they are , the whole reminds of children 's television .	-6.5659
Very moderate .	-1.7917
And , as with the other Johnny English films , I could not forget : can the British film industry give Rowan Atkinson a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.4670
Labour disputes having developed a plan for Britons for a four-day week for which five days are paid . .	-10.0197
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan where Britons work only four days a week but are paid for five .	-3.6112
According to reports , the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the revolution of artificial intelligence ( AI ) to workers by giving them an additional day .	-4.2241
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still make the same money home .	-2.2296
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plan to tilt the country for the benefit of workers .	-4.3177
The Trade Union Congress has approved the conversion to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-3.9373
A high-level source of the Labour Party said Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.8314
A four-day week is an objective that is in line with the Party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance for the benefit of workers and the Party ’ s general industrial strategy , but this goal will not be achieved overnight .	-4.5296
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its election campaign in 2017 . , , , .	-6.5627
However , the entire Labour Party does not currently support this move .	-2.7016
A Labour Party spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-3.1341
Treasury Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to concrete his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.2903
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to recover the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit makers ' from utilities .	-3.6549
The shadow Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not get their whole share , because a Labour government could make “ deductions ” on the grounds of alleged misconduct .	-5.9041
He also confirmed the plans to appoint workers in the management of entrepreneurs and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private-sector equity to employees receiving annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-11.1579
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh might change their mind .	-2.7369
The final vote on the appeal of the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , and the question of whether the investigation results of the FBI could lead to republican senators to give up their support for Kavanaugh is raised .	-5.7531
In a Sunday interview Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes ” , Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham surveyed whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could push them to change their opinion .	-4.4211
Kennedy appeared more resolute than his colleague from South Carolina .	-2.8557
“ Anyway , ” said Kennedy .	-1.9754
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Justice Kavanaugh .	-1.7285
I called him after that happened after that claim came out , I said : ' Do you do it ? '	-4.0958
He was determined , targeted , unequivocal . '	-1.4017
Graham 's voice seemed to be scored in stone , however .	-2.4334
" I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb accusation , " he said .	-3.1781
“ Dr Ford , I don ’ t know what happened , but I know that Brett vehemently disputed the accusation , ” Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-3.7731
" No one they called it could confirm .	-1.6506
It was 36 years ago .	-0.5784

" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has ensured poverty reduction ? "	-1.5329
On this Saturday , New York is hosting the Global Citizen Festival , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end world poverty .	-3.2852
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people at the Great Lawn in the Central Park in order not only to experience stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-6.6807
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-2.9512
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or actions , such as voluntary work , an email to a leader in the world , a telephone or another sensible way to raise the goal of combating poverty and raise awareness .	-9.9358
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.3983
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way of convincing people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel like sending a tweet by signing an online petition or an online application , or by doing so , as if they were making a real difference ?	-4.5819
Global Citizen says that , since 2011 , it has listed more than 19 million “ actions ” of its supporters , pushing for a variety of objectives .	-3.8632
It is said that these actions have motivated global leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , affecting the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-2.5412
In early 2018 , the Group launched 390 operations and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid out or financed .	-6.8655
The group estimates that the funds made available have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world .	-2.6304
One of the most important pledges is The Power of Nutrition , a UK partnership of investors and executive organisations committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to support Rwanda with $ 35 million to end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens received more than 4,700 tweets .	-4.8067
“ With the support of the British Government , donors , other state governments , and Global Citizens as you can , we can ensure that the social injustice of malnutrition is history one day , ” announced The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman of the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-5.4218
The Group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the UK , which aimed to improve the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will reach the financing of the Power of Nutrition project 5 million women and children with food intervention .	-4.9834
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website : “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-8.4320
Global citizens responded : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-7.5255
Like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements ahead , we will succeed because we are more powerful together .	-2.8616
The Stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year ’ s event in New York , moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-3.6139
US could create a “ blockade ” with the Navy to impede Russian energy exports – Secretaries of the Interior – to impede Russian energy exports – with the help of the Navy .	-4.0960
Washington can “ if necessary ” resort to his marine to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke from the Washington Examiner .	-3.5973
Zinke argued that Russia ’ s involvement in Syria – particularly in the case of the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-4.6547
“ I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is this : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.3823
And according to the officials , there are ways to avoid this .	-2.8439
“ The United States has this ability , with our navy , to ensure that sea routes are open and , if necessary , to block them in order to ensure that their energy does not enter the market , ” he said .	-4.3087
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that describes itself as the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.5976
He compared Washington ’ s approach to Russia and Iran , and found that they are actually the same .	-2.7958
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less in using and replacing fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick pony " with a economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-3.2146
Opinions come while the Trump administration was at the mission to boost the export of its fluid gas to Europe , and to replace Russia , the far more favourable option for European consumers .	-4.0222
Thus , members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to put Germany to a halt to the “ inadequate ” North-Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ prisoners . ”	-3.9763
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-billion dollar pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is supposed to double existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters , is a purely economic project .	-2.8446
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.2305
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksand Novak , after a meeting with US Energy Minister Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-7.5577
The US position has given rise to backlash from Germany , which has confirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.1065
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-2.7132

Warren imposed President Donald Trump during the spray meetings , saying that he is ' leading this country in the wrong direction ' .	-4.8177
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.6332
In criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court , Warren has not taken a sheet to the mouth of candidate Brett Kavanaugh .	-6.6860
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-6.4116
But a poll published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe it should run in 2020 .	-2.4571

According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district of Washington submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) to support an asylum seekers in lawsuit .	-4.8291
The complete name of the plaintiff in the legal battle of Grace against Sessions , submitted in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Law , is unknown .	-3.7579

The lawyers of states that support Grace referred to El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which encompass a large number of asylum seekers in the US , as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-3.8665
The new US asylum policy has reversed a decision by the 2014 complaint chamber for immigrants to request asylum from undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence .	-3.1558
The Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-3.1655
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to Federal Law , all asylum applications must be judged in accordance with the circumstances of the relevant legal case and that such action violates this principle .	-5.3084
Lawyers continued to argue that the policy that denies immigrants ’ entry is damaging the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and do “ necessary work . ”	-3.6520
Prosecutor Jeff Sessions in June has instructed immigration judges not to grant asylum to persons fleeing from domestic or gang power .	-4.4439
“ Asylum belongs to those who have to leave their home country for persecution on the grounds of race , religion , nationality , or belonging to a particular social group or on the basis of political opinion , ” said Sessions in his statement on the law on 11 June .	-4.5460
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones facing people every day around the world .	-3.1498

US ambassadors are presenting China with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.7321
A week after an official Chinese newspaper presented a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper on the mutual benefit of US China trade , the US ambassador in China Beijing suggested using the American press to propaganda .	-4.9862
U.S. President Donald Trump , on Wednesday , referred to the paid accompanying China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state with the most popular Iowa newspaper - after accusing China of interfering in the US congressional elections of 6 November , which China disputes .	-5.8742
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation of interfering in US elections was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-3.1158
While it is normal for foreign states to place advertisements to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.1925
At an early stage of trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs of Chinese and US professionals should hit exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.3138
Terry Branstad , US Ambassador in China , and former Iowa governor , an important exporter of agricultural products to China , said Beijing had violated American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.3475
China , wrote in an article of opinion in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ this bullying is now vigorously running with propaganda ads in our own free press .	-4.3087
“ By disseminating propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government is exploiting its valued American tradition of freedom of expression and press , ” Branstad wrote .	-3.3900
" By contrast , at the newspaper level in Beijing ’ s streets , you will find limited voices , and see no real opposition from differing opinions that the Chinese people could have on China ’ s worrying economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-5.4507
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers contradicted the offer of publication " , even though he did not say what newspaper .	-3.1338
The Republicans bury voters before the Midterm Elections with the Kavanaugh debacle , warning analysts war.	-3.5513
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee who stands to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assaults , warning analysts that they will see a counterattack in the upcoming elections , particularly by women .	-10.3309
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-2.2935
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reeer , Professor of Politics at Syracuse University Maxwell School , in an article published by The Hill on Saturday .	-3.4634
Repeatedly , he doubted that last-minute support from Jeff Flake ( Republican MPs for the Arizona State ) will be sufficient for investigation by the FBI to reconcile angry voters .	-5.6506
“ Women are not forgotten what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant , and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.3248
On Friday morning , the demonstrators saw : “ November come ! ” while showing in the corridor of the Senate , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to go on with Kavanaughs Nomination despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , reports Mic .	-5.4829
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analysis , journalists .	-1.6431
“ People say that it has been quite advanced , that is true .	-3.5658
But the figure could be higher , especially among suburbs and younger voters , 18-29 year-olds , who may not suffer the president , but often don ’ t vote . ”	-4.2901
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she explained her allegations of sexual violence against the candidates for the Supreme Court , analysts said that a backlash could follow if Republicans pushed the candidacy .	-8.3593
“ This has become a fuzzy chaos for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , a former leader of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , according to NBC News .	-3.6849
“ It is not simply about the committee election or the closing election or whether Kavanaugh is put on the replacement bank , but about how the Republicans have done it and how they have treated it , ” Guy Cecil , US Director of Priorities , a group that helps the Democratic election , told the news station .	-6.5665
But the Americans are divided over Ford and Kavanaugh ’ s statements .	-2.7425
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of those surveyed Ford testimony definitively or probably believed , while 35 % said that they were definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh .	-4.9378
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-3.0305
On the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently examining the allegations of Ford and of at least another prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.1811
Ford said last week , before the Senate 's Justice Committee , that Kavanaugh had been attacking them at the age of 17 .	-2.9261
Ramirez accuses him of his nomination for the highest judges , during her study in Yale in the 1980 ’ s , to have blocked his genitals before her .	-7.3187

The only priest of the Church of England who received a Victoria Cross during the First World War was celebrated 100 years later in his homeland .	-3.6903
The Oberstleutnant and Reverend Bernard Vann earned the award on September 29 , 1918 at the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt .	-4.2700
But , four days later , he was killed by a shooter and did not know that he won the highest British military award .	-4.2427
A memorial stone was revealed by his two grandchildren on Saturday at a parade in Rushden , Northamtonshire .	-2.8607

The Olympic Diver Tom Daley says he has grown up with the feeling that he is subjected to all sexuality - but this gave him the motivation to become a success .	-4.7718
The 24 year-old said that he had only become aware at the secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-2.9849
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 , he told Lauren Laverne that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope ” .	-3.1042
He also said that a victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.6408
The regular presentation of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has released several months due to an illness .	-2.6619
Daley first appeared in Lavernes , saying that he felt “ less worth ” than others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-4.4607
He said : “ Up to this day , these feelings of weaner value being and difference have given me strength and strength , I needed you to be successful . ”	-5.2900

His son bears the name of his father Robert , who died in 2011 just 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-2.4533
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets still for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.0499
" I could not say to him : " Thou shalt not experience sitting in the first row , Dad ', " he said .	-3.6837

The form-weak Mickelson sat at the Bank on the Ryder Cup Saturday	-4.2310
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he will drastically improve his shape by not making a sad milestone .	-4.5771
Mickelson , who was played for the 12th time at the event which takes place every two years , was set up by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-4.1924
Instead of , as is so often the case for the United States , the five-fourth Major winner shared his day between fires and rounds of practicing on the golf course , in the hope of overcoming his low-.	-5.4725
The 48 year-old is never the most straightforward driver even at the peak of his career , and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-4.0178
And as if the space alone would not be challenging enough , in the ninth Match , Mickelson meets all four matches this week , together with New Tommy Fleetwood , for his precise blow , British Open Champion Francesco Molinari .	-5.7446
If Americans get four points behind and start the 12 individual games , Mickelson ’ s Match may be absolutely crucial .	-4.4153
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband ; however , he remained another .	-3.2563
" He understood the role he had today completely , gave me a tap on the back and put his arm around me and said that he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-7.9979
“ He has plenty of confidence .	-1.3511
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-1.9815
I probably would not have thought that he is playing two games .	-2.2298
I would have liked more , but it has now come to light and that is the way in which we believe we had to tackle it .	-5.4152
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.0741
Until now , Nick Faldo holds record over most of the matches played at the Ryder Cup , which will break on Su.	-5.1433

Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and seven times indecisive , while Furyk said that his presence would have been invaluable for the team .	-4.8835
" He is fun , he is sarcastic , fun , he loves to talk people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.5286
I think younger players had fun this week to measure with him , that was nice to see . ”	-3.0427

The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.3436
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great advance in the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an uncomfortable ride .	-4.1145
In 1997 , the Dane debuted in the game in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only scarcely reached the target line and won a thin lead from 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-5.2533

You will be absolutely ready tomorrow .	-2.5072
Go out there and do the right things .	-1.1651
The dots will not work until the dots are displayed on the panel .	-3.7671
Our goal is to win this cup , and we focus on it .	-2.4153
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we have a strong opponent to do the best players in the world . ”	-2.3223
As his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be premature .	-3.8653
Tomorrow , there is another day .	-6.4752
Tomorrow there are personal performances , and that is a different matter .	-2.9023
It 's great to be out there with a partner when things are going well , but if you are out there , your own skills as a golf player are tested .	-5.8090
This is the message you have to convey to the players : get the best out of them tomorrow .	-3.5413
Now you go over to your partner and he must do the same as you are . ”	-4.6545
Unlike Björn , the opposing player , Jim Furyk , will strive for his players to perform better individually than they do as partners , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have taken care of three of four points .	-8.7629
Furyk himself already experienced such a sensational turn at the end of the day , when he was part of the winner team in Brookline , now belonging to the losers after the European team completed the “ miracle of Medinach ” .	-5.3802
" I remember every condemned word , " he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players along the way in the last day .	-3.7252
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get rid of as soon as possible , as we have seen in Brookline , in Medinear .	-4.0836
For the first time an actual dynamic has developed , the big pressure is put on the medium matches .	-5.4187
We built our composition accordingly and brought out the boys as we felt , you know that we are trying to make something special tomorrow . ”	-4.0094
Thomas , together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood , and Ian Poulter , should lead the other Europeans at the top places in the ranking , the fight against Rory McIlroy in top play .	-5.4043
I set up this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole path , " Bjorn said about his individual selection .	-3.2049
Removing the timetable for Germany ’ s new war ship	-2.1136
The German navy ’ s newest fregate should have been in service in 2014 to replace the years of the Cold War ’ s war vessels that had come from the Cold War , owing to incorrect systems and escalating costs , it is now expected to last at least until next year .	-7.7108
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland Palace ” , the chief of the brand new Fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ The Time ” on the basis of a military speaker .	-7.8282
The Marine should have started in 2014 , but serious problems after the first supply burdened the ambitious project .	-3.6631
The four boats ordered by the navy in the Baden-Württemberg class in 2007 will replace the older boats in the Bremen class .	-3.5713
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a number of aerospace and ship-defense missiles , as well as some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.5246
Another important advantage is longer-term maintenance intervals : the latest fregates should be able to operate for up to two years without running the home port .	-6.3258
But the state-of-the-art warships that are supposed to facilitate an overseas power projection will already be outdated by the constant delays if they are finally in service , as the weekly newspaper “ The Time ” notes .	-5.4669
The unfortunate F125 freegatte produced headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.5590
This was the first time that after the delivery , the navy returned a ship to a ship crew .	-3.8885
Little known about the reasons for the return of the vessels ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the vessel useless in combat operations .	-4.8452
Software defects were particularly important as the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are used by an occupation of around 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older brakes .	-4.4289
It also turned out that the ship has a considerable weight , which would limit performance and make future upgrades more difficult for the navy .	-5.5687
It is estimated that the 7,000-ton Rhineland-Palatinate is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II .	-3.8120
In addition to flawed hardware , the pricing signal of the entire project - including the training of crew - is also available on the topic .	-4.9684
Instead of the initially estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the costs now seem to have reached the dwindling level of EUR 3.1 billion ( about $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.5304
The problems with the newest bullets are particularly important in the light of recent warnings about Germany ’ s naval power disappears .	-5.9214
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defense Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the fleet actually had ‘ the ships that are capable of being deployed ’ .	-4.3261
The officer said that the problem has grown in the course of time , as old ships have been discharged without replacing it .	-4.4148
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregates were serviced by the Marine .	-3.5785

This information will help to determine the advantages of habitat management of how meadows are best preserved and how the forests for flowers and other associated species are to be preserved .	-5.2091
In the case of Fledermaus populations in Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom , there has been a major decline in the last hundred years .	-4.8135

Also wind turbines and illumination can be a risk , as well as fly tires and some chemical treatments of building materials , and domestic catatt.	-6.1568
Bats are not blind actually .	-2.0936
According to their night-time hunting activities , the ears are more useful than the eyes when fishing a bag .	-4.4778
They use a sophisticated echo order technique to locate errors and obstacles in their flight paths .	-4.1565
The NTS , which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , is taking the bats very seriously .	-4.4112
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes make rescues .	-2.8605
The organization has even established Scotland 's first and only dedicated stock reserve in the Threade Property in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish Fledermouse species are home .	-5.0671
According to David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-1.9767
“ Here in Threave we have a fantastic area for bats . ”	-3.8234
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good habitat .	-1.9902
But there is still a lot of unknown about mowers and the work that we are doing here and elsewhere helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-4.4076
He stresses that it is important to check , before maintenance work in buildings , whether there are batteries there , according to which it is possible that , if a single sleep area is destroyed , a whole local population may be wiped out .	-8.4273
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass , or disrupt them and destroy their sleeping places .	-3.2533
Elisabeth Ferrell , a Scottish member of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-7.5355
She said , “ We still have a lot to learn about our slaughter and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-3.8516

Brexit : Britain would regret losing car manufacturers forever .	-1.6535
“ The United Kingdom would regret time for Brexit to lose its position as the world ’ s leading automobile manufacturer , ” said Economic Minister Greg Clark .	-4.2616
He added that it is ' worrying ' that Toyota UK had told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at its factory in Burnaston , close to Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.7182
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-0.6506
The Japanese automobile manufacturer said that the impact of delays on borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-4.0544
The work in Burnaston produced by the brands Auris and Avensis for Toyota produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.1375
“ When the UK leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think it will come to our production stop , ” said Marvin Cooke , Chairman of the Executive Board at Toyota in Burna.	-4.6684
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without any agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW , and Jaguar Land Rover .	-8.3677
BMW , for example , has already announced that his work in Oxford will be closing for a month after Brexit .	-2.6784
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-2.8636
Toyota production facilities are based on customer-oriented manufacturing , i.e. , the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by UK and EU suppliers for special products .	-4.1754
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays on the border that , according to industry , could lead to supply shortages and partial scarcity .	-4.1310
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock in its plant in Derbyshire , said the company , and so production would be stopped .	-3.4988
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU was ‘ exactly calibrated in order to avoid these checks at the border ’ .	-3.2687
We need to have a deal , we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed today , we want to take that opportunity , ” he said to the Today of BBC Radio 4 .	-4.2527
“ The reference not only of Toyota , but also of other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-3.6923
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stop might last , but warned that the cost increase in the plant would suffer in the long term and that jobs could eventually be lost .	-5.4155
Peter Tsouvalaris , trade union representatives , and for 24 years in Burnaston , said that trade union members were increasingly worried : “ My experience is forever lost jobs as soon as they were dismantled . ”	-4.7140

Trump ’ s meeting with Rosenstein could be postponed again , says the White House	-1.9624
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meetings with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be ' postponed a week ' because the battle over the Supreme Court candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , read the White House on Sunday .	-4.7348
Rosenstein supervises the work of the Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who investigates Russian interventions in the elections , links between Trump and Russia , and possible obstruction by the president .	-3.8979
Whether Trump will fire or not the Deputy Prosecutor , and thus jeopardizing Müller ’ s independence , Washington has been a lot of track for months .	-4.8310
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the wearing of a cable in order to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th constitutional addition .	-3.7251
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.4901
But last Monday , he went to the White House , whereas reports were hailed that he was on the brink of resignation .	-4.3858
Instead , a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York was announced on Thursday .	-2.0509
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the session was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , accused of sexual misconduct .	-12.1308
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh , and continued to delay a full senate vote .	-3.3813
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman Sarah Sanders was on Sunday at Fox News .	-1.9226
She said after the Rosenstein meeting , " A deadline for this has not yet been fixed , it could be this week , I could see that I postponed another week , given all the other things that go before the Supreme Court .	-9.4228
But we will see and I keep the press up to date ' .	-1.8801
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders did not hold a White House press conference since 10 September .	-2.3612
Guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.5926
Sanders said that the lack of letters did not affect the propensity of television reporters who were behaving like self-starters , but also said : ' I will not be against them in the gallery ' .	-6.5748
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.2773
" The President performs more questions and answers than any President said in front of him , " she said and added , without mentioning proof : " We have looked at these figures . " .	-8.8654
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but if the press has the opportunity to ask the questions directly to the President of the United States , that is infinitely better than to speak to her .	-4.2877
We are trying to do much of that and you have seen how we have done that in recent weeks , and it will replace a press discussion if you can speak to the President of the United States itself . ”	-4.3756
Trump answers questions regularly when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.4094
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-0.9004
In New York , the President perhaps showed this week why he made a freelance and sometimes bizarre appearance of assembled reporters .	-3.5330

Milk pump advertising , which compares mothers with cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-2.2502
A milk pump company has caused controversial online discussions because of an ad where breastfeeding mothers are compared with milk cows . to . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.2128
On the occasion of the market introduction of the supposedly " world 's first noisy and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-5.0111
Four real mothers dance in a hay in the middle of cows to a number with the following song text : " Yes , I milk me , but you see no cock " and " If you have not noticed that there are no euters , they are my breasts . "	-5.3907
The slogan continues : ' pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump , I milk my lamps ' .	-7.9770
However , the display published on the facebook page of the company has made online controversy .	-3.3249
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video received mixed reactions from the spectators , many of whom say it lit the " horrors " of the dairy economy .	-8.3939
" It is a very bad decision to use cows for this product . "	-2.4140
Like we must also become pregnant and bore to produce milk , except that they are taken away their babies within just a few days of birth , " a person wrote .	-3.8092
The Elvie Milchpump is constantly adjusted to a Still BH ( Elvie / Mutter ) .	-7.6005
Another comment : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.6547
Yes , why should we not advertise with them a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.8117
Someone else added : ' Such an outer advertisement ' .	-2.9460
Others defended advertising , including a woman who confessed that she found the song “ urcomic ” .	-2.8363
I think that is a great idea .	-1.2620
I would have received one if I had stilled .	-3.2144
I felt like a cow through the pump .	-1.4597
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.0311
This is a brilliant product " , wrote a person .	-1.8825
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertising for mothers who feel pumped ( often in their jobs or toilets ) and like ' cows ' .	-3.8463
This is not advertising which praises or judges the dairy economy ' .	-2.6149
At the end of the video the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the dark pumps in their BHs .	-3.8425
The campaign ’ s concept is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows .	-2.7451
The Elvie Pump is noisy , however , has no wires or hoses and fits inexorably into a stylish B , allowing women to move , keep their babies , and even go pump .	-5.9852
Ana Balarin , Partner and ECD commented on Mother : " The Elvie Pump is such a revolutionary product that has earned a courageous and provocative market launch . , , . , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.5182

Hundreds of migrant children drag quiet into a tent camp on the Texas border .	-2.1347
The number of children imprisoned with migratory background , even though the monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , partly because the hard rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-4.8677
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants , and fear that they will risk referring the country to a child .	-3.2440
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprints and that data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-3.1481
Last week , Matthew Albence , a high official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-3.4399
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of the detainees had no former criminal records .	-7.8950
" Almost 80 percent of people who are either sponsors or household members are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens .	-3.4861
" We are following these people , " Albence said .	-2.8415

Those who do not call into question discharge are quickly deferred .	-2.9055
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they are frightened or depressed , which can lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape .	-3.6842
Advocates said that these concerns were reinforced in a larger body such as Tornillo , where signs that a child has to fight are more likely to be overlooked because of its size .	-5.0366
They added that moving children into the tent city without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to adopt friends could worsen a dream that many are already fighting .	-4.4318

Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that the foreign forces were illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it ” .	-3.6517
“ You must withdraw immediately , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.4249
Moualem claimed that Syria ’ s “ war on terror is almost over . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , millions more have been driven out of their homes .	-3.0080
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-2.7840
The US has some 2,000 troops in Syria ; primarily schools and advises both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-2.7343
France has more than 1,000 soil soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.2635
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for returning are ok , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears , ” leading refugees to keep away .	-4.2287
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” said Moualem .	-6.9671
“ You politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-1.5456
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid to Syria if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition over an end to war .	-3.9475
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last important Rebel Council of Idlib creates an opportunity to push political talks forward .	-4.6186
The Russian-Turkish Deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russia supported Syrian troops on the province in which three million people live .	-2.6205
Moualem , however , stressed that the agreement provides “ clear deadlines , ” and he hopes that military action will be directed against jihadists , among other things against fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda , which will “ eliminate ” .	-9.5242
UN Representative Staffan de Mistura hopes that the first meeting of a new committee of government and opposition members will be called upon to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and to pave the way for elections .	-3.9736

He outlined for the jury how he compiled the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinton Tellis and the 19-year-old sacrifice of Jessica Chamber at night with mobile records .	-5.1386

FBI investigations have begun , and board Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-2.5504
“ I thought , if we could actually get something like what he was asking for - an investigation that is limited in time and scale - we could perhaps reach a little consensus , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday , and added that he feared that the committee would “ fall apart in the midst of a deep-rooted party political blockade . ”	-7.4559
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to identify ?	-1.6731
Their reluctance is simply due to the timing .	-10.1125

Pyongyang did not speak publicly .	-1.8323

Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953 .	-2.4459
Most are fleeing over China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarised zone between North and South Korea .	-7.0664

Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as hysterical and says he is unsuitable for the Supreme Court service .	-3.6389
The leader of the democratic minority group , Nancy Pelosi , named Brett Kavanaugh , the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court , “ hysterically ” and said that he was incapable of serving the Supreme Court by temperament .	-4.0754
Pelos made the comments on an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-2.2458
“ I could not think otherwise that if a woman had ever behaved , they would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her reaction to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Committee on Thursday .	-4.5159
Kavanaugh emotionally denounced the allegations that he had sexually attacked Dr. Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young people .	-3.4134
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he wrote almost and fighted with tears when talking about his family and his high-school years .	-3.2454
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated reputation campaign ” organized by Liberals , who are angry about Clinton losing the presidential election in 2016 .	-3.1454
Pelos said that she believed that Kavanaughs had proved that he could not serve before the Supreme Court , because he showed that he was against democrats .	-4.7381
“ I believe that he disqualified himself with such statements and the way in which he can be affected by the Clintons and the Democrats , ” she said .	-2.9817
When asked whether it would seek an official recovery proceedings against Kavanaugh in the event of its confirmation and democratic majority in the House of Representatives , Pelos del.	-5.7179
" I shall say this : if he does not say the truth to the Congress or the FBI , he is not only incapable of serving the Supreme Court , but also of serving the court on which he is currently employed , " he said .	-5.1966
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. appeal court .	-1.8622
Pelos added that she , as a democrat , worried about possible rulings against the affordable Care Act or Roe v. , as he stands for conservative justice .	-4.4452
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh diverted questions as to whether he would kill certain decisions by the Supreme Court .	-4.6246
“ It is not time for a person who is hysterical , prejudiced to go to court and expects us to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” Pelosi said .	-5.2561
And women must live up to it .	-2.2643
It is a genuine speech , months and years full of anger , and it cannot rush it without crying .	-4.7043
" We cry when we become angry , " Mrs Steiner said to me 45 years later .	-3.7256
" I do not think that this is unusual , or ? "	-1.9542
She continued : “ I once helped a woman in the executive who told me that she was also crying when she was angry , but she developed a technique whereby she every time she was angry and started to cry , to the person with whom she spoke , saying : “ You may think that I am sad because I wine .	-5.9990
I am angry . '	-1.6804
Then she simply did .	-2.4294
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.0393
Tars are permitted as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-2.5158
One of my strongest memories of an early job in a male dominated office where I once went with unscheduled anger was that I was packed by an elderly woman at the neck , an eye-catching manager before which I was always scared - who put me in a staircase .	-7.7963

It was a lost battle .	-0.9196
She noted that some of her supporters , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give her only $ 250 .	-2.5473
“ Think of those I get pre-alcohol ? ” she wondered .	-5.3538
When she gave her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people who had supported her in frustrating the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address voters instead of delegates , and anger about sexism - that she was smothered .	-5.0450

The US and China ’ s opening salves of the US-China trade war were rewarding , and an end to the conflict is not in sight ; a gap between the two countries can be beneficial for Beijing in the long term , say experts .	-5.6243

China answers every blow from the US with one counterattack , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second largest economy will succeed in the near future .	-4.0692
Bringing Washington to mind means giving in to the demands of being publicly bought before the United States would be far too blamble to Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-6.3136
But , if Beijing is using its chances properly , the trade war with the US can , in the long run , have a positive effect on China by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies , say experts .	-5.2740
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , scientific staff at the Center for New American Security , a think tank with Asia ’ s focus .	-3.6581
