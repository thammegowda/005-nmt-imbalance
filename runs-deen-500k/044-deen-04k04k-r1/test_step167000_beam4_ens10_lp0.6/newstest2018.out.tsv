Munich 1856 : four cards that change your view over the city .	-2.5707
This is a mistake in which young people are to meet today .	-8.0300
A cabin now digging for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-3.6282
Small gardens manage the former cause of farmers .	-3.8583
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories .	-1.5888
It nervt if maps are not current .	-1.8609
Everyone who had to get excited about this , because the car navi showed a green meadow rather than .	-4.5985
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the state government , are far from up to date - but that is precisely why it is very interesting .	-5.4641
Especially if you compare it with current online cards .	-2.3512
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the nineteenth century in the sphere of Munich Merk.	-6.6763
The digital Bavarian atlas is a patchwork that you don 't recognize equally as such .	-4.0718
The large map has been incorporated into more detailed maps for towns and municipalities , so-called urposition sheets .	-4.2292
They were created according to the Bayerische Measurement Management ( Bavaria ) between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first measurement of Bavaria .	-6.3306
Your customer : Napoleon .	-1.1066
The French army leader , Bavaria , occupied with Austria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War .	-2.4563
Napoleon wished to see the occupied country and commissioned a topographical inclusion of Bavaria , for military purposes of course .	-3.5882
Although the French troops finally withdrew from the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , today 's neighbours created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card .	-4.6271
Shortly Max IV. Joseph further promoted the project , founded the Topographic Bureau - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Management .	-4.8763
The Bavarian National Library is one of the largest provinces in the world .	-6.1731
The comparison of the former and present is most impressive with the example of the capital .	-4.9353
The city has grown into all directions and has grown together .	-2.7762
An example of this is undersendling , which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .	-3.0697
Sendling was inaugurated 21 years after the card was created , i.e. in 187.	-7.0626
Today , Untersendling is in the middle of the city .	-5.3915
The houses Untersendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plingan road , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasant uprising against Austria in 1705 .	-5.4655
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing as fields - at first sight : a smaller card with dozens of lines and figures : handwritten pieces of the so-called " original " from which the property tax was derived .	-6.7442
Small parcels are no longer a farmer , but a small garden of the " Land in Sun " facility .	-5.2872
A large green area stands north from substation .	-3.6890
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the Oktoberfest site , was in fact still a meadow in the nineteenth century , and not a concrete desert .	-4.8551
On the other hand , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-1.9355
In the area of the present district Au-Haidhausen you can read not only the name of the street " am Gasteig " or the hill " On the Lufts " , but also in large letters " Irren Antalt " .	-5.5207
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstrasse you once barred people with madness .	-3.2780
In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Irrenstalt " On the Auer Lüften " was created .	-5.4623
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-3.5007
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the anquette of so-called errors .	-3.9669
In addition , he has prohibited the staff from using violence against the inmates , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the Institute .	-5.0406
The first room was for 280 patients and then extended to 500 places .	-3.3062
At some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circular organisation in Haar 1905 .	-3.8838
Since 2006 , Isar Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of the largest psychiatrics in Germany .	-4.0951
On the area of the former Auer Anstalt , young people are now encountering Salesianum in Munich .	-4.0052
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a Youth Hostel with educational facilities .	-5.6657
To the west lies the football pitch of the TSV Munich East , eastern residential buildings of the 1980s .	-3.6559
In 2015 , the Children ’ s House , Casa Don Bosco , was erected in an architectural approach to the origin of the Irren Institute , which had been destroyed during World War II in bombing .	-8.4046
Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as the " Hauptplatz " , the shopping street was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-5.4799
A major change was made by the Second World War in the heart of Munich .	-2.5886
The Allied bombs flow into the city centre in December 1944 .	-2.8619
A great stay still today - at the Marienhof .	-3.7597
The English Institute , small houses and a small band from the Middle Ages were once stood at the Marienhof , where the preliminary works and on 5 April 2017 the Spatent Table were held for the second S-Bahn route .	-7.6489
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with today 's aviation picture - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-3.6763
Travel warning for Missouri CitGroup	-2.7139
The National Association for Farbing has issued a warning for colourful people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory policy and racist attacks by the state .	-4.3639
" The NACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and missources to raise special attention when travelling by the state and exercise extreme caution , because a number of questionable , race-based incidents have recently occurred in the whole state and are noted here in the group 's opinion .	-7.3517
A recent Missouri law , which makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination , as well as the state ’ s criminal enforcement agencies , which aim disproportionately at minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , said the NACP .	-5.3145
" You have violations of civil rights that people happen .	-2.8672
They are stopped for their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said Missouri NACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-3.8160
'We are hearing complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . '	-2.0346
It is the first such warning that the organization of a state in the US has issued .	-2.1906
The group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.2806
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no fuel during the state ’ s journey and was arrested by Missouri ’ s police , without being accused of being criminal .	-5.2305
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri General Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are being held 75 % more frequently than white .	-3.7786
" The recommendation is that people are aware of what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.5308
" People must be prepared , whether they bring cheating money or let relatives know that they are travelling through the state . "	-4.7520
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI hate report , which classified the state in relation to the number of such injuries at the 16th rank of the country .	-4.0776
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company due to housing or employment discrimination .	-2.9769
Prior to this , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the Member States had adopted immigration laws obliging local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for infringements of immigration , which , in the view of ACLU , will contribute to further race profiling .	-4.5463
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-13.1339
Wide zaur project is elementary .	-4.3176
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.0911
The Peter White and Kordula Kovac CDU MEPs have got a picture on the spot .	-4.5768
At the Rightgrabenhof the Schwenembann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU-Loctsverband met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-4.9173
Markus Schwanembann initially gave insights into his business , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 milk cows and as many boys , and hosted holiday guests in five apartments .	-5.2787
For him the " Black Forest milk " is the alternative route for the milk of his cows , said Schwannemann .	-4.9094
On the table of the holiday guests is exclusively regional .	-4.6239
He is also Chairman of the BLHV of Fischerbach , and he described the pastoral project as " essential " .	-4.4756
I cannot make profitable economies in such steep areas .	-8.3859
The greenland area provides a lot of work and a lot of engine sensitivity needs to be processed .	-5.1635
" We have here the conditions and the topography to fight , " said Schwenembann .	-3.9850
In 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not run a biofuel .	-4.8506
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the pastoral project and is glad about leader promotion " .	-4.4443
For the costs of EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-3.0957
It is hoped that the afforestation of the surfaces could be extended for a while .	-5.4766
" The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they move on to their farm , " the mayor stressed .	-4.0245
Farmers are often criticised for promoting them .	-2.5371
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were incorporated into the grassroots extraction .	-5.0802
The open area is 40 hectares , which must not be forecast until at least 2023 .	-5.0032
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted over Leader , a quarter wore the town of Fischerbach .	-3.3577
That leaves farmers EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture .	-3.3928
" The big advantage is the durability of the fences " , said Schwennemann .	-3.0090
Kordula Kovac stressed : ' You do a good job without farmers and farmers ' .	-3.2040
Peter White also stated : ' Here the best food is produced ' .	-3.0885
The Landscape Relations Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg allows state support for wheat fences .	-3.8803
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.4039
A funding background referred to by the LPR is required .	-4.1523
Moreover , the land into which it should be irmanageable cannot be slipper ( approx . 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by the afforestation .	-7.4640
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaun project 2018 , the application of eight participants with 24 plots that want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence is under way .	-4.8791
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are over 112 000 euros .	-3.3099
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.4798
Now the Trump White House is adopting the Statue for Freedom	-2.5834
The safest sign of regime change is to start attacking statues .	-1.9486
Americans appreciate this as much as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.9946
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated contest with Jim Acosta of CNN on President 's proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration with a status of freedom .	-4.3647
Miller did not attack the statue itself to stay fair .	-1.8585
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-3.0738
But he attacked its importance , and in particular the importance it attributed , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , his basis .	-4.2662
As Miller Acosta said , " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the status of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world .	-4.4390
The poem to which you refer later added is not part of the original status of freedom . '	-2.8109
Miller is right , but as he himself has put it , it is not really about history .	-2.5859
It is about the contemporary resonance to Lazarus 's bitter words , the only one in which a state not only invites old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mothers , your arms , / your afflicted crowds , who seek to breathe freely / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-7.6291
There was never a time when " missing waste " was better on our screens .	-2.3743
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6152
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural conflict : it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America .	-3.2422
Lazarus - and their friends who advocated placing their words on the basis of their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act .	-4.3719
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism , representing the female embodiment of freedom in a classic picture that has been scrapped .	-5.1960
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she received one voice .	-2.8037
And she gives herself another name : Mother of Exilants .	-3.0563
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-1.7616
And just as Lazarus changed the significance of the statue , people on the right wanted to change it long ago .	-3.5370
The great cry Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue for Freedom was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative , bringing the American flame to the murdered world : ' Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.9808
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States into the rest of the world .	-2.4353
The flag is not supposed to illuminate the way into the United States ' .	-2.8021
Limbaugh was somewhat unusual in this respect .	-4.1134
The importance of the statue is quite a question of the point of view .	-2.4782
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see it as it was seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys to the vessels .	-5.2608
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.0625
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .	-2.5390
And that , of course , is not the prospect that Miller and Trump would ever like to acknowledge .	-2.9387
Their flag should not erode the way , but ignite the hatred that is its only source of power .	-3.6470
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the team of Britain .	-1.8675
Eilidh Doyle reminds of a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-2.2810
The Director of the UK ’ s light athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championship cader will make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-4.5209
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which will start on Friday .	-2.3552
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and the UK 's athletics must learn something from it .	-3.4978
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , " said Black .	-2.5784
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has to do with what they have done .	-2.2225
The Scottish athletes think it has to do with what they have done .	-1.7918
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-1.7007
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.7416
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.1664
Several of the Scottish athletes are medals , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who are going against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain .	-4.9666
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.3961
Your Captain 's speech was incredible ' , says Black .	-2.0793
" A series of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they were living or training , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-3.1491
The passion and the real feeling , which of course brought Eilidh , were great . '	-3.3554
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who is going through the 400-meter hurdles at their fifth World Championship , says it is ' incredible ' that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.6453
Scotland ’ s best total of athletes at the World Cup has been seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.4388
Muir 's fund runs along this path and established five British and two European records last year .	-4.6027
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of runs .	-3.0863
Chris O 'Hare , which runs 1,500 metres , is another Scottish that should be observed after a great season that won the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-3.8537
Doyle reminds of her first world champions , when he was the only other Scot at the Team Lee McConnell .	-3.8615
The team captain says that they are " enormously proud " to the fact that many of their compatriots will not only belong to the team , but in some cases will also be involved in the medals and the finals .	-4.8003
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , it makes it a very special thing for me " , she added .	-5.3206
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team .	-1.2484
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.0545
And they are here as established athletes , athletes that want to climb to Podien .	-2.9244
What I am talking about as a captain ?	-2.3047
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.1158
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , as we have a World Cup .	-3.2653
So it is really important to rely on this home-support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.0784
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.4417
Block critics about Facebook : Do not raise a public office if you cannot afford voter heating .	-4.7838
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.2680
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-3.1921
He showed criticism , secret .	-3.6786
But he has not silenced his critics .	-0.6162
Because in 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be removed - and , stupid and stupid , we are being slaughtered like the sheep ' .	-3.4198
This brings me to Maryland Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-1.9941
Hogan ’ s staff blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on its official Facebook page .	-3.3397
That is why the American Civil Liberties Union sued him earlier this week .	-2.2586
The staff of the governor sacked the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.7181
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-1.7014
But it is important .	-1.0946
And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan .	-2.9768
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is surprisingly popular .	-1.9494
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.0340
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-0.9000
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and stringent respect for principles .	-5.7467
He was also very skillful to use Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and playing his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-3.8556
That is why the blocking of people coming to the governor side - which is a public forum that is called official and unnecessary and ultimately dangerous by staff paying under public tax dollars .	-5.7513
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-2.2583
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the plague online .	-3.7748
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-1.3043
And these are only true people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a parish , not a troll .	-3.3618
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profitable .	-1.8361
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-1.9000
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hated , but she asked for hate crimes .	-2.7246
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the news " The Post " .	-4.0936
" I do not appreciate this idea when a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some people disregard it rather than a so-called collective use and do not recognise it as a large group of affected citizens ' .	-6.3574
What governor ’ s officials called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ advocacy . ”	-4.2416
The Facebook era makes it easy to navigate a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-8.4061
It is much cleaner than in earlier times if one had done the same , that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-11.2384
But that is exactly what happens in digital terms .	-2.1178
Hogan is not the first public civil servant to be criticised for appealing Facebook and other social media .	-3.0297
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.6747
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-1.3850
The Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment , according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-4.3874
And in Kentucky governor Matt Bevin ( R ) received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.7703
That should not be so difficult .	-2.1641
Currently , Washington 's era of affordable porto had a similar effect as the Internet .	-3.4421
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters suggested his leadership .	-1.9221
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-0.9977
The people using pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " , wrote all the letters to newspapers that wrote Washington 's decisions .	-3.7414
Petitions criticising his position on the Treaty of Amity , Trade and Shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by George Washington Project ’ s online papers .	-3.2167
But he did not silence them .	-1.2532
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation .	-2.7976
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.4999
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club .	-1.8924

Less cancer deaths from passive smoking	-1.0531
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer because of passive smoking .	-2.3904
The result is a study by scientists at the University Clinic Hamburg Eppendorf ( UKE ) .	-3.3371
" According to our estimates , 167 cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , " said Heiko Becher .	-3.2512
He made a comparison with his own study of the 1994 issue .	-2.2864
At that time , 400 lung cancer deaths were in Germany for passive smoking per year .	-3.4943

In its wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai Region in the disturbing Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually has a sweet potato - locally called " nota " - directly to the fireplace .	-4.7775
After half an hour the clouded cloud is taken from and swallowed hands .	-5.2093
Degei is sitting on the grounds - she doesn 't have any furniture - where she also performs her daily work , such as clothing with bleak water from the nearby swamp .	-5.5001
A buckle in a dachless room serves as a latrine .	-3.9221
She was not assigned a field as the youngest of the four wives of her husband .	-4.1813
Polygamy is common here .	-1.9497
Of course , late work can be dangerous : most of the villagers are unemployed , and many drink hard , and there are soldiers here .	-3.0462
" No one dares to walk around after 5 p.m. in the village , " she says .	-2.3800
It is a rare insight into the daily life of Papua , a former Dutch colony that was admitted in 1969 after a controversial referendum in Indonesia , when only 1,026 elders were supposed to vote by public handling before the occupying forces .	-4.7869
An existing movement , which stirred independence against Dutch rule , quickly turned against the government of Jakarta , which maintains control of the region , and prevents foreign journalists or legal observers from doing so .	-4.0799
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent part of Papua New Guinea comprising the eastern part of the island .	-2.6251
Enarotali is as busy as it is , and the journey includes a 90-minute flight from the provincial capital of Jayapura to Nabire and then a 5-hour car journey with the rental car .	-5.6739
There is no public transport system .	-1.5870
The city with approximately 19,000 inhabitants consists of wooden houses surrounded by bamboo fences and splendid roofs converted into various yellow brown tones by rose .	-5.1767
Just a few Indonesians have tried here , let alone journalists and practically no foreigners .	-2.6557
Before Christian missionaries arrived , Mee Pago Papuans worshipped a God called Uga Tamee .	-2.1508
There were other changes as well .	-1.2314
" We were not accustomed to wearing this clothing " , says Degei and points to her lively , handwoven Turban , her dark shirt , and her bright rock .	-4.1309
'Previously we only had leaves at our bodies . '	-2.4055
Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and have some of the worst infant mortality and alphabetization rates in Asia .	-2.8091
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland .	-1.1983
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is only 60 miles from Paniai , a high country province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-3.6403
In 2015 alone , freeports accounted for $ 3.1 billion of gold and copper .	-2.3534
In addition , Papua has wood resources worth an estimated $ 78 billion .	-2.7169
But these wealth are a source of misery for the Papua , which ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military presence is smothering .	-3.3301
An investigation in 2005 at the New York Times reported that freeport paid nearly $ 20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including as much as $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.5272
Papuan calls for greater autonomy threaten these golden gans and are treated with mercy .	-2.6571
According to activists , more than 500,000 Papua have been killed , and thousands have been raped , tortured , and imprisoned by the Indonesian military since 1969 .	-1.9436
Mass killings in Papua ’ s tribal country in the 1970 ’ s became genocide in accordance with the Asian Commission on Human Rights .	-3.8407
In the region alone , the Indonesian police arrested more than 3,900 peaceful demonstrators last year .	-1.5249
" We are going to lose all " , as stated in a report by the Brisbane Archdiocese of 2016 containing reports on atrocities of the previous year , such as illegal executions and torture - rape and electric strikes are particularly popular after another report - and the brutal denunciation of peaceful demonstrations .	-6.1573
" It is difficult to count the number of victims as events occur every week , " says Andreas Harsono , Indonesia researcher for Human Rights Watch .	-6.5511
The screws have intensified , as Papua ’ s resources bring an influx of settlers from other parts of Indonesia .	-3.1981
The population of 3.5 million inhabitants of the province is 83 % Christian , but demographic development is changing , as Muslim economic migrants come from the populous islands of Java , Borneo , Sumatra and Sulawesi .	-6.4774
Javanese warning cantines sell used chicken and gado gado , serving mixed vegetables with natural nutsauce .	-4.9186
Local people struggle to keep up here .	-1.8733
" The migrants have begun to sell chickens and vegetables on the traditional market cheaper than the local papua , " says Abeth You , a 24-year-old Paniai locals who moved to the provincial capital of Jayapura .	-3.9559
" It cost the indigenous Papua - the Mama [ the women ] of Papua - their market . "	-3.5303
The Indonesian Prime Minister Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi in popular life , promised to address inequalities and infringements in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .	-3.7378
The former room secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - along the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.2625
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel fraud .	-3.5603
" Our hearts are broken because we voted for Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " you say .	-2.9215
Indeed , just two months after Jokovi ’ s inauguration in October , Paniai suffered a low point .	-3.5714
On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children out , sang Christmas songs before a warehouse in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-3.2101
The frightened children told them that they should turn on their spotlight .	-3.6261
One of the soldiers took impetus at their tone and later came back with four soldiers , such as the local pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-3.8054
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their clothes , said victims and witnesses .	-2.8395
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.4058
A child 16 years old Yulianus Yeimo was so hard beaten that he fell into the coma .	-2.5552
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was put in fire and things were escalated the next day .	-3.1823
About 1,000 young Papua men , women and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-3.4484
They wore ceremonial hunting bags and introduced the Waita dance - continuously in circle and imitating a bird 's angle - by Papuas Mee Pago strain .	-5.0822
Some protesters began to scrap stones on police and military posts .	-2.6568
When the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command about an internal radio : " If the masses do more than three times resistance , they shoot dead " , says in an official TIME document that was not released to the local media .	-9.8812
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kogo Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat and called for calm and called for the amount to return home .	-4.2827
Nobody was listening in the mood .	-1.2400
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left hand gear , " he said TIME at the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.7621
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-2.8231
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-2.4270
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-3.0158
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesians , wears only one name , the TIME in gloomy mood .	-4.0067
" I saw that he was dead ... I kissed him . "	-1.7022
The leader of the Papua police , Yotje Mende , said that his officers wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-4.2037
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the spokesman of the Papua police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.7785
'It is about life and death . '	-0.9042
According to Human Rights Watch , five young demonstrators were killed and many more were injured .	-1.4816
The news of the killings came only the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta .	-2.1696
Three weeks , Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura in which he expressed sympathy for the families of the victims and swore to tackle the historical grievances in Papua .	-3.3939
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will not happen again in the future , " he said .	-2.4405
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical violations of human rights .	-2.4573
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.1130
" Most injuries occurred long ago .	-1.7066
Some were in the 1990 ’ s and early the 2000 ’ s .	-7.4988
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements , but there are processes that must be carried out " he said .	-3.1585
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on 5 June in Jakarta and said that he had no plans to set up a complaints mechanism in Papua .	-3.2668
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-1.6449
Wiranto , which charged the UN for ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-3.9685
Families of the Paniai victims objected to such claims with grave disbelief .	-4.5012
" I was interviewed four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.5454
'I am tired . '	-1.3381
He says that he is still living in fear years later .	-2.5889
" I fear " he says .	-1.9978
" I fear being arrested by the military , fear of being shot . "	-2.2282
His brother Yacobus reiterated the view that people in Paniai fear to discuss the incident .	-2.8959
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims .	-1.8210
" After burying the bodies , the military searched for me " , he says .	-2.7132
Shooters have not stopped .	-1.0814
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot at village residents in Paniai ’ s neighborhood Deiyai .	-3.0018
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring an unconscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.4742
The man who died 24 years old Ravianus Douw , who was drowning when he fished in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .	-3.9738
Vocational villagers protested at the company 's location office .	-3.7371
The police said that the villagers thrown stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .	-9.2238
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot and killed a crowd .	-6.6072
" We were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , living near the hospital and witnessing how the injured here quickly was delivered , according to TIME .	-5.0047
'I hidden myself two days in my house ' .	-2.9055
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be accountable and to withdraw the mobile brigade of the police from the area .	-7.8454
Paniai has always been a source of unrest to the Indonesian Government . , , .	-5.8366
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribal members of the sea , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the green Papua Highlands .	-4.3977
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) in defending the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.0949
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-2.0265
In response to this , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested in recent years , under the pretext of ' ensuring national sovereignty ' .	-3.1243
Some people never dive again .	-2.2992
Among the people in Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic forgotten place " .	-2.7947
Poverty is reinforcing discontent .	-1.4836
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.8883
Bread is just as bad as it is .	-2.3557
People here are building everything they eat : nota and fruit and sheep .	-3.0652
Agriculture is the task of women , who can handle four or five fields of sweet potato each .	-7.4656
They maintain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest are sold on the local market .	-2.7575
Ten Nota pieces cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.4025
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the domestic Papua and the new migrants that have reached greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabir Airport .	-4.2325
The few jobs in the region typically go to the more educated and prosperous migrants .	-2.8139
Papua rarely have the capital or the necessary skills to make its own businesses competitive .	-3.0204
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , " says John Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai .	-2.9498
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world outside of Papua .	-2.3057
Moreover , restrictions on reporting international media remain tense .	-2.1745
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , though they were rarely permitted to film .	-3.1576
According to Phelim Kine , the deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowi ’ s campaign promises to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been realised .	-3.7982
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's worrying eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.3715
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government largely remains limited to immediate neighbours of Papua .	-2.8734
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai chief .	-3.2383
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.9742
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the allegations of the group and said journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there is free media , so it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.4373
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.7740
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the Human Rights Representative , Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and insisted on him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also took part in the sitting but would like to remain anonymous .	-5.4399
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.8644
" Jokowi is a person with good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai committees , " says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-3.1898
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor educational and health services .	-2.7351
Gobai says that Paniai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he has to pay back .	-8.0924
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-1.4993
Despite threats and intimidation , the Paniai victims ’ families carried out a final symbolic act of the trouble : the bodies of a victim were buried on a site precisely with the police and the military station .	-5.3660
You know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes .	-2.9112
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with a thin head .	-7.2916
'What else can we do ? '	-1.4414
Fire captures the Torch cloud scratcher of Dubai for the second time .	-2.5593
A fire found its breakthrough in one of the world 's highest towers in Dubai on Friday , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 metres high , 79-storey buildings .	-4.0743
It is the second brand that will compete in just two years of the high house , which happens to be called the Torch-Tower ( Fackel Tower ) .	-5.7621
The building was evacuated , no injuries were reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.2744
" We slept and we stood up with the fire alarm and the cry of the people .	-3.0526
We ran down the staircase and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " said a resident who called his name as George .	-9.2636
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire control units at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 GMT ) dropped fire and cooled the building .	-4.3531
The government said it was working on providing shelter for those affected .	-3.4255
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world .	-3.8833
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that most of the damage came from the encircled , the outer clothing for decoration or isolation .	-4.1785
In the United Kingdom , the police said , they believe that the system of plates for isolation and lining on the London Greenfell tower in June could contribute to the rapid expansion of a fire , with around 80 deaths .	-5.7438
No Davis Cup reform : Further Best-of-Five	-1.7790
The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has fallen through his big Davis Cup at the General Assembly .	-3.6324
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup sings for only two winnings was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-4.8243
The five-state classics , which are often very long , are very much appreciated by tradition .	-6.8052
63.54 % of the Member States voted for the reform , so the goal of ITF President David Haggerty was only slightly missed .	-3.9211
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the entire package of reforms for the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup .	-3.2353
We need a change to safeguard the long-term future of these iconical and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-6.2759
We will continue to work on improving the applicants .	-2.5120
It was not until the vote after many objections that the proposal was put to the finals in a neutral place .	-4.5808
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : in future , finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the right to host in the next year .	-8.3270
In order to reduce the cost of the organizers , the requirements regarding training courses , etc. will be made easier and players will have to complete less official media deadlines before the Davis Cup .	-5.5592
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers will bring prohibited items to the plane , and a survey will be found out .	-4.4029
A air passenger survey showed that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously prohibited objects were dirty over the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft , while accidentally chemical knives or other objects were blinded .	-6.6131
Less than 1 % claimed that they had been late in discovering that they were mistakenly travelling with weapons , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.7073
The survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers rather disregard the rules .	-3.5389
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried knowingly to fly with something forbidden by the TSA , 19.7 % of Millennials , compared to less than 15 % , were X members .	-4.1714
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.0584
More than 3 % gave the consciousness to whom security-controlled objects were blinded , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs to the plane .	-6.0123
The company said that travellers across the country have surveyed how many accidentally smuggled goods would have brought airport security and how many would have deliberately done .	-5.0429
It is no surprise that those who wear the best smuggling - knowledgeable or ignorant - by safety were those who fly most often .	-5.4917
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are rather complicated and confusing .	-2.2197
People are often unsure about their liquids or how much of them .	-3.2592
So it is no surprise that the largest number of objects confiscated by TSA are prohibited liquids .	-2.8616
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling .	-2.1292
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.5817
Elon Musk does not matter : tens of thousands of Tesla clients cancel orders .	-3.1583
Elektro-Thousand Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-10.9937
In doing so , he has hitherto suggested that some of the customers have withdrawn their reservation without obligation .	-3.7438
In addition to the triumphant turnover figures and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla Chairman Elon Musk revealed another , less glorious figure in the recent quarter review : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-6.2437
Musk has frequently been promoting over 500,000 pre-orders for the new car over the past few months , whose delivery is just beginning .	-4.3929
Musk recognizes that 63,000 of the 518,000 prior orders have been withdrawn .	-4.1433
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that this is just non-binding reservations .	-2.4666
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay EUR 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the UK <unk> 1000 ) " Reservation " totally .	-12.1660
Currently , 455,000 such non-committal reservations are available , Musk conferred analysts in a telephone conference .	-4.3280
However , the Tesla head does not believe that the cancellation of some twelve percent of all orders to date could become the problem .	-4.6418
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not with demand , but on the output side .	-2.5973
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.7543
In 2018 - all models taken together - there will be 500,000 , and one million in 2020 .	-3.3978
The demand for this is obvious .	-1.7679
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-1.5167
Those who order a " Model 3 " today must expect delivery at the earliest possible in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads , which have never been tested in practice , without any major interruptions with maximum utilization .	-5.9186
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.1542
If there were to be larger delays , however , the unbinding nature of the reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-4.3044
This is because the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from going away in sharks .	-4.5900
EPA chief executive Pruitt is pulling back because of the delay in the Obama Era ’ s rules to reduce emissions . .	-9.6843
One day after being sued by 15 countries , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era ’ s rules to reduce emissions of smog-induced air pollutants .	-4.5161
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of public environmental authorities than to previous administrations . to , . to to . to to to to to to to . to	-10.3763
He did not mention the complaint against his previous office in a Federal Tribunal .	-3.5697
It is a period that passed on 1 October for states to comply with the standards of 2015 for soil ozone .	-4.0508
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time , study the plan , and to avoid ' interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth ' .	-3.5584
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma prior to his appointment , was a reliable opponent of stricter environmental legislation .	-3.4010
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels have resisted .	-2.4932
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.2369
Last month , a Federal Tribunal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-3.7905
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his U-turn in ozone standards simply reinforces the EPA 's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of fulfilling the new standards in good time .	-3.8528
" Under previous administrations , the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation " , Pruitt said , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.0879
" We do not believe in the regulation of court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.7542
We also take seriously the law and the authority that exists to us . '	-1.9678
Nevertheless , the EPA ’ s opinion stated that Pruitt will , at some point , use its ' delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are based on sound politics and the best available information ' .	-4.8380
Congressional Republicans urge a broader revision of the ozone rules .	-2.0024
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.5278
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.4126
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.2440
" The reversal of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by smog who flows into their communities , " Schneiderman said .	-4.4539
New York has joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-1.7943
Boden-ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-3.1485
The emerging smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people , and each year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .	-2.1270
Representatives of the public health system and environmentalists applaud pruitts surprising change of course .	-3.9673
" It is worrying how much pressure it needs to take this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe " , said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.2416
" We must continue to fight the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to provide environmental polluters and their special interests . "	-2.9978

750 years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church , the old graveyard area in Tumlingen on Sunday , July 16 will be invited to a serenade .	-3.7660
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful view of the town , the historic St. Hilarius facility is a popular place to stay .	-3.1747
Visitors of the sixth Benefit Serenade can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-3.5085
The rescue and preservation of the oldest building in the village have made friends and supporters tumbles their concern .	-4.7325
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique rural jewel " .	-3.4161
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was mentioned for the first time in the Württembergische Aurkundenbuch : Graf Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church to tumbles along with the Vogtei " to Magister Eberhard of Horb and to his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-10.2189
In addition to the former parish church , according to the text of the document , a rural court , which belonged to the church or the patronate law , was not reversed .	-7.7897
So people living there as well .	-2.4628
As emerged from the description of the Upper Freudenstadt of 1858 , it was not only the Unterdorf and Oberdorf , which are still visible in the town of Tumlingen today , the " Mount " of the third , the ruling village of the village .	-7.9183

Adjoined was the right to deploy a parish or to propose a new parish to the bishop .	-11.1780
Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.4999
The bigger of the two destroyed on Christmas 1673 .	-3.2635
The newly reconstructed bell then took place in 1692 , but later it was in World War II in 1942 .	-5.4507
In the 30-year-old war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the window panes were seized and the bell parts stolen .	-4.6162
The roof was bad .	-3.0175
French troops stood in 1796 near the church .	-2.1566
They broke the candles and chairs and used them as burning wood .	-3.2993
The remains of the church threatened to topple in 1809 .	-2.7393
Until 1869 the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof served as the last rest place for the dead of hearing pillar .	-3.8077
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilarius church broken down .	-2.8157
Only the church tower could be stood .	-2.4420
At the New Year ’ s Night in 1834 , a storm divided the church tower and half crashed .	-3.7903
To prevent an accident , the tower was cut off .	-2.4413
Only the tower that still exists today was preserved as a witness of the 750 years of church history .	-4.1451

Association wants to have wind turbines approved .	-2.1551
Boisheim is not a legal prerequisite for building and has therefore turned to the council .	-4.6286
The " Boisheim " association has invited Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Net . . and .	-14.7572
It has been illegal .	-1.4180
The association argues that , at the time of approval , on 30 December 2016 , no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheim net , because at the time of fourteen , only a wind power concentration zone existed at the city boundary to Schwmtal .	-6.2132
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind power plants is possible , but the concentration zone also excludes wind use for the rest of the city .	-5.3706
These zones should prevent the landscape from being " saved " .	-3.3926
The city of Viersen had decided , a second wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette , a few days earlier , by changing the plans for land use , but had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a form error .	-6.7830
" Due to the lack of a planning requirement , the granted permit is still illegal and therefore redundant " , Christoph Erkens said , chairman of " Boisheim " .	-6.1494
Current state of affairs : the municipal council , before the summer break , again decided on the wind concentration area in the Boisheimer Nette ; an authorisation of the district government is still awaiting .	-6.5133
Examples : " This means that granting authorisation for the construction of wind power plants is not planned " .	-5.5753
The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .	-1.2013
" The corresponding letters were received by the district of Viersen since last week , " said a speaker .	-3.2405
The circle takes it on the grounds of re-examining the matter .	-3.1821
They are not , however , likely to lead to an end to the procedure .	-3.1071
With regard to ongoing procedures at the Administrative Court , the circle on Thursday did not wish to express its opinion on the argument of the " Boisheim " association .	-4.4675
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning on an area on the Boisheimer net the construction of four 200 metres high wind wheels .	-4.2968
Last year , the company in which the city of Viersen is indirectly involved , had already concluded lending contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .	-5.5609
The four wind power plants are designed to meet the electricity needs of around 11 400 households - that is about a fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households .	-4.3369
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.7639
Last summer , Foursen ’ s Town Council gave the green light to purchase three wind power plants at the Wind Park Linnich near Aachen and to participate in a wind power plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district .	-4.7524

Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region should rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.7922
The trade union and city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to entice the inhabitants to the shopping trip to the city centre .	-5.2180
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian King , announced , the " home shop " weekend is intended to raise awareness among customers about the offers offered by their own city beyond the usual supermarket goods .	-6.1520
The plan is therefore a market with regional providers , similar to the weekly market .	-3.1600
In addition , domestic companies are supposed to present themselves with their training places .	-3.4549
In addition , the shops of the city centre should invite you to the midnight shop .	-5.0529
Not only are the activities aimed at inhabitants of the city and the near region .	-3.8299
In preparation are advertising spots in the radio , an Internet video and printed pouches pointing out the action weekend , Christian King .	-4.9135
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .	-2.7244

These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Brunnenfest and sold Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation .	-4.0339
Also attractive offers on Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .	-3.8768
In addition , customer potential should be redesigned or redeveloped .	-3.5661
These include spa guests and tourists .	-2.5706
But many locals , too , would have lost the city sight when shopping .	-4.1996
At the end of the day , everyone would have to contribute to stimulating the city centre - to renting , to the businesses of all the city and clubs .	-5.9982
King said in spring that he would overcome the Lethargy with a network that was spreading .	-5.6801
Birgit Streich , Head of the IHK-Center in Mühlhausen , announced that at the nationwide third " home shop " day , five Thuringian cities participate for the first time .	-4.5774
In addition to Bad Langensalza these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Holy City and Bleicherode .	-3.0065
The day should ' promote ' for the appreciation of local trade and highlight its importance to the common good of our cities ' , it is disputed .	-5.1641
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment with his purchasing behaviour .	-4.5709

Trump put pressure on Mexico after leaked transcripts of telephone calls because of paying the border wall .	-9.8186
Transcripts of phone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia have been published by Washington Post .	-2.2671
On January 27 , Trump , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , called for him to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a projected border wall .	-3.2205
The US President accused him of publicly denouncing the wall , saying , according to reports , ' You cannot tell the press ' .	-4.6083
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise of building a wall on the US ’ s southern border , and swore to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.1800
Transcripts of his first call to Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also released and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.5024
Mr. Trump said to Mr Turnbull that a trade for the US would take over refugees who migrated to Australia ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence of trade forwarded by the Obama administration would make him look like a ' depp ' after proposing a ban on the resettlement of refugees to the US .	-6.0759
Mr Trump ended the call after Mr Turnbull said , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-3.2808
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : activists revive racist lynchat as a call for justice .	-3.4594
A 1948 Ford Mercury was born by a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and pumped to the Moore Ford bridge .	-4.4322
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , reached the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-3.2194
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked through the windscreen .	-4.1520
Press inmates swept into fear .	-4.4377
" We want this n -- r Roger ! " plunged the man .	-2.8232
'Get it out of the car ! '	-1.8136
Shrine crushed the silence when a young black man was torn away from the passenger seat .	-7.8854
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a display .	-2.3314
But when a bog is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , nearly all of them were very real sights in the audience .	-5.5270
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.9772
No one was ever charged for murder .	-1.4161
" It is really incomprehensible that in all these years no single person was arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , which helps organize postal services .	-5.0282
" It is a dirt on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.7051
Brooks is a 71-year-old Congressional representative of the state of Georgia and a life of civil rights activists .	-4.2369
He serves as a dramatic call for action and constitutes an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.2558
" We want prosecution , we want an end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-2.6085
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.1627
A court medical researcher puts a cloth about the body of one of the victims of Moore Ford Lynchen on July 27 , 1946 .	-4.9868
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-3.1409
But none has ever been charged .	-1.9084
Although suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for lynch activities throughout the city was always known : politics and sex .	-3.8905
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the first time in Georgia to cast their votes on the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-4.3679
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI , Roger Malcom , a white landowner , Barnett Hester , stood for a battle - supposedly because of a woman .	-4.1275
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcoms Mrs Dorothy and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .	-3.1563
On 25 July 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to release Malcom from prison , the FBI .	-2.7649
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-1.8163
But when they removed from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.3475
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " it concludes an FBI report .	-3.2426
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the killings , eradicated evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses " .	-9.2127
Brooks formulates it even more pregnant .	-1.4962
" It was an electoral law massacre , " he said .	-1.6551
" You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you are registered and if you vote , then you will be here . "	-4.4071
Cassandra Greene has conducted annual recovery of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder for almost a decade .	-3.3615
Her presentation is illustrative , emotional , and is based on a kind of deep racism , many of which believe that it does not exist in America anymore .	-5.7285
It is hard to watch , and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.2886
" We don 't want to talk about the lynch , because then we are confronted with its complacency in all of us , " she said .	-4.1201
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.0144
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - were pushing into a room and loud when Greene launched an overview of the piece .	-4.9487
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-director .	-1.3600
He has been playing the role of Chief Clan member for years , but he said the role never easier .	-3.6708
" I feel myself dirty because I am not so " , said Marbaugh .	-1.7135
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-2.7452
On the other hand , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , played their lines .	-3.1048
The piece starts with Malcom , who is crying and afflicting Hester , who swept with his wife Dorothy .	-5.7658
" I said n -- he , disappearing from my property ! "	-3.0362
Rascona reveals the fire .	-1.6384
There is a break .	-0.5017
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out into moneys .	-3.8953
Greene laught the loudest .	-1.1927
" What ? ! " , Rascona asked .	-1.2947
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.9048
Was I too harsh ?	-0.5617
" No , " Greene , still said .	-2.3729
" I simply do not believe that white people said then ' n -- he ' .	-2.6779
" But " , " one of the other black actors switched .	-2.2140
" You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-2.5719
And that is precisely where energy shifts in the room , a feeling of cameras replaces the unease .	-4.3439
Everyone is busy getting it right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.4959
The scene starts again .	-1.5607
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.4839
Absolute nobody laughs .	-1.8516
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.4092
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.5085
A woman clothing with mourning clothes is about the corpses of the actor and runs Billie Holidays ' dreaming Lobrede " Strange Fruit " .	-6.0923
Her voice breaks for every second word .	-2.5896
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears blend in eyes .	-4.6069
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white .	-1.3970
A couple is travelled from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the street .	-3.0926
They have experienced moisture almost eight hours of Georgia when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage trip .	-4.6197
Until that point , the murders remained an anecdote , but now , when one stands on the same country where the lynch murders took place , the air feels spectacular .	-5.0075
When finishing the last notes of the song , Greene invites you to come closer and inspect the body name .	-2.9661
Children hook on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and thrill each other .	-4.3480
" You are not really dead , " a small boy murders as if he would remember it .	-3.3400
After a few minutes thanks Greene the amount - and suddenly it is over .	-1.8295
The actors discard the lynch-proportion and cancel their tears .	-4.1773
Bradshaw embarked Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-2.7745
Nick Rascona embraces two of his co-players and then brings together in their poor , the emotional burden of performance eventually breaks with him .	-4.2629
" It is okay " , flourishes one of the women .	-2.6351
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.3756
You did so for a reason . '	-1.2345
Later , the audience met the actors for dinner .	-2.5271
At a table , a white pair from Atlanta suggests about the posting with a black couple that you have just met .	-5.0525
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that have left the feeling .	-2.9392
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , " she said .	-3.1520
" What really does with me makes me believe that the lynch continues , " she added , " today it is called only police foundry . "	-9.7446
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps on his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights .	-2.9227
He said he had already begun to plan the performance of next year .	-3.0142
" The posture is in a way inspiring , for it describes the horrors of what we have suffered , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.5794
" It is like learning nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-2.8817
Those who do not study their own history are condemned to repeat it . '	-2.1182
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth reconciled " Divine Dawn " in Bayreuth .	-3.9229
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf relies on a colourful fresh staging over gigantic , six-storey scenes .	-4.9370
The railway station ( shaped by Aleksandar Denic ) optionally shows a shabby street corner with wall rest and dynamic building in Berlin , a " plast and elast " logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-5.6750
Before that there is an open Mercedes-Oldtimer where the Rhine daughters position themselves as a rock irl , or alternatively an isetta .	-4.1599
Oil barrels are reminiscent of Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power , and greed - which is drawn by his " ring " staging .	-5.9180

Great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which was first shown on stage - in the face of the large heat again in legerary leisure clothing .	-5.4851
Exciting was the appearance of Frank Casstorf and his team of directors .	-2.8982
In 2013 , he had to go through a successful pillar concert , five years later , there were big jubels in which the " Buh " cry was subjected .	-8.0722
Festival chef Katharina Wagner may have been pleased about this .	-3.1982
" You notice that the audience grew together with the " ring " in a way , " she said just before the performance of dpa .	-4.2939
Not only have the audience made some form of peace with Casstorf , but it has also grown to understand the way it sees .	-4.7557

On Wednesday , the EPA announced the decision to move forward the so-called ' 2015 ozone provisions ' , and said that it demonstrated the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-4.7470
" We believe in the dialogue with and by responding to our state partners , " said EPA Chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.0630
Pruitt had announced in June the EPA 's intention to comply with the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions are to be measured in part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to comply with more stringent air quality standards - by one year to be delayed by October 2018 .	-5.4983
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-2.0883
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda , according to Trump , that is supposed to boost economic growth .	-3.0909
The effort , however , has sparked the backlash of democrats and nature conservation groups worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health .	-4.1098
The website of the EPA says that breathing air that contains ozone can reduce the lung function and enhance breathing symptoms , like asthma .	-4.6521
Community space	-2.2183
In the end , the decision was clear : in two countervotes , the municipal council of Fluorn-Wirzeln decides to set up a Community space in the future of senior residences .	-6.0665
Before the discussion , there is important information : the purchase contract for the still missing plot was signed , reports mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.0224
Although the area of land owned so far by the church parish is still going to take , there is now no further obstacle to planning the project to be held by a private investor .	-7.6550
This is a discussion on a Community area .	-3.3187
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to come up against the community .	-3.5331
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with 70 square metres area for a special price .	-4.0516
The administration and the majority of the municipal councillors suggest that such a Community area should not only be a meeting place for residents of senior-rich housing , but should be open to the community .	-7.8479
As an example , the word " Strickcafé " made the round .	-1.7682
The decision to be made by the provision of funds for the current budget as early as last autumn is sweetened by means eligibility .	-4.9021
The building is located in the renovation area .	-2.4340
The establishment of a Community area , Tjaden has reported , would be capable of promoting 60 % of 30 % . , as . , , , , , , , . , , , ,	-8.5511
The resolution envisages , in order to signal to the investor , that in this respect , he does not want to throw a gap between the legs , the finding that both saddle - as opposed to environmental construction - and powder roof - would be possible , thereby reducing the weapon level and making the construction of economic .	-9.2182
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer think this addition .	-2.1369
If 's helping : unanimously he passes the body .	-4.3622
The Community area is not as simple as that .	-1.7369
Daniela reputation refers to the many buildings with which we are not moving so fairly , for which we now have a common space from the window , saying : ' I am difficult to do so ' .	-7.6580
Yvonne Stager is absolutely in favour of the Community area , but totally opposed to municipal participation .	-3.9202
It views hidden subsidies to assets or even foreign investors .	-2.9306
This is not the case , because with acquiring the area you do not grant a grant but get a genuine equivalent value which , in case of doubt , can be marketed , is the background .	-6.9883
There are three supporters who advocate the proposal for a resolution .	-4.3840
Two contradictions remain with the original programme , which Stefan Haller summarizes : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-4.9003

The association is planning Star Wars Saint Andreasberg .	-5.8714
Göttingen has been a planet route since 2003 .	-3.2289
A " star-path " comes up against the information needs of many researchers , said it .	-4.4111
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.2869
The members want to work along the planned route panels and inform them of stars and stars .	-4.9846
At a first stage until 2018 , the association plans " well accessible installations at five to six places " in Oberharz .	-4.2888
Questions come from St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeiss and Sieber .	-3.2020
The information on the table should be added to the Internet .	-3.1021
That ’ s why good mobile network access plays a role in the selection of locations .	-4.3496
Freedom of barrier is also a criterion .	-1.5018
The train will be expanded later by train .	-2.8394
The observer has a lot of knowledge about the physics of each star on the Star Trek : The Association has explained .	-6.5546
Moreover , they learned why stars would have different colors or why a star shines more than another , even though it was far away .	-4.8328
They will also communicate in what constellation a selected star is and when it is best to see .	-5.7480
Since 2014 , the association has been operating in the Bergstädttschen St. Andreasberg ( Bergstädtze St. Andreasberg ) the highest star waiting in North Germany .	-6.7236
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.7181
Often you can see from there the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with the mere eye .	-7.5221

The stones with the individual planets , including the pluto degraded to dwarf , are set accurately at the distance and measurement of one to two billion .	-5.8374
Earth thus shrinks to a bullet of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , whereas the exact 75 meter sun is measuring 70 centimetres .	-4.9972
The entire distance of the planet route is four kilometres .	-1.9995
While the light from the sun to the pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to the steel with pluto .	-3.5221
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in the world .	-1.5450

" I am a former weight , " reminded Garcia .	-6.4194
" I 'm up for Broner [ 140 pound ] , but I 'm not that big .	-3.3610
I am small for 140 .	-0.7341
I would like to get down to ease .	-2.5369
And he has to move to light weights [ 135 pounds ] , and then we will fight .	-8.7007
That is what fans are demanding .	-1.9132
Let us do that for them . '	-1.4011
Lomachenko agreed .	-2.2307
'Boxes need this battle ' .	-2.0384
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year in order to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) to fight against the winners of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title campaign on September 23 .	-5.2709
" This battle could take place in Pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it , " said Garcia and later expressed openly fighting at the network that offers the best financial package .	-4.3242

Four Injured to Reifenplatter	-2.2845
Four people were partly seriously injured in a A7 accident on Thursday afternoon .	-2.5288
After the first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the connection point , presumably after a tire placer .	-6.0620
The car went to the right of the bad , where he was overflowing and then left on the roof in the green .	-6.0257
The four inmates - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .	-2.5546
During the initial supply of injuries by the rescue service , the A7 was locked for about one hour to the north , then traffic was passed on the left route at the accident site .	-5.4277
Fortunas Hoffmann : " Three chains work better "	-1.8432
Andre Hoffmann hopes after the 2 : 2 season battle against Braunschweig that the optimization of the defense format will bring to eye points .	-5.3360
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , with the result too , would not have been the two counters at the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-3.8662
" These were two opponents too much , and we need to be more careful in Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defender .	-4.3515
In the Erzgebirge , the triple chain will also be further optimised .	-4.4140
And a gate for freezing do not want to capture any more .	-3.9064
" For the future , it will be that no longer puts itself on the line next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-3.9847
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will cope better with the three-chain even after the experiences of preparing it , than with the fourth chain .	-5.7607
" I still do not know how we will act in Aue " , says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , " because we have in the three-chain at the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well , " Hoffmann said .	-5.3128
" The precondition is , but that we harmonise even better and we do not afford so many errors in the construction . "	-5.4618
Of course , Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-3.0148
" Whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know .	-2.9971
Hoffmann believed that the performance could be quite okay , " .	-5.8493
" If , however , we are on Sunday with four points and we can concentrate on the Pokal , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper meeting of seasons . "	-6.5633
His coach did not want to know about this .	-2.4358
" I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over eye , simply because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a weather .	-4.6973
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " Funkel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might be even more fresh , because they would not have a hard and complete game like Fortuna against a premiere of ascent in the bones .	-6.2376
" But they don 't know as much as 100 % of what they currently stand , " says Fortuna 's inner defender .	-3.6446
The visitors from the Rhineland as a light favorite on Sunday go to the meeting in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-4.8207
" That we swept them away , just because we are entitled to come under the first six , is a noble sense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet at only one defeat against an eye from nine games is very positive .	-6.6232
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that you have to beat from the start , " says Fortunas Chefcoach .	-3.9169
" Such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming . "	-2.6538
And so Funkel certainly doesn 't want to experience his players on Sunday .	-3.5480
New Results of Swedish Asylum Revaluation Tests	-3.3242
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of those tested are older than 18 , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.2198
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine ( Law Medicine Code ) has begun carrying out the tests last year .	-7.0324
They should , during the asylum procedure , make age assessment more accurate after the Swedish Migration Authority ( Trading of Migration ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were under.	-5.3362
Until today , migration sales have sent 6.880 cases to be tested , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-3.7725
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged 18 or older , while in 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.7845
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person ' may be under 18 years old ' .	-2.1540
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-2.4910
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been constant in recent months .	-2.1430
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the Local magazine .	-2.9464
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied above his age .	-2.6561
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that " suggest that the studied person is 18 years or older " .	-2.9126
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet studied the 581 results published , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person frankly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-7.9497
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-ray recordings of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings are made by knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , was also criticised in some areas .	-4.7573
A skeptic is the endocrinology Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work involves assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went through puberty sooner or later .	-4.1006
" I had reason to think about this and I do not believe that the kind of measurement should be used .	-2.7032
Judging the biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.3857
If we cannot say it surely , we should not pretend that we could , " he said the Metro newspaper .	-3.6791
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as adults is low .	-3.2335
The biggest risk is that if the person is just under 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-3.5104

The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is proceeding well .	-3.0181
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy emphasis was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.3320
" We are very good at the time it runs super " , says Reinhold Light , Construction Manager at the department of road and traffic in the Presidential Presidency Freiburg .	-5.0198

The bridge at the entrance of the village of Lauterbach now received a 1,30 meters wide on the north side on Wednesday morning and received seven tonnes of heavy bridge cap .	-4.8537
This is a marginal attachment which is also used as operating routes .	-3.0358
The southern part of the bridge is to be used on Friday by a 2.20 metres wide bridge cap .	-3.7040
That is what pedestrian path should be like .	-3.1780
The most important thing is that they are prefabricated parts , a patent of Schramberg company Dizolo .	-3.8757
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-1.7373
A special fingertip feeling has required the laying of lines through the construction in Lauterbach .	-4.9014
There is also a glass fibre cable connected to many companies .	-3.0400
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by hand cutters .	-4.0134
In addition , fish and cancer had to be fished first .	-2.1135
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the railway station in the direction of Schramberg , traffic is governed by an traffic traffic traffic traff.	-5.5215
The road in the area of the bridge to the altitude of the Hotel Tannenhof and Seven Linden is fully closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance .	-5.9013
The cost of the three bridges is EUR 700 000 .	-3.1388
Funding is done by the country as a whole .	-2.6248

Looking at the event at the Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.3913

Despite his comments , the IAF Congress voted for maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-2.8429
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAF President Coe to the reporters .	-1.8367

Coe said that he was also ' delighted ' about Russia accepting the criteria for his re-introduction .	-6.1757
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to resume Russia , " Coe said .	-3.5579
" In the coming months , we must do everything we can to normalize this situation .	-2.2967
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the dormant system " , he added , " he added , in addition , that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the dormant system " .	-4.4422

This was attended by the Königshaus on Thursday .	-4.2718
Traditionally , the Danish Königspaar is preserved in the Church of Roskilde .	-4.3577
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already completed a sarcophagu for the two .	-2.0471
The queen was in agreement with the decision of her husband , and so was the communication .	-3.9028
Where Prince Henrik will be buried is unclear .	-2.2891
He does not , however , intend to be involved in his French home .	-3.1089
Prince Henrik had never made a secret of his title unhappy .	-2.9394
After the throne ascent of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would like to become king .	-5.2741
In 2016 , he went to retirement and also issued the title " Prince Merchant " .	-5.1238
Since Henrik did not get the title and function he wanted , he doesn 't see himself as equivalent to his wife - even after death , Lene Balley declared that he was the chief speaker of the Danish Königshauses .	-5.6966

Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election	-1.5251
CDU and FDP before possible majority voting in Lower Saxony	-1.4039
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of land , but he does not want to resign .	-3.6255
Because Friday argued for the disintegration of Parliament .	-3.1281
Previously , the surprising exit of a Green MEP from their country in Lower Saxony had brought down the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .	-3.6719
Five months before the official date of the country elections , the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its narrow one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-4.0971
The Green MEP Elke Twesten up to now justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.2252
" I see my political future in the CDU " , she said in Hanover on Friday .	-2.1531
CDU Chief of the Group of the European People 's Party ( Christian Democrats ) and European Democrats , Björn Thümler , is recommendto his group .	-4.7640
The CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in the Netherlands , SPD and Green 68 seats .	-3.0890
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-1.9233
The new land day will be elected regularly on January 14 .	-2.8310
Thümler said that the red-green government must now decide whether or not they can continue to rule in this situation without a majority .	-3.7954
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day should decide its self-resolution as quickly as possible .	-3.8987
The CDU Group will probably decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-1.9598
The Constitution also provides for the possibility that the country will withdraw confidence and elect a successor to the Prime Minister .	-4.0363
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-0.9704
These opportunities must be subject to clean legal scrutiny , " Thümler said .	-2.9858
" People will calmly discuss all the issues when they are legally reasonably examined . "	-5.0494
Thümler called Tweste step " somewhat kurios " .	-3.4861
The politician himself stressed : ' I am not a traitor .	-1.4752

The Green group chairman Anja Piel said : ' We very much regret the decision taken by Elke Twesten ' .	-3.2166
You have made a conscious decision not to have a debate in the group .	-2.8627
'Even against the background that there were no substantive differences , we cannot understand that step ' .	-3.8066
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of the Lower Saxon Green Members , Elke Twesten , to the CDU as a betrayal .	-3.2183
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate , but also betrayal of the Red Green , " the Federal Chief of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-3.1241
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to re-elect the country ’ s day .	-4.0451
The Tweisten exit costs the majority of red green in Lower Saxony .	-3.9396
Politicians ' place ' in their injured vanity and in their frustration their personal interests before the wellbeing of the country ' , criticised the SPD Secretary-General , Hubertus He.	-5.6212
" It is scandal that the CDU participates in Lower Saxony in this dirty intrusive game and tries to make political capital out of it " .	-4.4843
Lower Saxony 's Chief of the CDU Group , Björn Thümler , is recommending that his members include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-4.3797
The SPD ’ s Chief of the Group in Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of falsifying the outcome of the country ’ s election in 2013 .	-4.5516

Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic fertilizers , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.9413
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8118
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.0638
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.4942
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in interview with the editorial network Deutschland ( RND ) speech and reply . , , and . , , , ,	-6.1113
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.6444
I can only encourage consumers to look closely at the eggs in their fridge and to check the stamp pressure .	-3.4351
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food Warnung.de , the Federal States are providing the most up-to-date information on the egg charges concerned .	-5.3328
Any eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.7168
Even if , as we know at the moment , there is virtually no risk to health .	-3.3754
Now Aldi is taking on the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of supply - because the central role of the Enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister of Agriculture ?	-4.1078
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .	-2.0365
Nonetheless , my House has switched on and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known .	-5.6010
All information and risk assessment are available to the consumer .	-2.2910
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe to health .	-4.6880
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded , it is not safe to transport .	-4.9055
Unburdened eggs , however , can be sold and consumed .	-2.4683
This time it is not the business that is to blame .	-1.9587
Do manufacturing companies and consumers sit on the same boat ?	-2.1472
As we know , production operations are not directly to blame .	-3.6230
Instead , they must face economic damage because of presumably illegal practices by service companies .	-3.4116
As always , in the seriousness , there are too few controllers .	-3.3360
Is it lacking in staff or exclusive competence ?	-3.5579
It was in fact the official controls that revealed the process .	-2.9615
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out to 100 % .	-7.6721
It is precisely for this reason that consistent clarification of these events and the transfer to public prosecutors in cases where criminal offences are available are crucial .	-5.6837
I have made it clear on several occasions that I expect full clarification from the authorities .	-3.2848
Is regular alarmism really necessary in the case of food scandals ?	-1.6016
Consumers are entitled to have food that is safe and that is .	-6.8490
If a non-authorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indignant .	-3.0662
The funds tailored have brought manufacturers , traders and consumers into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-4.1934
It must be made quite clear in principle that the illegal use of the insecticid Fitronil in the attitude of food-delivering animals is unacceptable and must be put to an stop .	-5.6276
We must work consistently and forcefully on this at all levels .	-2.8401
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify this situation swiftly and completely .	-4.8261
The effects of football ’ s financial rules on Neymar ’ s move to Paris affect the move to Paris .	-3.3095
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenses of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-8.4740
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champion League tournament .	-3.9827
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must prove at some point that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-3.6655
Barcelona has paid EUR 22 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian from its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will receive several $ 10 million per year .	-3.9393
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.1755
PSG can certainly make money easier for Neymar to sign and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , in view of the financing of the team by the rich Katar ruler family .	-5.0356
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must be countered with legitimate sources of revenue enabling them to make the Break Evens point in their business on football .	-5.0637
FP was conceived by Michel Platini for his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.2903
Former French players believed that if banks or owners withdrew their support , clubs that had borrowed enormous debt in their quest for success would cheat effectively and risk ruin .	-5.1622
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.3442
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich initially used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested vigorously to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue .	-9.3807
During the current three-year FFP disposal period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.0302
And , while Platini fell in Ungnade by the presidency in 2015 , UEFA ’ s successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to arrest excessive spending .	-3.9053
" Certainly , FFP is not dead , and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP , opposed to The Associated Press last week .	-3.9515
Although the PSG paid the Neymar Buy-out clause in a package , the PSG may distribute the amount for reporting on the duration of its contract .	-4.2766
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the five-year replacement amount for the next five years can be expelled to the tune of EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-4.3012
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 hit the PSG with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , with the most serious sanctions .	-2.8862
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( $ 82 million at that time ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champion League were limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-3.8859
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by leaving their revenue from companies associated with a club ’ s owners .	-4.3429
While a Catarian company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring had to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not make this considered legitimate income .	-3.7540
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.0601
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the WM 2022 Organization Committee .	-3.2258
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denounced that Neymar will become WM ambassadors , and that such a maneuver for the UEFA regulators could easily be found out .	-3.6217
Previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observe any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.5601
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar Transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-3.4337
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.7259
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-4.0129
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .	-2.0040
PSG expects Neymar 's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and tricot sales .	-2.3006
The association assumes that sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-2.6547
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to watch one of the best football players , and it tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-4.0175
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of La League , Javier Teba , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Katars eventually owned PSG .	-4.0229
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La Lega against a state that finances an association .	-3.5761
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years " , said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.9471
" Once a country has a club , it 's possible .	-3.1487
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because it is possible to have different paths or different interests if a country has such a large actor to represent a country ' .	-4.3031
Swiss is looking for a new schoggi supplier .	-1.8088
In recent years , Chocolat Frey Bord chocolate has been manufactured for the swiss . , . , , , , , , , ,	-5.6574
Now , sweet cooperation is about a possible end : the airline rewrites the order .	-3.4348
Swiss-Spokerin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed a report on Friday at the request of the news agency sda .	-3.6113
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-1.7785
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control .	-2.0314
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-1.7386
Around 17 million small red white bowls are distributed to 14 grams per year by air pets before landing to passengers .	-4.4842
No information was available about the costs .	-4.3609
Insiders estimate the order volume according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around a billion francs .	-3.8964
But more important is the advertising effect : for a schoggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order .	-3.0724
How many applicants are there on the new tender , the Swiss will not betray .	-3.8700
However , only Swiss manufacturers in question come in .	-2.5828
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey intends to seek an renewal of the Treaty beyond the spring of 2018 .	-3.2679
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.1079
The Swiss spread the chocolate panels on board their flights since 2006 .	-6.1091
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut , in collaboration with Hug , provided the chocolate tablets .	-7.0227

Nostalgia goes into " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " into the Nische Nicholas .	-7.0946
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time because of the glorious days of the characters of the 1980s , for the 90-year-old Grunge era ( when the David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for himself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd turned to larger things .	-5.3853
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and a embodiment of our facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-2.8264
But as a franchise it feels as though time is short .	-2.1579
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speech dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-2.7460
By defeating at the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they still made it impossible to win back the last part of the joke .	-4.9957
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the footage principle , including a reef to the Stalker movies of the 1990s , like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand that shovels the cradle " ) .	-6.6818
At one point , a character stumbles through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates , and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.2722
Many of the central stories are the same .	-0.9837
The lovely Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now Romanauthor , has still not forgotten cation ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.8479
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virgin .	-5.3737
And there is another malicious plot that Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showalter ) is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.0021
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.2340
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillons sublip of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-3.7852
They are the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I approve as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band as it will visit the film-premiere of " Wet hot American Summer " .	-6.1084
Comrade Detective is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East opposite West ring-iconography .	-4.1381
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as the director indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two Bucharest officers who are fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism .	-4.4643
The main rolls - a hard-spotted Gregory and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronised by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levitt in English .	-4.2259
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.6071
But it is not much more than one idea .	-1.2322
There are some beautiful gags to watch ( the police spend the time watching chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .	-4.6150
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find out the voice ' .	-3.3744
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single .	-3.2307
There are six long episodes to go there , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-3.6455
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited to a smaller length , could provide its agitprop saint better , because Gregor and Iosef are constantly visiting the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who hide a cluster of Hamburg .	-7.4718
The message to the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for it .	-3.9761
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong : we even do it with our own younger history and with their own own own . , . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.9014

15 people were arrested at age between 25 and 77 and were already arrested against them .	-9.1224
In addition , the officials secured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine , guns and several hundred thousand euros .	-3.4548
At the same time , two people were arrested in Italy .	-2.4404
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italians .	-2.6413
The two are presumably delivered to Germany .	-2.5554
Italian and Bavarian investigators participated in the action .	-6.9884
Overall , over 300 police officers were in use .	-2.1852

Since summer 2016 the Public Prosecutor 's Office has identified Constance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.1594
Between the Public Prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a regular exchange and investigators of Kripo Rottwer had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.4130
That is why the great effort on Wednesday morning was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-2.6835
Investigations were mainly aimed at Italian citizens with close reference to the Italian mafia .	-4.2444
An incident on May 27 in Hübingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bank account .	-5.3748
This deplores big gaps in the Foreign Register	-1.6629
'Citizens ' data , which should not come up there ' : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany has considerable shortcomings .	-4.8716
This leads to partly serious misjudgements in asylum procedures .	-3.1851
The Federal Government 's Refugee Management Representative , Frank-Jürgen Welt , has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central register in a media report .	-4.7727
Shortcomings in the data registered there may result in asylum procedures and deportations , " in some cases serious errors , " warned in an analysis presented by the " South German newspaper " .	-5.6419
The register states that ten million people are receiving foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million non-EU countries .	-3.6988
The data is therefore managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.5948
Because the data has not been kept sufficiently , the quality of the data in parts has not been good .	-3.8535
In individual cases , data have been found in 1921 , " of people who have long since stopped living , or of citizens who have become German citizens and should not be appearing in the register " .	-5.1207
" Bug data input may slow returns " , said the report afterwards .	-5.1123
Moreover , the statistics on people who are eligible for travel are EU citizens who do not need to travel .	-4.6652
Such misguided allocations , however , led to a distorted debate on the handling of exit obligations , " said in the analysis .	-4.1227
In the meantime , the Federal Government has apparently begun to send refugee families with children under 16 to Italy once they have entered them .	-3.8716
It emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.6416
The paper therefore states that BAMF has been repatriating to Italy since 1 June 2017 on families with children , with the exception of infants and infants .	-4.6503
Since the end of 2014 , this has virtually no longer been possible , with reference to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.5337
Following the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for the first time they reach .	-3.5840
If a migration continues to travel to another EU country , that state can send it back to the country of origin .	-4.0759
To justify this , the office now writes : ' Meanwhile , the absorption capacity for families with inferior children in Italy has increased substantially ' .	-3.9452
Italy has guaranteed the acceptance and accommodation of families .	-2.1131
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) believes that these commitments are sufficient .	-2.7177
Other EU countries , too , would send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.8189
The left-wing political spokesman in the Bundestag , Ulla Yelpke , criticised this decision : " Families with children are threatened by the deficiencies in Italian asylum systems in conditions of human rights absorption and a threat to child welfare " .	-5.4078

In total , 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreienbach provided blood donation services already for other people .	-3.3221
At least the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-1.8807
All the leading Jürgen Greule who , with its 100 donations , now shared 50 litres of blood .	-4.5898
Traditionally , the municipality recognises the multiple willingness to donate blood at the meeting of the municipality .	-3.7849
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay attention to the donors who make their blood available for strangers , even unusual , " underlined mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-5.9561
" One single blood donation helps several people " , explained by the chairman of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the conservatives are dismantled into their components .	-4.8154
Three people could , for example , benefit from a blood donation .	-3.0009
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported the actions that were carried out in Oberreienbach in spring .	-3.5497
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the willingness circuit manager .	-3.1374
Clearly , a few years ago , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants .	-3.9534
Even before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umber were awarded among the multiple donors and were awarded for each 50 blood donations .	-4.2953

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 % .	-1.0567
The Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakened speculation of a rise .	-3.4184
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will " remain " when it maintained interest rates on family income in the midst of increased pressure .	-3.4562
The Bank ’ s policymakers voted in favour of 0.25 % interest rates this month , as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .	-4.3569
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 , to 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that fiscal income would continue to pressure , with inflation expected to rise to just 3 % in the autumn .	-3.3162
But they signaled that interest rates would be needed in the next few years to curb Brexit inflation , and they said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in the financial markets .	-3.9324
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the mammoth stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.8108
It will be demanding time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funds for banks from February next , despite the fact that it has now been said that it will be expected to spend $ 15 billion more on the basis of this system - with <unk> 115 billion Sterling . .	-6.6042
Following the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the central forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on real incomes still burdens consumption . '	-4.4264
At interest rates , it reiterated that " a certain tightening of monetary policy " would be necessary to cool inflation and a " slightly larger " scale than markets expect .	-3.9925
Markets are currently forecasting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.5748
The Bank stressed , however , that increases would be ' progressive ' and ' limited ' .	-2.0448
The Bank ’ s downward fixed growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % projected in May .	-2.7934
It has maintained its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.5904
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news .	-2.5122
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .	-1.9434
The decision will not change , after the recent disappointing growth figures have damaged rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and increased GDP in the second quarter from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % .	-4.1255
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will slightly recover slightly after the Bank by the end of the year .	-2.7870
The recent inflation report gave little enthusiasm for households that will be affected by rising inflation and slight salary increases , as tightening up becomes even worse before it gets better .	-5.1240
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income slump " in the next few years , but she added that wages will recover " clearly " at the end of their three-year prediction .	-4.3126
The economy will also be strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.1413
The decision will take place one year after the drop in interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to decline .	-4.4423
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve prices and the economy in full .	-2.5382
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates , as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers claiming an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.5089
Inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , even though the bank said that it was expected to do so and that it will recover in the coming months .	-4.8789
The Bank said that the excess in relation to its target of 2 % is " totally " to the weak pound .	-3.8159
Andrew Montlake , the Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " In view of the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , because lenders are seeking shops and want to finish the year positively .	-4.9521
The market looks particularly good for those where the existing deals run out and complete the new mortgages , and many with fee free options and low rates are becoming more popular . " . and , , , , , , , and and , " , . , , , , , , , , ,	-12.8389
NHS ( National Health Service ) is supposed to write controversial HIV 10,000 people into disputed HIV drugs 10,000 .	-5.0106
Patients will receive access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle against the NHS High Court .	-4.0761
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxe ( PrEP ) , which may reduce the risk of infection for high-risk patients by about 86 % , is now delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-5.4294
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s appeal court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for PrEP , despite the assertion that local authorities should finance it .	-9.1298
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England-Chairman Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " .	-3.6307
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and more clinics will follow in October before it is introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.2278
Pre-exposure prophylaxes ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.7231
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the HIV transmission of infectious persons .	-2.8930
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are enough medications in one person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-4.3769
Such medicines can be taken daily or so two hours before sexual intercourse .	-3.6199
Those who are in question for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.7018
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by anti-retroviral treatment .	-3.2751
People living in England and registered with a house doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-3.3870
The programme will be <unk> 10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week after international competitive procurement .	-3.0691
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , which is used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.5892
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.4065
It is another milestone in the progress that has been going on over three decades in tackling one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . '	-3.7438
Deborah Gold , NAT Chief Executive , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-12.0776
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the possibility to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.9020
From September to September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to the improvement of many lives .	-3.9964
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.0442
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority now has to be for the study to be carried out quickly across the country and not for anyone who has a risk to HIV to be left .	-4.1502
Now that PrEP testing medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way of protecting more than 10,000 HIV infected people . ' .	-3.8972
Sharon Hodgson , the shadow minister of health , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and timid implementation by the government .	-3.9033
The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can stop the transfer of these life-changing infection .	-2.8167
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.4293
It is now important for this study to be carried out as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV , and to help bring about a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-5.2171
The big life : between floor and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-5.4923
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , diminished in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.4240
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her pockets .	-3.5412
" Before I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space , " says Joanne .	-5.9866
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-1.6062
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court , and she had the same high ceilings .	-6.0181
I was in love with her and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.5893
Since the first tour the 1,000 square foot big apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.8837
Originally a one-room farm with a nested layout - it had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage room and an intermediate floor to use the generous ceiling .	-6.4705
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.2780
That was my ' requirement ' , she says .	-1.7981
For this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.0071
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where one could stand .	-4.5364
It had to think creatively to solve the target .	-3.3018
" The steel mill is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.1176
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were tailored to one another without having to miss us .	-4.5746
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below . '	-4.8650
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much additional drama .	-3.2906
For the middle floor a classic Retrouvius copper lighting window overlooks the glamorous living area .	-4.0509
Gold furniture mirrored , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the .	-2.9423
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .	-1.3768
On both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-2.6642
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.0767
At the entrance , mirrored units provide space for all bags and glasses of Joanne .	-3.9457
By perceiving a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.0471
Companible kitchen is nothing new .	-3.1792
The particular thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.0986
" A bit of engineering went into that " , Erfan explains of the steel amplified MDF door .	-10.4239
" It is opposing , so when you push the door , it slides very easily . "	-4.2739
Thanks to the smart use of space and closet space Joanne has won an additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.4413
" At the end of the day you will sell the land area - or how your property is estimated , " says Erfan .	-2.7378
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate broker will enter and make a calculation based on the size of the ground " .	-2.8999
They have managed to enlarge the floor surface while using high-quality materials that give the space a luxurious advantage .	-5.0677
" The materials are the things that you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home " , says Erfan .	-6.7604
" You don 't fall into the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.9254
These are important , but they don 't play with your heart ' .	-1.6504
It shows that an apartment can be transformed into something quite amazing , thanks to good design and increased square meters range of something standard .	-4.8242
In fact , like Joanne , you may choose not to leave it .	-2.5927
Brothers struggle for a $ 500 million Empire in real estate	-6.0268
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in an argument about one of Victoria ’ s largest housing empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.1925
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to explain how their property and business wealth should be shared .	-4.3017
Paul has wanted to withdraw from family operation since 2014 , but a sharp debate on separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.8733
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers owned 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars since the 1973 family bought a business on Smith Street , Collingwood .	-3.3889
The Westco Jeans family there founded a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.6472
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-0.8689
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as suburban shopping centres .	-3.8735
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of company assets and Paul , about one third .	-4.5417
A court act says that this means that Colin ownership amounts to $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.4129
The division of real estate and cash has turned out to be a problem for Paul .	-2.0087
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit .	-3.1401
Last Friday , following several failed conciliation , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.1099
The brothers are now also fighting for controlling existing business , which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out .	-4.4620
Colin argues that this is not true , but invites Paul to manage some of the meetings incompetently .	-4.0401
In an early affidavit filed by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-7.6202
" My Italian legacy claims that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.6857
The costs are rising in this case , with hundreds of affidaits pages , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitcher , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and the law firms held . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8155
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants who operated milk and delicate business from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-4.2281
They used the security to buy the Collingwood-song , where the Colin opened the first jeans shop of the family .	-5.1551
Colin says he began Westco there when " in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( approximately 10 years old ) . "	-4.2809
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on amicably to their sons .	-2.4914
" Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brethren to go to court , " she wrote .	-2.1707
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke 26 million .	-3.8641
Both Lukas and Mark were concealed , Paul says " about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-3.8500
Colin retained very reticent even though he was a former AFL member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire of the best friend of the TV star .	-4.2989
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.2602
Only Colin replied to SMS to say " I really cannot say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.4243
" It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.7646
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the Court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.7262
" Our father didn 't want Paul to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-2.6347
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-1.1816
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " said Colin .	-2.3270
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.2346
Others tried it and failed .	-0.9750
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-1.7488
If so , it will be the first .	-0.9780
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including the news media reports , in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even-handed course .	-3.7539
This is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.1987
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior staff on his first day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that comes into the president ’ s hands .	-3.4622
Kelly said to employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in letters - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . '	-3.9439
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media .	-1.5475
President Trump ’ s relationship with television is enough for decades – and now , where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.2070
" When Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts to be convinced , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunrg said in February about Politico .	-9.5228
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keep Trump ’ s twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , it is to ensure that his personal media consumption consists of a constant lobby price . "	-9.9154
Okay .	-0.6111
But the idea that Trump ’ s twitter habit ever was “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-2.0345
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we others do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets would contain more fuel without their interventions .	-3.4266
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.4124
If his staff managed to keep him in trouble , then their efforts have been worthwhile .	-4.3191
But nobody has been consistent in preventing Trump from engaging in controversy .	-2.4356
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.2093
Politico - working with this history - reported in May on the preference of consultants to provide dubious information to the President for strategic reasons .	-4.3904
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmaker :	-1.1888
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he fits to find out where they come from .	-3.4425
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone badly accused the president of a printed copy of an article from GottNews.com , the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh to be " the source behind a pile of lecks " in the White House .	-9.0455
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence , or that in the past he expressed false accusations and revoked them .	-5.0027
Trump read the article and began to consult employees about Walsh . '	-2.0229
Goldmaker added that the then Head of Staff Reance Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper tree that Trump receives " .	-4.3407
How did this fall ?	-1.8458
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .	-1.5283
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still striving for influence .	-3.7411
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.7482

Travellers negotiate a tomb and return to the ' Millionary series ' .	-2.5777
Some of the wealthiest wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back on war with some determined travelers who negotiated a ditch of the municipality to claim a field before their homes .	-7.1976
The travellers have parked their 20 cars in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , which is called the " Millionary series " .	-8.9852
They have brought horses , babies and an army of transporters with them only when they were thrown out in May , without being deterred by a ditch excavated by the Council in order to prevent their delicacies .	-7.0322

Forging residents insisted on the Solihull Council saying that it is ' useless to tackle the problem ' .	-4.4215
An anonymous resident said : " You are pulled there on Monday night after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones on passengers .	-4.8435
The Council must be forced into action by shame of implementation because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.4988
The travellers were there in May , were moved on and are now back .	-2.9986
More came up yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.0608
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by keeping long understatements to protect their parks .	-3.2063
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community if the Council cannot even stop that . '	-2.7203
A resident who did not want to be called , said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-4.3462
The figures increased this time , and one even saw horse in the park area . '	-3.4873
A spokesman from the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp on the land beyond the Streetsbrook Road and are working with the Solihull police , we are taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as soon as possible .	-5.7836
To support our collection of proof , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling for 101 .	-3.1722
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . '	-3.1598

Former Hotel Birkenhof will be the Waldhotel Luise .	-3.1017
The house in front of the gates of the city will be renovated and reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.6561
This is good news for the city .	-2.0290
After all , the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente company mbH to 13 April 2014 lost some 30 000 nights per year and revenue through the cure tax .	-6.4455
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the council as a collection of accommodation for controversial discussions .	-4.9819
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers through the creation of a cultivation plan in order to secure the area as a hotel location .	-8.8092
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at that time .	-3.0386
But above all exciting city mayor Julian Oswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interest at the time .	-5.9134
He should be right .	-0.9261
The Luisenhotels Group , managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzaber , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will once again make it a house of the Three Star Plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-5.4202
The group has four houses with the joyful town .	-4.1764
Two of them in Bad Bergzaber and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.7736
You are hot Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-2.1853
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time now , and if you enter the house you will see the extensive renovation work being done .	-5.6436
The floors were removed , some ceilings were removed , old bathtubs were removed from the rooms .	-4.7859
The entire hotel is a single building .	-1.4843
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.0038
" It 's really a beautiful hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.6450
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.9004
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is changed , new windows are added .	-4.3383
Everything should later become " beautiful close to the citizens " , as Thomas Scher.	-4.4651
" We want to make a jewelry out . "	-1.9439
The swimming pool , spa and meeting room are all equipped .	-3.8732
We did not want to position ourselves at the high level of Lauterbad hotels , but already at a high level of inner city , Scherer points out .	-6.0264
The Waldhotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , wishes to create a broad range of facilities , explains Scherer .	-9.7070
Individual travellers , groups and businessmen should feel at home in the hotel .	-4.4112
Talks to OB Julian Oswald and tourist director Michael Krause have already held , Scherer .	-2.8558
The city 's ideas are equivalent to those of the hotel group .	-3.0550
'We are on the same line . '	-0.5491
When it comes to investments , Thomas Scherer does not want to decide exactly .	-4.1036
He accounts for just under one million euros .	-2.8938
The external facilities are also put on the front , which is already clearly visible .	-3.9389
A large terrace will be accessible from the restaurant in a courtyard .	-3.1198

Russia affair : US Special Enterprise sets Grand Jury into a Russian affair .	-3.6008
In the Russian affair around US President Donald Trump , special investigator Robert Mueller is expected to have used a so-called grand jury after a report .	-4.0761
The body has started work over the past few weeks , and the Wall Street Journal has been writing on the subject of familiar people .	-5.3011
The newspaper revealed that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.9329
The CNN Sender reported that there were already initial presentations of the body related to a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.4556
US intelligence services have accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-1.8272
Mueller investigates whether there were any Trump campaign and Moscow deals .	-2.4102
The investigation focuses on several men who acted as Republican adviser in the election campaign .	-7.4983
According to reports , Mueller also scrutinized more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.0557
A few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that Trump ’ s special enquiry personally took centre stage and examined the accusation that the President might have hindered the judiciary during the affair .	-4.8744
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine these evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be made .	-3.7585
As such , Grand Jurys are also called prosecutors .	-4.6363
Usually they are turned on when they are major and controversial cases .	-3.0976
The process always takes place behind closed doors .	-1.6991
The body can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor 's Office to invite people to interrogate under Eid .	-5.2237
According to the CNN Sender , presentations revolving around meeting Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer have already been issued .	-2.8035
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement in the report .	-2.6737
They should also provide documents .	-0.7072
In addition to Trump ’ s Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were in contact with him .	-5.6690
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that Mueller was not intimidating in his work , and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .	-3.8894
But it is not necessarily the case that the Grand Jury will be shut down at the end to decide on charges .	-5.0165
Nevertheless , the establishment of the board of the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-3.7445
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.9687
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.3165
The subject gives the Democrats a chance to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.3100
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-2.8581
He pointed out that he worked in secret but also usually in secret .	-5.1083
The White House is in favour of any measures which accelerated the work of the special enquiry in a fair way .	-8.7644
The former FBI leader James Comey said three times that he would not be investigated against the president .	-3.2437
There is no reason to think that something has changed about that , it was said in the statement .	-4.7361
But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired .	-1.7521
Because of this pretext , accusations against Trump had become loud , he wanted to impede justice .	-4.3955
Comey stated in June before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.5444
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-1.7572
The White House collected material against the special enquiry and its staff following presentation of US media .	-3.8418
The speculation about whether Trump wanted to dismiss Mueller .	-2.3950
Unlike an independent congressional special enquiry , such as the Watergate affair around the then resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice on the part of the president .	-4.6464
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.3932
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that special investigators could no longer be dismissed as easily as possible .	-3.9990
Antarctica : Gigantic Eisberg drives in the Antarctica River .	-2.8748
In the Westantarctic , a giant iceberg dissolved from the Schelfeis by almost seven times the size of Berlin .	-4.5821
This was attended by the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday .	-2.8098
The coloss , which is heavy and 5800 square kilometres long , will now drive north and will probably need two or three years to melt .	-6.1359
With a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres , he is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-3.5693
He does not run a risk to humans .	-2.5549
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the break-up of the iceberg is unclear according to research .	-3.5038
Overall , however , it has been a series of unusual collapses of ice skelves in the region for some 30 years , and the US research centre for snow and ice ( NSIDC ) writes in a factual background .	-5.1991
Many researchers believe that this could be related to global warming .	-2.8339
The now broken coloss was part of the Larsen-C shelf .	-3.2512
Schelfeis swimming on the sea and is fed by big glaciers .	-3.5475
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .	-4.2950
The Larsen-C platform is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula .	-3.2763
Northern this feeling was interrupted by the balance of growth and disruption a few years ago .	-5.0063
A complete celebration was destroyed there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.3588
There is a lot to say that the Larsen C plate is also at risk , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-5.8737
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and could fall if a key point breaks off .	-5.5953
Melting of skin and iceberg does not increase sea levels , as they swim on the water and break ice as much water as it produces after melting itself .	-6.4852
However , the loss of the sky celebration leads the glaciers to the sea and go much faster than before .	-4.5717
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , the British research project to observe Antarctica ( middle ) .	-8.8903
The Larsen-C platform is the fourth-largest Antarctic Schelfeis after AWI statements with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-5.3220
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge of the free ocean about 200 meters .	-3.9862
There it regularly breaks down .	-2.0788
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now coming into a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.2390
" This is the most far-reaching withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.8225
Scientists should dispute whether the Larsen-C shelf will now grow back or go back in the long term , possibly united , his colleague , Adrian Luckman , said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-6.7288
But this development will take decades .	-1.4934
Although these researchers do not bring back the breakdown of this giant iceberg to climate change , in recent decades the Antarctic Peninsula has been covered by a large number of ice-cream shelves .	-6.6968
This long angle of the Antarctic extends towards South America .	-3.1579
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-2.8701
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline .	-2.2272
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed about three degrees over the past 50 years and is thus one of the areas where the temperature is rising most rapidly .	-4.0278
CDU wants house tariffs at the Personal Staff .	-7.4405
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy vacancies , the CDU is demanding to leave the employers ' association to become more attractive .	-4.6689
It was only just before the summer break that the district won 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.4267
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann . .	-6.2956
Once again , 17 trainees have fallen behind their first day of work .	-2.3460
The teaching places in the circle are obviously very desirable .	-3.1875
Around 620 applications were for the places to be awarded this year .	-2.6454
However , the circle still lacks staff to meet the increasing requirements and tasks .	-3.2792
There are still 50 unoccupied places with the Mettmann circle .	-2.1025
We are looking for doctors and engineers , as well as forces in general administration .	-4.1848
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in the champion of specialists in the administration .	-4.7944
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept of recruitment and human resources development .	-4.3555
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals but also to tackle shortages of applicants in the future .	-4.9028
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , concrete measures for cross-country entrants and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.4985
This sounds like a good approach .	-1.9947
Because the circle is faced with personnel problems that were not known before .	-3.1385
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-1.8865
The talk is about a right-wing ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.1589
In addition , there are a large number of employees who are eliminating illness or age from service .	-5.3058
So that is the best time to act so that we do not have more jobs left .	-5.0639
But Klaus Dieter , Chief of the CDU Group , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.6798
He recently created a bad surprise in a chapter when he publicly challenged recruitment costs and stunned the other parties .	-7.4974
Peoples want all possibilities to be reviewed , allowing local employers to leave .	-4.5479
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the circular administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should aim for a peoples ' .	-5.6927
This is what the CDU is trying to pay better for employees and officials than it actually provides for the public service tariffs .	-3.8411
The salaries are currently exactly prescribed , increases or more money can only be made by switching to a higher level oriented to occupational years .	-4.9831
But the challenges of the circle have grown ever more in recent years .	-2.7128
Only a few weeks ago , new premises were needed to deal with the provisions of the new Prostitution Protection Act .	-4.3039
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Martin Judge district have a problem : they have too little staff .	-3.8061
Italy is exacerbating the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats	-1.4614
Italy has warned NGOs who use the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue to do so unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-3.4370
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " said Minister of Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-3.3209
Minnit ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rescue Association , because its team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-3.9902
The aid organization , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to give its opinion on detailed accusations by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.1062
" For us , rescuing human life remains our top priority , so it is a great pity that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organisation in an opinion on social media .	-4.0653
" We can first assess all the allegations currently made after we have collected all the information and we can assess the situation . "	-4.3581
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the boat of ' Youth Rescue ' , Iuventa , since October .	-2.6449
It is suspected that its crew takes hose boot migrants on board , which are supplied directly by traffickers and that smugglers can leave , so that ships can be used again .	-5.6277
At least such a meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles outside the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosecutor 's Act , whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.2574
The crew is suspected of overlooking the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons , rather than any other motives .	-3.2986
Under the code of conduct , boats like the Iuventa must have , above all , an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-2.2770
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-1.8991
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable , because they would not entail ' major changes or disabilities ' of their bailouts .	-3.3965
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.2734
Minni has now said that in recent weeks , the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has declined sharply , suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.3031
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-2.2286
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who are hoping to reach Europe .	-3.6282
The Rise and Trials	-1.5418
Nine Weiler Biker , the " Berlin Outdoor Posts " and two visitors met in Wachenheim in the North Pfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-4.0783
We had three friends guides for this .	-5.3742
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley has proved to be a good starting point for tours .	-2.8636
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-1.6810
The first tour led to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-3.2557
They followed sights , partly on towers , of which you could see far over the woods and the stored plains .	-7.8971
In the meantime , there have been prolonged increases for which long trials rewarded .	-4.5934
On the second day , Bad Dürkheim went to the saline and the Volksfest sausage market .	-3.8313
Again there was a viewpoint linked to " flowering " trials and moderate increases .	-3.8196
The last two days had a lot of height meters again .	-3.2231
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks .	-2.7485
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers are breathing soles healing open-air content .	-4.3115
The city was also steered by New Tow. were .	-6.8924
After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the woods from its best side - sporting and cultural - .	-9.7048
Konsole instead of Rasen - Bundesliga fits for e-sport .	-3.4367
Are sports stars planning to run computer consoles instead of switching over the stadium ?	-11.4362
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gases .	-3.9805
This has also been recognised by the first Federal League Clubs to become involved in this field .	-5.3954
VfL Wolfsburg began in 2015 , followed by the FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and signed two professionals for FIFA 17 .	-4.8891
" We hope to inspire entirely new target groups for the VfB " , says Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.2618
He 's sure " that several clubs will rise on this turn " .	-3.8825
Next weekend , FIFA World Football Association in London will organise the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in which the gamers of different clubs will compete .	-4.0868
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.6337
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.5481
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.2924
" The real football must , in particular , deal with the 14-30-year-olds that young people will continue to stadium in the future " says the 52-year-old .	-5.8159
And : The associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.6850
With prominent e-sportsmen under the treaty , one could be present online much more often than once a year to send the Federal League team to Asia .	-5.1600
What exactly is this all about ?	-1.1002
At e-sport , computer games like " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or just the FIFA football simulation are being challenged at competition level .	-4.1115
Ligens have long established themselves , as in normal sport , in which professionals compete .	-3.6059
And in the 2022 Asian Games , e-sport is already part of the official programme .	-2.0950
But is this a real sport ?	-2.2644
For many , the idea is definitely needy .	-3.6132
Ingo Froböse has also long dealt with the issue .	-4.7698
For the professor at Deutsche Sports University in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competent and demonstrates many biological and physical reactions , which can also be found in the classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-4.8644
In addition , it needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid response capability .	-3.1320
Professional gamers should train not only on the console , but also on their bodies and respect the diet .	-3.7578
'The fiction player is a good player ' .	-1.9502
But frobous also sees problems : ' doping becomes more and more a subject ' .	-3.3375
Controls were hard to execute during online games , and classic sports were lacking in the scene .	-4.0044
The scientist positively emphasizes the high inclusive effect of e-sport .	-2.9562
Players are travelling internationally , as a large global family , there are no intercultural obstacles to this .	-3.7706
A study of the Deloits Company and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth for e-sport .	-4.1034
In 2016 , it had been implemented in Germany by EUR 50 million , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments .	-3.0534
In three years , sales will be 130 million .	-1.8219
This is not true of the EUR 2.4 billion in the Football Bundesliga .	-3.9331
However , e-sport " is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , the Deloitte consultants write .	-3.5533
Internationally , many countries are already on .	-2.3834
Great markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-Basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.4992
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-1.8945
There is also work to be done in Europe .	-2.3381
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a teaching machine , says Frobean .	-3.2011
According to Dutt , the first Football League clubs in the Netherlands and France are now obliged to set up an e-spordepartment .	-3.7934
" In European comparison , Germany is lagging behind , " says VfB Executive Board Röttgermann .	-3.2732
Only to fall into nostalgia and settle the old times is no longer enough .	-4.6299
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to organise it in the modern market .	-4.3046
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.1374

Toxic eggs - The egg alternatives to cooking and baking	-3.0357
Meanwhile , almost all the states have been affected by the scandal of toxic eggs .	-3.8089
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord responded and removed all eggs from the sale throughout Germany .	-2.8369
The shelves should only be taken eggs that have not been shown to contain a fipole .	-6.5535
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts pushing Conrad Roy to suicide .	-2.2944
A Massachusett woman was condemned to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend to suicide through texts and calls .	-2.6793
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been subjected to probation .	-2.8702
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on July 13 , 2014 .	-2.2266
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is unpleasant .	-2.7774
My son was my best friend . '	-0.9765
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-2.3735
She had been faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr. Roy suffered a mental disease .	-7.1633
Carter dressed in red pants and a creame-coloured blouse , with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downward eyes when convicted .	-5.7779
" Their actions killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.2851
" They ended his life to make their own better .	-2.1897
She did not assume any responsibilities ' , she said . , , . , , , , . , , , ,	-6.8944
" She has not shown a reveal . "	-4.5396
But Carter ’ s lawyer said that it was a ' terrible state of affairs that she totally regrets ' .	-3.8770
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find out that their " age or maturity degree , or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions " .	-3.6103
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy that said that there is ' no day on which I am not responsible for the loss of my beloved son .	-3.9735
I would like him to be proud of me and to deal with everything , and I am trying to be there for his sisters , despite all my pain that we will suffer for eternity .	-6.0762
Roy ’ s sister , Camdyn Roy , said she would be " persecuted " by the awareness that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother , or be a fiant for his children .	-7.5692
" No longer having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain I 'll always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.8845
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another person to commit suicide .	-3.1505
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.6435
The case attracted national attention after Carters revealed texts that it had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.6235
" Hold up , jumping of a building , create yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news that she had sent to death in the two weeks before his family while on holiday .	-5.9876
She wrote in the moments of suicide : ' You must do it , Conrad ' and ' Everything you have to do is disable the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.6935
Judge Moniz said that Carter attention was sought by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .	-2.9964
The case divided the legal opinion .	-1.4740
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British fellow citizens in Italy before being released two years ago .	-3.6303
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison ' .	-2.5749
Joshua Kimmich : Learning the new mini-lamp of the FC Bavaria	-3.3459
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmir was allowed to run up as captain at the Audi Cup .	-4.0920
The FC Bavaria trusts the Confed Cup winner a large season - Extra Motivation does not harm there .	-3.8328
Somewhat was different in his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even though the additional clothing was very , very small .	-4.1091
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel New to see , he continued to join the arm .	-5.7199
" The trainer hasn 't announced it , " the Confed Cup winner told her afterwards , after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain .	-4.4612
Well , the input could have gone better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-2.6834
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-4.8484
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player , but as a player , from young players , debutants and professionals just left out of the holiday .	-6.4156
The sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep their whims at the same time .	-7.5039
Those who have been chosen to take up the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-3.3534
Kimmich confirmed : ' That is what you as a player want to take responsibility ' .	-4.3212
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old fled the field as a mini-lam .	-3.4954
To the right , this is now its position , the white bond on the arm did its rest .	-3.3020
And Kimmich did anything about this start format like the one who could best take the ruder in his hand .	-7.1153
He gave instructions , attempted to direct the unbeatable troops .	-7.8584
He had the impression all while many others were busy with himself .	-3.6807
Vidal with overplaying its missing fitness ( hardly folded ) ; Renato Sanches with linking on devil to the services of the Asian trip ( folded even partly ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle did not appear negatively in their first appearance in the Bavarian Trikot .	-7.5184
That really folded quite well .	-3.1872
South ran off Kimmi , Rudy before the defense , both operated sovereign .	-4.9089
The well-occupied Napoli tower was often hard to do , and South also tried to succeed a few times in the game building .	-5.3145
Mr Rudy admitted that the result ' was not what we hoped for ' .	-2.9188
But he also worked well on the debut .	-2.8993
Removal of the game , Check of Tempo : ' I was chosen for this style too ' .	-5.7370
The unknown Bayer world for new entries was seen after the game .	-6.4276
For example , Rudy gave not one or two in the catacombs , but determined six or seven interviews .	-3.0107
Kimmym abandoned a few narrow statements on the back of his new players .	-4.7866
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-4.3327
At Bavaria , you just have to win every game " .	-1.9876
After all , he does not have to teach the new .	-2.6807
Alaba motivates ÖFB-Ladies	-1.2327
David Alaba believes in the success of our ÖFB ladies ' s success . , , , , and . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.8666
Austria ’ s most famous footballer reported about Twitter just before the game and wished all the best to the Austrian Footballer .	-4.8458
After all , the Bayern Legionary is almost a club college of ÖFB captain Schnaderbeck and feeds with our ladys .	-4.5981
The tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and Champion League winner should be a special injection of motivation .	-2.3985
The famous Bavarian dusel may well be needed for our ladies .	-4.2524
Businesses satisfied with Rhineland ’ s palace minister : Economics praises Wissings Tempo	-4.2738
It has often become unusual , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was an economist of the Rheinland-Palatinate .	-4.2353
This shows more than a year in which the new Economic Minister , Volker Kissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.6949
Chambers and companies from the region are talking about T V question from a change in economic policy - and at the same time tackle the old minister .	-5.5622
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked . "	-4.0457
Natus is the biggest turning point in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country 's list of priorities .	-3.9739
The ministry is still hoping for a planning process this year , until 2021 construction law will stand .	-4.1615
The western circumvention of Trier , which is in urgent need of the Federal Transport Plan , also plays a role in the country 's plans .	-5.0712
The goal is to start the course in December 2020 , says Secretary of State Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.0629
Natus sees it as a way to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-2.9908
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) is seeking , as suggested by Wissing , a Rhineland Pfalz label to increase sales in supermarkets and halt the trend of German wine exports , which has been stimulating for ten years .	-5.6115
In addition , knowledge has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , the IHK praises .	-7.0572
The Trier trade chamber sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.8356
A premium of EUR 1000 is planned for stockpiling and EUR 2500 if graduates become self-employed within ten years of the training of masters .	-5.9038
But the country remains a long list of homework .	-2.7937
The planned road construction is quick to create facts , while the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , the main business director of the IHK Trier .	-5.3886
Of 56 new engineers seeking to cease knowledge of mobility at local level , only 29 have so far been occupied .	-4.7479
The IHK is asking for more contracts to external offices .	-2.7027
CDU ’ s Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations from the Court of Auditors that , in 2017 and 2018 , the country invest more than EUR 20 million less in conservation of land roads than proposed .	-4.6680
Frank Natus also expects a country concept to be used to fix the region ’ s specialists .	-4.4473
It should also be disgusting to date that there has been a construction of broadband in the country .	-5.1160
In 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated net supply in an IHK poll with a note of 3.4 .	-3.2464
They complained about extensive Internet connections and interruptions .	-2.5436
In contrast , Foreign Minister Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the Pro Wind powerhouse .	-3.4717
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of inconsistency , she already cleared up the field .	-4.6868
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are faced with a backlash facing a backlash .	-3.5224
A day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.8670
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options as driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-4.1614
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there would be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.5455
None of the companies described companies as back-up .	-2.9097
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-2.5686
But the nitrogen oxide emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma .	-2.3602
The cost of automobile manufacturers to install equipment neutralising the exhaust gases exhausted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-3.5212
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with denying the powerful car companies and ignoring the signs of the problem .	-3.3427
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called set-off devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but where driving is normal .	-5.4937
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.6172
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-1.6705
The former manager , Zacceo Giovanni Pamio , is Italians and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to court in the United States .	-3.3330
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was expanded .	-3.9006
Including Audi in the investigation could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen 's profits .	-3.4014
This message has fallen on Saturday at Isar .	-3.1753
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-2.3310
For the visitors to Isar to take part , on Saturday morning there is a flood through Munich , which has a special message .	-7.2452
On Saturday , whoever draws to the isar , there will be a lot of fun between Flaucher and Reichenbachbridge .	-5.7383
And that is no usual walk with isar tourists .	-3.3612
The owner of the building referral was unveiled .	-7.6587
On the floor you see a large information transparent .	-4.2448
It shows a Müllberg .	-2.3133
The opening up to a public relations campaign to appeal to the visitors of Isar . .	-11.8107
With the slogan " True Love is ... " , the understanding of Isar as a protective wild flow is intended to strengthen .	-5.3837
Last summer the flood over Isar and this year too there are further actions and measures to achieve a sensible and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-6.0380
Mordillos noses and the Laughter Against suffering	-2.5852
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most popular cartoon drawers , the noses of his figures are his trademark .	-4.3035
Also with 85 the Argentine was still producing and working on a film .	-4.1344
His message : Laughter , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.6076
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.6164
In the first years as an artist , he proposed , among other things , as a drawer for congratulations cards - which frustrated him .	-5.0495
" The most happy day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-2.1235
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he managed to break in the late 60s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-7.3069
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-0.8588
The artist has always been inspired by cities .	-1.8530
Large , rounded mordillo figures stumble in drawings with the Pisa tower , Big Ben in London and the Red Place in Moscow .	-4.5827
According to his own data in the early morning , he is still on the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.0553
Through calendars , puzzles , books for both children and adults , t-shirts , plush animals and watches , its droll figures continue to be widespread worldwide .	-5.0604
He also worked on a character trick film and a TV series with his characters for six years .	-4.2665
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand fellow player as an opponent .	-5.0532
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will be recorded in 2019 .	-4.7784
" I don 't know exactly what they will say it is strange to me , " says Mordillo .	-1.9281
The script is not written by him .	-1.7710
So he is more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without wordless .	-4.5386
Provence ’ s Lavender	-1.6992
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-1.8686
The lavender is declining because of the conditions of drought and the insects transmitted because of the diseases , which is causing great headaches to scientists and farmers who are trying to find solutions .	-13.3876
Eric Chaise , the expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in the Provence , said : " The lavender in the Provence is in real danger because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change , which in spring has brought much less rain and much more in the autumn .	-5.4044
This has implications for the service life of Lavendel . . , . , , , , , , , , ,	-6.9352
There is also a small cigarette , a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cades , and there are many of them in very dry weather ' .	-4.2310
And the stakes are high .	-0.9820
Lavendel oil is not only attractive for tourists , it is also highly sought after by perfume and cosmetics .	-4.5605
Eric Chaise said : Instead of having very long plant mines with a large number of flowers , we have had smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.6730
So we have fewer parts with ethereal oil . '	-1.8265
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of soil degradation , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mix of tone and water , and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry conditions .	-5.1889
The town hostage in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200th anniversary .	-3.3421
The highlight is this Saturday and Sunday with a Middle Ages .	-2.7911
It is important to be able to experience this day in the city .	-10.6817
The assassination of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-1.1903
The Riodoce staff normally meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinoa by organised crime , corrupt civil servants , and unceasing drug wars .	-5.4462
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-1.9887
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.4565
Two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure : they should take their children into office , who in 2009 were the target of an attack with grenades , or let them go home .	-8.3109
Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : enemies , neutral allies .	-7.3168
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and feelings of belly .	-3.1458
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of standing on the government ’ s salary list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-3.4831
There is no break of violence , and , while the bodies accumulate throughout the country , more and more journalists have been present : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are attacked and threats under federal protection , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.9480
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration of Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.3064
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on drug violence .	-2.4913
His absence is deeply perceived , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " , depends on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-5.0861
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided themes , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-2.8848
Although a special prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , in accordance with the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , it has only initiated two criminal proceedings .	-4.6210
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.4407
They are still insisting , at Riodoce , on dealing with the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are unacceptable and are now treacher .	-5.8528
Without information about murderers , without justice , the meeting on security has little use , says Ibarra .	-2.4704
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop " , he says .	-1.7934
'Until we know why , we all mistrust . '	-3.1154
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-3.0249
He only managed to go a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men and was forced from his car and twelve times was shot on him , probably because the name of the new- ' ' twelfth ' ri' .	-6.3016
The shooter went away in his car and damaged it near .	-3.1545
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.5977
He left a woman and two adult children .	-0.8582
Rumors tend to fly freely in Culiacan .	-1.1433
But , on the subject of Valdez , there is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.2938
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and his extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival groups struggle here to fill the vacuum .	-3.5143
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot in the streets or that the graveyard is full of decorated , two-storey mousolees for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living .	-5.9618
Forget for one minute that there is a state of " peace " if only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug traffic routes to the United States .	-7.9127
Still , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , was blamed to fail to protect his friend .	-3.8052
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.0580
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel groups in war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.2721
This release may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought every copy of the output once it was delivered to newspaper kiosk .	-9.9063
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security , following the confiscation of another newspaper that had published the same history .	-3.2519
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . , and , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.0973
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.3172
In 2003 , he served as an experienced Noroeste Reporter , when he joined five members to establish Riodoce and sold $ 50 .	-6.0471
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to pursue journalism without encountering the drugs problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.7154
Over time , the newspaper earned a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.4562
Reporters loved to publish hard-hitting investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody otherwise dared to treat .	-3.6329
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-3.0115
In the same year , Valdez won the ' International Press Freedom Award ' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-3.1492
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.4172
" I want to continue living , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.4283
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life " , he said last October in an interview with Rompiveto TV .	-3.9080
" You must take the task that happens to you as a journalist - either that or you play the fool .	-3.2007
I would not be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.2869
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird , who could cure like a port worker , the friend who was generous with embraces and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-4.3412
They trusted his routine .	-1.6338
He would always bear his hat .	-2.5214
He would always go to El Guayabo , the office bar , and always sit on the same table .	-2.2194
Now they ask : was his love to routine his rubber ?	-3.9336
Her death has also forced her to question her own assumptions of how best to do her job and stay alive .	-3.6146
" You will not like to work with their women , their children , their clean business , their secret starting and landing trains " to move drugs .	-6.7956
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.9588
The result is a high degree of self-censorship and self-esteem , even in the best times . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.3540
Trust their own instincts .	-1.0292
If it is wrong , remain away .	-2.0045
The trouble , said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal , is that ' smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier ' .	-4.4003
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they are in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.9029
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.4897
Riodoce staff were suddenly not allowed to use mobile phones in the room where security training was sold ; days before it became known that spyware , sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-6.3031
Outside , two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.2871
They were instructed by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-3.4515
Half in joke , some reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of police officers who the governor himself called untrustworthy .	-3.7824
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.1052
Riodoce has leaked three main stories for this week 's edit. , and . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.6575
There was the murder of the brother of the former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.3870
They also had an exposé to government spending that focused on the domestic city of the governor .	-3.5100
And there was a group that executed a kidnap in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the Public Prosecutor 's office .	-3.4735
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so caution was commanded when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite place for drug dealers and authorities .	-4.3764
A reporter was informed of public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost the entire century all political levels .	-4.4684
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-class cases .	-2.1509
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.5263
Only a few months earlier , the readers would have regarded the Valdez Column as the best informed source of kidnapping .	-3.2891
" We already knew what happened " , said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its lean body status .	-3.0889
" Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . "	-2.3080
The Valdez office has been converted into the space of storage for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become what they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.3223
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-4.2171
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.0762
A burned body has been discovered and officials say based on DNA tests that it is his .	-2.6561
Throughout the country , journalists have become louder by writing on walkways and buildings in organized protests " SOS Press " .	-4.3193
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and attempts to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-6.8952
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they said the truth .	-3.2357
Since then , she has been asked to be reinstated by the government , because her anger has violated its objectivity .	-5.1712
Valdez has repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are " surrounded " by organized crime , interested government officials and an indifferent society .	-2.7258
In his last book , " Narco Journalism " , he wrote that reporters were killed not only by drug gangs , but also by commands from politicians and security forces who were under one ceiling with organized crime .	-5.0559
The media guard group " Articulo 19 " attributed more than half of the attacks on police and officials last year .	-3.1450
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth " , said Ramirez .	-2.5733
Obviously , the killings have a deterrent effect .	-1.6061
No one forgets the death of blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipa six years ago .	-2.7643
Your body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel : " Here I am because of my reports " .	-3.7339
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separated head .	-1.8895
Some branches have chosen to close , as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border of Chihuahua , after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.0024
Others continue , as El Manana did in Nuevo Laredo after the murder of their director in 2004 .	-2.5555
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the Drug Cartel with an editorial on the title page " What do you want from us ? "	-4.3207
Some journalists have fled from their homeland , or even from , countries .	-2.0338
It is a painful decision .	-0.6898
It is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the streets and are to to .	-7.9416
And sometimes they are hunted , as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City .	-3.5224
For those who are lagging behind and continuing work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.8832
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poets , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-2.3913
" Mexico goes to hell , so I was reporter , " he said .	-2.0092
To midnight last Friday , when the last issue had already been finished , the editors of Riodoce sat on the sideline at the office and drink beer , when all their phones started to sum up .	-6.4137
A number of shells with band rivals and security forces near Mazatlan bathing resort had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-4.0187
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-2.5696
From the Bordstein edge they have published the news on the Riodoce website via cellular phone .	-5.3623
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.3573
Sirenen noted near - another shooting in the area .	-4.5456
Bojorquez gave a look at the policemen who kept guards to see if they were willing to see .	-2.7628
If they were afraid they didn 't show it .	-2.2522
Riodoce ’ s employees followed his traces under the huge portrait of the newspaper ’ s fallen founder , whose middle finger was visible to all Sinala .	-5.6501
" How can you only remember this , " said Bojorquez , " when , on the same day that Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send her to the streets to reporting " . to ? . , , , , , , , , ,	-10.1357
Dinosaurs used disguise to escape their enemies	-3.2377
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening .	-1.9380
Researchers have now found that the first insights of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker were received so well that experts described it as a " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.3862
It was so good that they could even discover that his horrific skin was of reddish brewing - and they said it had had something of a " worrying past " .	-6.2812
The report in Current Biology described it as ' the best-preserved dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world ' .	-3.2421
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurian that lived in the middle of the cycle season between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.6981
His incredibly well preserved state has astonished researchers describing it as a " truly remarkable " , amazing .	-4.2340
According to National Geographic Reports , the best-preserved fossil of his species is the most preserved .	-4.6434
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grew up on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millennium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.7799
He met something that seemed misplaced in the place of the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.2429
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-1.7563
They spent the next six years revealing wild animals within the <unk> 2,500 <unk> ( 1,100 kg ) heavy natural clumps .	-3.0643
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.7500
" If you blink only a little of your eyes , you might almost believe it slept , " said Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-8.3815
" It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . "	-9.7238
Researchers found that even though it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank , the dinosaurs probably threatened by meat .	-4.4702
The highly pampered dinosaur used a red and white disguise to hide from predators , and used a brawling technique known as counter-intake , which is also used by many modern animals .	-6.2565
This would have allowed better mix into his surroundings and escape enemies , say experts , suggesting that major dinosaurs threatened it .	-5.6962
The 110 million year-old creature from the family of Nodosaurier made headlines in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.6240
Researchers have now studied wild animal and Borealopelta markmichelli called it the museum stechniker Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully revealing it . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.5586
The surprising preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , patterns and shapes and armor to document over his body .	-3.5905
She discovered countershadow , a common defense method in the animal , meaning that the tip of the creature was darker than its base .	-7.7957
Although counter-shade is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds those of today ’ s animals .	-3.8585
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by sufficient pressure by meat dinosaurs , that evolution favored confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.1613
But most contemporary animals using counter-shading - think of tranquillity , zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaurian was subjected to a real struggle for survival .	-4.8789
" Strong predator behaviour on a massive , heavily contaminated dinosaur show how dangerous the Dinosaurier predators of the Creative Age must have been , " said Brown .	-6.9156
Chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scale also shows that the skin of dinosaur was brown .	-8.8724
Scientists continue to study the animal 's evidence of his life , including his conservated intestinal content , to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-4.5808
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was brought into a river and driven to the sea , where he fell on the back to the seabed .	-3.8203
At that time Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further land as they are today .	-3.5247
" This nodosaurian is really remarkable because it is completely covered with conserved skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal " , said Brown .	-4.5625
" The result is that the animal now looks almost as much as it looks in the early cycle time .	-6.3426
You don 't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it , and if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you might think that it 's sleeping . ' .	-5.5193
The cycle time was a time when huge therropods , veat-saved dinosaurs , who stood on two legs , permeated the earth .	-6.1699
Although the king lived from them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , millions of years after Borealopelta , the panched dinosaur was driven by some of his dreadful ancestors .	-3.9898
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy monsters .	-2.6010
The scientists , whose most recent findings appear in the specialist magazine Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was sink after death in the sea and mummified in the mud .	-6.0861
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grew up on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.1558
According to the museum , it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snow to the hip .	-3.5062
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and went up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.0395
It contained two 20 customs long peaks advised by his shoulders .	-3.2969
Researchers believe that until a flooding river flooded into the open sea , the plant eaters were flooded by the Western Canada .	-5.1321
But the dinosaur ’ s underwater burial retains its armor in an exquisite detail .	-2.8684
The ancestral remains of this particular copy are so well preserved that the skin trests still cover holy tank plates along the Dinosaurian 's dinosto .	-6.5603
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is rarely like a winning lottery .	-2.9404
The more I see , the more confusing it .	-1.6767
Excessive remnants of the skin still cover the stirring tank plates that carry the pet 's skull .	-4.2764
His foreground right is on his side , his five fingers are priced upwards .	-4.1428

In the Mass Carambolage on A8 : Many injured .	-3.0271
A recent accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass mass mass carambolage .	-4.6167
There are numerous injuries , kilometre-long traffic jams and gaffers .	-2.6082
On the motorway Stuttgart-München ( A8 ) , around 20 people were injured at the late Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage .	-4.0665
According to the first information from the police , nearly 30 vehicles were covered between the connection points of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district Aichach-Friedberg ) during a guard , probably including trucks .	-13.0226
The exact number of injuries was not provided for .	-4.1845
They were light to medium-heavy injuries , a police spokesman said .	-3.5689
A large recovery ban was at the accident site .	-3.9267
The A8 was completely closed to Munich .	-1.2886
In Munich ’ s direction , an approximately 10 kilometres long Rünstau was formed .	-3.7675
As an AZ reporter reports , massive obstacles have also occurred on the counter-track as well - by many coffers .	-6.5718
Fire was noted by the marks of the drivers who now face sensitive penalties .	-4.9731
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.7639
There was a collision between a car transport and a car .	-3.3334
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident site .	-7.9449
Deutsche Bahn : Konzern tested " Comfort Check-in "	-1.1257
It is a moment that almost everyone has ever experienced : nothing you can eat in the train and sleep .	-4.1426
Or you are deeper in your work and have just a brilliant thought .	-2.4353
And then : bufff .	-0.5766
Come and awaken your passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-4.8684
ticket control .	-1.9243
But the times of interruptions are over soon .	-2.7571
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing free ticket control .	-3.1950
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and develop the ticket .	-4.6936
Test operation is currently running on two tracks .	-1.7018
" When the offer expands , we expand it .	-2.6591
It will probably be available at many other routes in Germany early next year , " said a train spokesman .	-4.2179
" Comfort Check-in " , the railway calls ticket depreciation without Schaffner .	-4.5998
In order to be able to use them , however , some requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-3.9005
And you have to book an online ticket - most passengers already do .	-2.9144
It also needs to be bought by the app of the train that DB Navigator bought , which is in any case the most convenient way of booking tickets .	-4.5761
Finally , you need a seat reservation .	-2.2720
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works this way : you get off the train and call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.6471
A button for electronic appreciation will then appear with the test customers .	-4.3281
The trainers get an alert on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and take over the booked seat Y . and . , and . , , and , , , . , , , , ,	-13.6233
When the train companion arrives at the ticket controller at Square Y , he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket already devised .	-5.7845
We can sleep , continue working , let alone sleep .	-4.0605
The " Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway , which in turn should use the passenger .	-3.5784
" If you want to travel by train with no ticket control , check in the DB Navigator yourself .	-5.0432
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personally during the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of Directors of DB .	-3.7177
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to their individual needs " .	-3.8090
Anyone who often leaves the train knows that , in addition to delays and trains missing , ticket checks are among the biggest troubles .	-5.7982
Often you have , in any case , one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to deploy online tickets .	-5.0098
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or otherwise a document to be presented .	-4.0214
The result is endless discussions between trainees and passenger , which leads to poor mood in the section or large and delays in controlling your ticket and , in the end , takes time for the crew to deal with other concerns .	-7.4862
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.7180
This is also only available in ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food .	-3.7144
Other numbers on the same route are not yet released .	-3.4502
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-2.2105
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrrell was shaken to its core .	-2.2344
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the St. Louis born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.7002
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-2.0050
" The police have just killed an 18-year child , and it is still on the street , " said there .	-3.5684
Confused as no one else posted the information on their feed , it closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.2302
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-2.8689
The rapper in the area of St. Louis was killing the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-olds killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo . .	-3.9887
He posted an image of Brown ’ s living body , which was stretched out on the street and would stay four hours there .	-4.1921
" That 's wild , " said Ferrell with you .	-3.6181
But death was nothing new to them and their community .	-1.3949
She left her mobile to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-3.8606
There were photos of the police band and people who wrote , and by a man who claimed to be browns father who wore a shield with the label : " Ferguson 's police have just killed my unarmed son ! "	-4.3697
She observed a live feed where a police stood before a group of demonstrators with a belling dog .	-3.1935
In another video , she said , another police deprived his gun and cried : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-3.8250
Ferrell reminded her of what she said .	-3.3009
" This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can typically call it . "	-4.0449
At this moment I felt shaking frost .	-2.5803
I was angry and cry . '	-1.4141
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.8553
After the landing at 23 p.m. , she retired her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-3.8994
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from 11 .	-6.1077
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that consists of the view of the people who live in the community and who have filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.0605
When Ferrell and her daughter , who went a flower dress and a suitable crown , they spoke to Ferguson , they spoke a conversation that innumerable times before this morning » about the black experience and black state « .	-5.0570
" Do you remember how I taught you when black people will have to fight for what they believe in ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.2791
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed an 18-year-old boy and it was not right .	-3.0272
I couldn 't take it on , " said Ferrell later .	-3.4797
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-1.5694
They need to know it , they need to see it and they need to be brought up in it .	-3.7684
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and black constitution , and what we need to do to be released to free ourselves .	-3.9049
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience any blatant racism , she is not unlike the next black woman child .	-4.3713
I feel I would do it a bad service to keep it outside . '	-2.7871
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was the South Florissant Road , a place facing the police authority that became a camp when the activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.3021
Ferrell and her daughter associated with a local business owner who made lunch .	-3.1415
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.1985
Slowly , a new kind of activism began to take shape for Ferrell .	-2.7125
" My activism changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri , Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.4560
" I had no experience organizing .	-1.2168
They have all come . '	-2.5794
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.8659
Folayan said that she and her camera Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to document what happened .	-2.4219
One question came to mind : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.2460
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often by whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-2.9007
As Folayan recently said in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and grew up in Ferguson had not centred their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.6409
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around death ract inmates .	-3.8671
Ferrell 's commitment to the project was closer , together with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's decision .	-5.6814
" This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us .	-2.7032
" This was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , for that is how I shall be represented . "	-3.5512
The aim was not to focus on Ferrel 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messiah leader , but a community that comes together " , Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-4.6229
As a result , documents by " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrel 's life , as she feels in love and marries her wife .	-4.3994
" I felt like naked , " Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.7145
" But I understand that there has to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-8.2620
In addition , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black live matter movement .	-3.7112
Two of the three founders of the movement , which , following the killing of the black Teenager Trayvon Martin , shaped the film " BlackliveMatter " in social media in 2012 , identify as gay .	-3.7549
" Black , gay women in management positions have borne the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-3.2435
Black , gay women have to bear the main burden of everything . '	-2.2301
Folayan agreed to note that ' the movement is maintained by black women and many black women ' .	-2.9520
However , she insisted that " this is not an affirmative type of action " , where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.6714
" She was the person who fueled this energy , " she said .	-2.8922
" It is no coincidence , even though she was at the forefront , because there is so much at stake in a life at these crossings as a black , gay woman .	-9.1795
You can feel their energy through the screen ' .	-2.4771
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial links between the municipality and the police remain .	-6.8302
Ferrell is at the same time a demonstration is required to block a motorway for two <unk> years .	-6.1853
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-2.3712
Nevertheless , she looks closer to a song and feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-4.9817
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.7249
It is our duty to win .	-0.7806
We must love and support each other .	-0.8226
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-1.3024
From " Dream " to " Größwahn " : TV readers discuss bit-gallery .	-8.3025
The Bit Gallery is moving people even though it is not yet built .	-3.6971
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone divides the population of supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.1133
The topic is hardly one .	-3.2535
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksöhn Bitburg " .	-4.4427
Whereas those of you say to the Bit Gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be true class " ( Nicole Shots ) , comes from the other side : " Don 't need a human being " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Greater Way ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-7.7853
While supporters are building a gallery to attract more clients , which also benefits the other business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then blood .	-5.7508
In addition , the gallery is planned precisely on the plot where the farm market hall , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-4.1699
That will stop as the construction works begin .	-2.5260
The Gallery Machers want to integrate a market hall in the new construction - for Beda Square with possibility to open the outside .	-5.8195
Simone Zimmer : " We have been shopping for many years in the farm market hall almost weekly .	-3.5808
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farms .	-3.9585
We also discovered the butcheri for us .	-2.7942
We would like this offer to be maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-3.4275
Other cities have that .	-2.5330
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-2.5215
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , the rental level is high .	-4.2858
It seems that they are not very low in the new project ' .	-4.0297
Eva Kilic : " Why Shopping Packages in Bitburg ?	-9.1945
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-2.2099
There is enough of this in our city .	-3.7347
You can see how many shops are empty here - some have been around for months and years .	-3.4430
But since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall .	-3.6342
After all , the products offered there are fresh , mainly offered by the producer and are cheap .	-4.7279
As you can see , shoppers in a shopping centre are only hired by larger companies , because rents are often not acceptable for a retailer .	-5.2169
It is a pity , special deals almost no longer exist and what is left of it will probably disappear . '	-5.0248
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall doesn 't fit for me .	-2.5137
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.5117
Above all , where is the peasant market hall supposed to be during construction ?	-3.1427
The old Edeka would be the solution - even if the Bit Gallery actually comes into effect at some point .	-4.4543
Or does the Ghost Bit Gallery manage to distribute all the deals from Bitburg beforehand ? '	-4.4409
George Marquet : " That simply will not work .	-1.1997
And a shopping centre that stands empty , no one needs .	-2.6600
In my opinion , it would have been better to promote a proper farming market than this gallery .	-3.7015
But for a farm market hall there is no place anymore thanks to the madness of many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-4.3761
When the farm market hall is broken , a culture will disappear again . '	-3.2075
An appropriate similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.5864
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost impossible - on the ceiling .	-4.2812
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wange Tupfers and Haarcut , who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-5.1804
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth , where former intelligence analyst committed a 35-year-old sentence after being publicly classified as secret diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website .	-5.7200
The new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A fi) .	-3.5965
She is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer sciences , and art , and Manning , a Transfrau , and the dissident whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-4.8050
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA , which was extracted from Manning and from the 30 portraits of how someone could look like these genomic data , has created a sharp , albeit slightly intellectual comment not only on the formality of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-6.2472
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but already spoke openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the Spion Law , computer fraud , and theft .	-3.6796
Through the prison , her image was suppressed so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black and white self-figure , where Manning is clearly uncomfortable in a driving seat and a platinblonde pearl - with which it was associated .	-7.4387
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of its 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.1046
Here , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigarette and chewing gum by extracting the DNA out of waste to see how these people might look .	-5.1271
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.2555
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press review of the new exhibition .	-3.6898
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-4.5928
The artists and their imprisoned museum became uneven walkers who have been exchanging letters for two years .	-5.3752
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , forecasting a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and able to view the exhibition personally .	-3.7449
The fact that Obama was , indeed , just a few days after the book was published , calling for Mannings ’ release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome way of meeting .	-4.4393
There is also some deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against officials from the government camp and against transgender forces to find new , tweakable ways to unleash the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .	-5.8509
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-2.5796
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning , with its overwhelming signature , including ( the " i " in her family name is with a heart ) an end to " automatic fragmentation of which have been the basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-5.8600
The opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand folder of Cs and Gs and As , written in pencil .	-2.9857
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by integrating the 200 letters ( or nuclear ides after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) how amazingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-3.3152
" What people hopefully will take with it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.5101
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so they are 30 of these stories . "	-2.5089
The last piece of the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is one of the aforementioned comic novels .	-4.3911
She shows manning how she looks up with a free speech phone in the hands of the disciplinary barracks in the United States like King Kong .	-4.7176
" When they cold your speech , they win " , says .	-3.3874
" So never the mouth " .	-2.9963
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist , who greeted from Philadelphia .	-2.1327
" I still get gold-watching when I talk about it . "	-3.8245
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - as it was foreseen in the comic book - but if it was to do it , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , from its own genomic simulacrs , who sharpened together like hordes of protesters .	-6.3711
This was also targeted like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 " , Mannings Statur ) , in which their genetic hapless groups were written with a pencil .	-4.7312
" In the past I had them at the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd of men , " said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits .	-3.6327
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement behind its liberation . "	-2.8819
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee at the University of Oxford are looking for killing .	-3.6029
A national hunt is taking place in the course of a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford , who are sought as suspects after a man was born in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries .	-5.8840
On Monday , for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as demonstrated by the acts of the Official Court of Cook County .	-3.8952
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several samples .	-2.5926
A common warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on July 27 .	-2.5099
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments , and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.5667
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead on the site of events , and detectives investigate the boots as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , said officials .	-5.0311
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-1.9675
Alan K. Cubbbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an email declaration that Lathem has now been deprived of entering the Northwestern University campus .	-4.3275
" This is now a criminal issue investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " Cubbbage said .	-3.1673
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-2.0598
A spokesman of the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that ' we are in contact with the UK police and willing to help US investigation agencies in every way possible ' .	-4.3645
The statement added that Warren 's colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up .	-2.9255
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urged suspects to confront the authorities .	-3.0154
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize it reinforce , " said Guglielmi .	-3.0582
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-2.0232
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a remarkable tip saying that something had happened in flat 1008 .	-3.9380
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.1428
Guglielmi said that it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.4239
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.0611
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .	-1.7718
The management team of Grand Plaza issued a declaration to the inhabitants : " The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and are exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-4.7824
" We will finish the WADA roadmap in the near future " - Russian vice prime minister Mutko .	-2.8665
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it would not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.3204
" RUSADA has been entitled to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) at a particular stage of meeting the criteria of the road map .	-3.7843
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-1.8507
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code , which describes the criteria for redeploying RUSADA and recently published on the organization 's website .	-3.7367
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern .	-1.9699
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-2.1268
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.1359
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the WADA investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.9809
In relation to the matter , Mutko said : " We conduct the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake .	-3.7969
All measures have been implemented .	-1.2559
But there were no public programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-3.2357
Mutko 's words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-2.6111
When talking to the Russian sales station RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov gave rise to problems in the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules .	-4.7535
No one has any idea of unconditionally accepting this report ' added Smirnov .	-2.9463
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal . , .	-8.2816
However , they were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.1038
Following a visit to the main quarter of the Organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Nigli declared that RUSADA is moving in the right direction " to be re-deployed .	-3.8978
Aldi is no longer selling eggs for the time being .	-2.7258
That was shared by the group of companies .	-2.6344
It was a purely precautionary measure that no health hazard could continue to be considered in the communication .	-4.7798
It is now likely that only eggs are delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to be tested negatively for fipoly-containing anti-noise agents .	-6.7044
Aldi intends to clarify and transparency with his customers .	-6.5557
Start ups that will help your company not become the next Uber .	-2.9892
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness at your e-commerce start up , but the polls did not work .	-2.5461
Answers were often vague , little helpful , or - worse - fraudulent .	-2.0100
Even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.6723
" There was simply no consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-3.3414
She has called people from outside for help .	-1.6522
A new breed of human resource start-ups is growing in order to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.6807
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring the employee 's commitment , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to address specific groups and demographic groups , to offer anonymity and complaint hotlines to employees , and in some cases whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and apply directly to the board .	-5.3996
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the fitness for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analysis tools are used by companies to measure commitment .	-4.6806
Errett said that she gave a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-4.1435
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of specific teams , it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance what units have most complaints and which executives have low assurance results - so that you can redrill why .	-5.4412
Companies get to see that at the top of the culture of employment must remain , so that you do not become the next button involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished .	-5.9457
For start-ups like Glint this desire for an overview is a lucrative business possible .	-2.7147
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Financial Site Let 's Talk Payments .	-2.8577
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity early this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit .	-4.0298
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-6.6747
Uber recently registered as a client .	-1.3610
Like Glint , Convercent Enterprise lets you send tailor-made " puls- " surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-4.3292
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline , which enables people to report bad behavior .	-2.9682
And when the main business leader is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.8799
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-3.0496
When a company is found badly treated or unethical , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycotts , workers fluctuation and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.2355
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of the policies and procedures and have an easy way to reach their company 's centre .	-4.8727
Previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company ’ s central , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.0615
It was often intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-3.2997
Now that the Company uses Convercent , problems that were hidden by executives in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practices .	-5.0387
" I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who runs the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.1710
'And we protect our shareholders against employment and legal disputes ' .	-2.5774
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002 , after Arthur Andersen ’ s accounting company collapsed through the Enron scandal for ethical violations , said Quinlan .	-3.6638
But it took until the ' social media came to their right ' that companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty lingerie from going online .	-3.8028
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.6720
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-3.6954
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the assent of venture capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-2.5783
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , increasing all capital to $ 47 million .	-2.8775
Glitzer secured $ 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all its funding to $ 60 million .	-3.3674
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.2506
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done to date .	-3.4058
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only interventions .	-1.9449
Employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.5970
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worth doing , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.4858
Investors yield yields when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are deployed and committed .	-3.8452
If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase employee commitment and use , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.4428
Data about employee involvement according to the experts in the workplace culture .	-7.5960
But the data is useless unless a company 's managers take action .	-3.3822
In fact , when a company asks staff to your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-3.4961
And if change does not come fast enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and discourage employees .	-3.8251
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies too much rely on data collection .	-4.6856
" For if you don 't follow someone will ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.8075
Are you looking at this ?	-1.8716
And who do you not care about why should I ? '	-2.6022
Madison Reed , now conducting monthly staff surveys , was able to initiate measures on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , so save .	-3.8687
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to address problems .	-4.2722
At Ruby Tuesday , the company always gains new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this will lead to better ties between workers in a sector known for high sales .	-4.6922
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , " said Vitrano .	-1.5853
" And when you lose people , you lose also customers .	-2.1343
And if you lose customers , you will lose business .	-1.8841
NCAA eliminates the two day practices and makes a long day for the bruins .	-3.7570
It 's up to 23 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-4.6404
Some have extracted their tricoting parts and demonstrated the backs of the first day of the training camp .	-4.3548
For a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .	-2.2144
Players registered for summer courses will return to their final tests after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Water Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 a.m. .	-4.2649
" This is a real tretmill for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before the Monday became Tuesday .	-3.4953
The NCAA eliminates two day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .	-7.9520
This is why UCLA 's first three training courses should start at 19 : 15 p.m. to meet the players ' already packed timetables .	-5.0287
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins delayed the start of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school performed practical exercises for the first time during Moras ’ s six match times in westwood .	-5.3681
The course will hold 18 exercises during August , 20 prior to the start of formal game preparations for their launch against Texas A & M in September .	-6.2404
Mora said that he will support NCAA change , even if they add another point to the multiple Player routes .	-5.3074
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.9680
" And they have simply pressed it , they are still stuck , they are great people .	-3.5112
I think that when we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-3.0066
UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished , which will not be easy given the clear sights of its fields from an adjoining parking lot and the adjoining Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been used with footballs , which have been granted a protective net behind a gate post .	-8.0342
Starting from this weekend , Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-4.5575
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.8496
" This is a real problem , and it is not a foregone to think that people there rent a room and then adjust to record an exercise .	-4.7310
If you have the video of a exercise it is quite a good deal .	-2.4761
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.3972
We will do the best with what we have .	-0.8756
I am therefore not too much concerned .	-2.8314
We have a plan . '	-0.6596
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit news .	-2.3434
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake messages to fact-checkers of third parties and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world 's largest online social network on Thursday .	-5.9397
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and send them to factual verifiers that might be showing the results of the fact test from the original article .	-6.5059
Facebook was criticised as one of the main points of distribution for so-called fake news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .	-6.0899
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooding false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to manage hate-fulfilled postings as they were before the September elections .	-9.3506
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.1230
" In addition to recognizing the stories of factual checks of third parties , people want more context to make sound choices about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook News in a blog .	-3.8137
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the " related article " and will work on other changes to his message feed to reduce false news .	-3.4263
Create a comic novel : A castle in the history of England .	-1.8883
Margaret Thatcher was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s .	-3.6934
But Scottney has witnessed 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a fashionable Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-4.2395
" I find it so beautiful to look at the manual of someone who has been dead for 300 years " , he says forgiveness .	-3.6445
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-1.4372
'A Castle in England ' covers the time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward , documenting the families that lived in Scotney .	-5.0449
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotional .	-7.1132
" I only reacted to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-3.7924
" That is his thumb print !	-2.0333
And letters always smell after smoke , for they ignored a fire because of the light .	-3.8166
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he had himself .	-3.0321
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.1309
For someone who was beaten with ancient papers , who was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued " ) this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-5.4191
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , browsing through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted heads at the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-4.4400
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the ancient castle and spoke to landscape maintainers , gardens and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book . , , , , , .	-6.5734
Then , at night drink he " Whiskey and began writing " .	-2.2786
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust died only in 2006 when the last inheritance , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.4715
When Rhodes met a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive , which he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , thrown it on the roof " . , , , , , . , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.5091
Diaries , letters from the time of English Empires , maps representing who had what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-4.2629
Guys , let it go ! '	-3.3106
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as the starting point to discover in English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labour ' , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm 's uprising of 1381 .	-4.4172
" There is a record of a retirement which took place in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-4.0142
" The insurgency began in this area and I thought an insurgency was a good start .	-2.9049
Perhaps the two are interconnected ? '	-1.6954
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as The Priest , which tells the history of the Jesuit Pater , which the Darrell family hid for seven years during English reform .	-4.2009
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the juggler Arthur Darrell was depicted from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was digged ) .	-5.2647
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : " The men seemed to be fairly gaunerer , keep making debts , and spending money on things they could not afford .	-4.4807
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marriing wealthy old women - I imagine them as a cluster of sounding boys , with a talent to advertise crops . '	-8.9873
After the end of his work in the castle Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-6.7500
He has spent a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel on Elämäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early twentieth century , which has since been called back by nature .	-4.8352
But Scottney has a special place for him .	-1.4918
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-0.9176
It was like ' Oh , now I must be done with the condemned life ' .	-4.2309
The campaign starts : More than 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hulls out .	-5.5925
Bad Honnef has launched its campaign on Friday to launch a new roof mark ( round show from Thursday ) with the coverage of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-4.7968
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-6.8172
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.1672
" Too nice for us .	-1.2772
Or ? " , ask the makers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorf chapel .	-3.2151
" We don 't think this really " , they write on their website that was released yesterday .	-3.7946
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.1871
And to make it clear that some people are better than they appear .	-1.9803
Basically , we are firmly convinced that as a bath Honneer citizen we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.0887
The action is more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-2.8147
" We must formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . "	-4.8673
After all , they compete with other communities .	-5.5743
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a mid-five-digit amount its new roof mark and the campaign .	-4.2837
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan 's fear of the army	-1.5121
Every beginning of August , Ankara ’ s Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises about retirement and promotion in officer corps .	-3.5064
That , too , is this week .	-2.3621
At first glance a normal process .	-1.4665
But nothing is routine among the Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.0775
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff as before , but at the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.5837
The five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Internal Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs participated in the discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government .	-4.2151
The YAS civilians were thus overwhelming .	-2.7197
The government is pulling the reins in the military .	-2.6281
Although Hulusi Akar remains in office , the army commanders , the air forces , and the Marine were dismissed .	-4.7566
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and Admirale .	-2.4106
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , which Erdogan sees as the wizard of the coup attempt .	-4.6331
This week , Ankara has been negotiating against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-4.4432
The day after the coup , Erdogan called the overthrow attempt to be a ' gift of God ' , because he gave him the opportunity to " clean up the armed forces " completely .	-6.2342
But has Erdogan really handled the army ?	-1.3714
At the end of February , the " Hürriyet " newspaper published an article entitled " Military Headquarters " .	-3.3333
The General Staff was concerned about the growing ' Islamization ' of the army , which was manifesting , among other things , the lifting of the banned headscarf for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-5.5458
Big cleaning goes on with the army and the security forces .	-4.0410
In mid-July , Erdogan , by decree , fired another 7395 public servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-4.1624
Yet Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military .	-2.4160
The generals used to be the real masters of the country .	-2.3138
They appealed three times for their role as guardians of the secular national order .	-4.2270
After his victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the military ’ s power gradually back , not least on the European Union ’ s reform targets .	-3.9093
Former officers say Erdogan is targeting Islamization of the Armed Forces .	-2.4107
In the Vocal Europe magazine , a not-so-called officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt , fearing persecution abroad , would be the Turkish army in a few years ' full of extremists and salafists ' .	-4.8018
If that is the case , NATO could not allow such a development to be cold .	-4.6777
Without that , according to cleansing , there are doubts about the willingness to use the Turkish army .	-3.8069
The leadership structures and operational abilities are ' weakened ' , say Nato diplomats .	-2.5261
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules	-1.4061
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.7530
It provides for lower legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-3.0884
The new rules are proposed and supported by the Republicans .	-1.4674
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-1.6784
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are spent green cards . "	-3.1819
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-0.8084
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and demonstrate the knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-3.6203
Ministry wants to clean up the race track for the race shuttle .	-4.7025
Over the past few months , the future of the racing race shuttle has been stopped - now it is very fast .	-6.4221
It is planned to be built by the end of the year on the maroen route which runs the tourist path .	-7.4348
In order to ensure the future of the race shuttle in the long term , construction will begin this year , according to the Transport Department .	-5.8229
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route Ilmenau-Rensteig , the country commits itself to this important link for tourism , " declared Secretary-General Klaus South on Friday in Erfurt .	-5.8814
The cost of repairing the route was around EUR 2.5 million .	-1.9589
Of that sum , the country took 75 % .	-1.4413
The contract on which the shuttle will be ordered from the country in future will be finally voted , declared South .	-4.5719
The Ministry of Education and the Südthüringen Railways are already in agreement on the technical details .	-4.1595
" As a result , the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.3397
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years .	-6.4124
The race shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-2.4703
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular tourist rail link between the Ilmenau and Rensteig stations .	-4.2187
Over the past few months , pilot operations have tested whether enough people can use the route to order it regularly in the future .	-5.3713
The course is also extensive in parts .	-3.1888
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it .	-1.3547
Precisely when you thought it could not be further crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robotics is coming .	-6.2259
Yes , in fact .	-0.8357
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment .	-1.6356
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-1.5572
According to Noel Sharkey , a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-2.3478
Customers can choose the robot ’ s eye color , its form of breast warts and the type of fingernail .	-3.4364
" People get funny about them , but companies deliver a lot of it , and we will get them even more often , " said Mr Sharkey said in publishing his new report .	-5.6003
Modern sex puppies have evolved from their invisible partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warmly - with deliberately human reactions achieved by the artificial intelligence .	-3.8721
The user can also " adapt " his robot according to his convictions , selecting everything from the robot 's eye color to the form of breast warts to the type or color of its fingernails .	-4.2562
But it becomes even more disturbing , because many robots have the " personalities " that a Stepford woman would look progressive . , , , , and , . , , , , , , , ,	-8.9842
Modern sex puppies have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.4280
For example , the RealBotix robot enables users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as shock absorption .	-3.3269
And then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shock and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-3.7663
" Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is almost customized to your personality , " warms the site of True Companion .	-4.0569
So she may what you like , and she doesn 't like what you like , etc .	-3.1130

There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the subordinate female characteristics , the allegations of rape when one goes to Frigid ( meaning : reluctant ) Farrah worry the most .	-5.0589
On his website compared True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.0703
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men then have no Roxxxy ? " said it on the site .	-3.8252
However , these sex robots are not only a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.8513
Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex subjection as an optional addition .	-4.1764
Most men will not , of course , keep sex robots , and while the FRR notes their rising popularity , they remain temporarily at the edge of consumer culture .	-7.5917
But what leaks out of the peripheral zones can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.1327
And many people are not strange or insulting until they have permission from the free market .	-2.8745
There is a certain overlap , however , that these advanced sex robots emerge at a time when women ’ s rights are threatened worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who boasted to have attacked women sexually .	-4.9543
The most horrific aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Magd Report ' ) are not the graphic images , the swallowed body and the infinite eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.6612
The Republic of Giled is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .	-2.5582
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with pornostar proportions ) .	-3.0983
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they copied the movement of a real body .	-2.8836
But , when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots are not really women .	-2.4800
They cannot separate from their pet or simply go away .	-2.4429
They have no conciliation or background history , no indication of independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-3.5802
In other words , they are fake slaves .	-1.7418
Or , in the 2017 speech , to put it millions of .	-7.0206
Trump ’ s Great performance ?	-1.7724
He makes Mitt Romney a conception of common sense .	-5.2720
It has become a tribute to the Trump era that the political divisions that the US electorate has polarized have also divided families in small format .	-4.1246
Around Christmas and Harvest Festivities , there were newspapers in the US about how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s selected relatives .	-10.0713
We all supposedly strike to plunge our filter bubbles .	-2.7896
Less noted is Trump ’ s power to bring together families .	-1.8466
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been engaged with the Republicans in our family , visited me in New York this week .	-3.1638
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .	-1.7410
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the Republican killings she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly on the same side .	-3.6281
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but it strikes me in a broader context that entails considerable risks .	-5.1772
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s daunting effect has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.5138
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the cruel possibility that one day his gifts will no longer be offset .	-3.6987
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump ’ s right-wing Republicans are " normalized " , which suddenly seem to be an embodiment of reasonability when compared to his standards .	-4.9696
I nowadays find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of the madness - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration was expected ) - both of which occur as a very mild crime relative to Trump .	-6.9157
When Trump goes , the Republican candidate ’ s next must be intellectual healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.4438
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Carussell in Central Park , the largest of the carousels of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-4.8892
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are ridiculous and the animals are distorted to watch their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and climbing music gives this in a strange way .	-6.0705
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the Skylines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-3.8065
Thirty and five years later , and I 'm still not entirely out of the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is in fact not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not - but a major circle traffic in north London .	-10.3084
The Central Park Carousel , however , is still a strange magical experience , since there are two years of experience , a 11-year-old , and two women in the 40s and all have a great time .	-5.4540
If I could have rated the Karussels , I would have given him the full number of points , but , fortunately , nobody asked about it .	-4.6666
On the other hand , this week in a store , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could cross my credit card .	-2.9169
In the coffee house on the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option of comparing the assessment with a 15 % drinking money - this to buy something about the store .	-6.0709
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where there is no need for it .	-3.8324
The poor woman at the department store was grinning , while I tired of getting my credit card with five stars .	-4.7723
Oscar Pistorius moves from prison to hospital with chest pain .	-2.0741
Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.3147
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of straits to his hands , which , according to prison authorities , he suffered after a case in his cell .	-5.8716
Pistorius was condemned against a first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors .	-3.3036
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine Day in 2013 , shouting her on several occasions by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-4.5952
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nightmare hiding in the cabin .	-3.9066
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-3.2675
The National Criminal Prosecution Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .	-3.4433
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful .	-3.1819
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8596

On Tuesday evening , schoolhead Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Beisenhaus in Epfenhofen .	-4.1660
As a symbol of the dismissal , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grows up in the chicken courtyard but will then be released into freedom .	-4.7165
The munder Schar led a musical entitled " The eagle at the chicken court " .	-4.5704
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it erupt from his chickens .	-7.6154
Instead of a chicken a little eagle came out .	-2.2959
But the hope of making a hull of him disappeared , the eagle spread out and dismantled his wings on a high mountain .	-5.0647
The classes then showed three and four in the studies of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-3.2932
The hens danced with the young gocks that wore cylinders to the bet .	-3.3364
The eagle is in favour of integration , said Schulleister Angelika Sitte .	-3.2902

I would like to thank my fellow Members , the former Head of School , Michael Müller , who repeatedly attacks on teaching passports and the parent representatives .	-6.3696
The cooking time is over , explained classroom teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.0469
She dismissed her students after two years of teaching very reluctant , for it was a really great time .	-4.2861
Finally , it was able to rely on the fourth plaintiff .	-2.9237
In conclusion , all students had a song of summer and holiday time .	-5.6761

On the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegal camping people in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.3787
On the same day , they were released while an inquiry is ongoing .	-2.1294
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the bulgars were released later .	-2.0450
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and put substantial fines on anyone who is found in a place that is not intended for that purpose .	-3.6809
The controls are continued throughout the season .	-1.9870
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .	-2.0855
Software update for diesel vehicles : What people now need to know about themselves . !	-6.9870
How exactly is the software update taking place ?	-1.1630
Do diesel drivers need to take part in the action ?	-1.7547
The most important questions and answers in the overview .	-2.3443
At the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-1.8305
They are supposed to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the emission classes of Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 .	-4.0635
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.3811
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe has assessments :	-2.4469
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.2503
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-0.9537
" The obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have melting software " , says Anja Smetanin .	-2.9035
The Federal Railway Office ( KBA ) has ordered its retrofit .	-4.2536
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-1.4773
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but have not yet called a precise date .	-4.2427
Daimler has communicated to write to each person concerned .	-3.0858
If an inspection is already due , it will be done within its scope .	-3.1842
How long will the overall turnover move ?	-2.8520
" Schwer to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.0689
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure .	-1.7706
'Because we have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment so far . '	-3.5999
How long will the update take ?	-0.9843
The rearmament itself may take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.4119
Time expectants may be to have an appointment .	-3.9021
What are the drivers driving no car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-7.7524
The ACE advises you to wait .	-1.1193
Smetanin argues that this would attract foreign manufacturers .	-4.1343
Does a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-8.8078
The ACE fears this .	-0.7555
But precisely in regions where prohibition is threatened .	-2.7740
In rural areas there have been no loss of value for older diesel .	-2.4158

LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award ceremony .	-1.9693
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington .	-6.3747
The first award under President Trump promises to be politically .	-2.3518
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.4356
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the sought-after awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-3.0772
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and Norman Lear ( 95 ) TV producer are among the revolutionaries .	-8.9917
The awards will be forwarded at the beginning of December .	-1.8009
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will reception and take part in the award with his wife Melania .	-2.4424
The Lear prize winner , known with progressive television series , has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-5.9695
He said to the New York Times : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to remove them - and this burdens me ' .	-4.8745
The 59 year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the talks with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.3673

Roland Wacker , Haslachs Stadtbauster , retires next year .	-3.8098
The place is already outlined , but suitable candidates are rare .	-4.4713
For 31 years , Wacker has been the city master .	-2.9796
And the work still makes him great fun as he presents in the press discussion .	-3.6695
He reports diverse , but also demanding , tasks that await his successors . . , , , , , , , , and , . . , , , and he . , ,	-11.0544
At the same time , it is surprised that , until now , no application meets the requirements profile .	-4.3021
The city is searching for an architect or building engineer at the earliest .	-3.2315
So there is still plenty of time to be involved , taking into account the regular cancellation deadlines .	-5.5705
Since Haslach serves as a sub-construction law authority for the administrative community , the Applicant must show appropriate accounts .	-5.9264
Because this function certainly wants to retain the town .	-5.8796
If they could no longer be completed , they would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-4.2927
But proximity to the city and its importance is said by Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and good sentiment between authorities and citizens .	-4.8901
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking back on the Wacker with pride .	-3.8153
" We do the city life , " he is secure through the construction office and his staff .	-4.1556
In the future , however , there are diverse projects on the agenda : the reorganisation of the former Hukla area and the Lower Court Park , for example , has been initiated .	-6.2524
The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , even the stadium renovation is still a topic .	-3.5082
The latter alone will book around 1.5 million euros , " if we get it right " , Wacker estimates .	-3.8352
" All in all great tasks are waiting for my successor .	-1.5737
'The work here is fun . '	-6.4233
The room was small but clean .	-4.8590
With Haslach ’ s own building yard and gardenery , many can be very flexible .	-4.7827
" Much can be moved , " Wacker said , and the design of green facilities is often commendably mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-4.1459
As the Old Town as an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to have " an eye to what is reinvented " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing town master stresses .	-5.2619
Without that the town mayor bears a high responsibility .	-4.0327
He is a developer , " in the end everything runs around my table here " .	-3.9833
When it comes to care and coordination , he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neumaier ( construction ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( underground building ) for 15 years .	-5.4150
Wacker also hopes that his successor will last for a long time : " We are looking for someone who wants to identify and stay with the place " .	-5.1586
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-3.4204
If you wish to inherit Roland Wacker , you should be able to study as a diplomatic engineer or a bachelor with a specialist structure and have good expertise in the fields of building and construction planning .	-7.8920
The Municipal Office is subject to high and low construction , construction planning , basic employment affairs , management of urban properties , town farm with buildings and city gardens as well as sub-construction rights authority including monuments protection .	-8.6607
Cycling on tracks : Südbahn Road closed .	-4.1890
According to the police , the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the Leoben Street ( B116 ) railway track .	-5.0677
These were damaged so much that the approaching suit had to be stopped .	-4.4314
The investigators are from two male perpetrators and are searching for them since night hours .	-3.6790
Close to the scene was observed by witnesses a pink scooter and a bicycle driver .	-4.1397
" This goes far beyond a lausse-break , " said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to APA .	-9.0403
The or the perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and also endangered rail transport .	-4.0467
In addition to the damage at the lock and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement transport , the rail customers could also receive the perpetrators ’ pictures .	-6.8862
Overall , the speaker said that we should go out of a ' substantial ' amount .	-3.3461
The damage was remedied on Friday afternoon , and rail transport on the southern route could be done without any disability .	-5.3480
Nearly ten trains were allocated on Friday morning , two of them concerning television .	-3.9608
Goods were not covered , but they were delayed .	-11.5576
According to ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch , about 200 meters of upper lines had to be exchanged .	-2.6516
Also insulators and masts were damaged .	-2.4202
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate may help relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-2.5346
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestion system .	-1.2054
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate patients ’ symptoms with inflammatory diseases .	-3.0201
The intolerable state , which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in Britain , causes stomach and leaves , recurring or bloody divergences , weight loss , and extreme authority .	-6.3471
Whereas those affected are usually expected to avoid meat and milk products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan of proteins helps develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal intestinal .	-4.4805
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , declared that immune cells in the Darm patrol to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not enter the body .	-4.0772
Cells that can cause inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissue .	-3.2583
If the equilibrium tends to go too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory dis.	-4.1694
Experiments have found that a kind of tolerance promoting immune cells occur in mice that carry a specific bacterium in their inhabitants .	-4.0935
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of proteins ’ building blocks - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-3.0823
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacteria type - Lacobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-4.1849
The more Tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-2.3273
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in Tryptophan promotes tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal , if the same system also works in humans .	-4.1739
The postdoctorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes Barragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of student mouse had such cells , but another group of the same tribe that was housed separately had this .	-5.1963
She suspected that the difference between the intestinal mice robiomes - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.6889
The dairies of the mice were sequenced by DNA and six bacteria were found , which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them absent from the mice .	-5.5736
Mushes were brought up in a sterile environment , leaving them lacking a Darmmicrobiom and not developed this type of immune cells , and they were reuteri and immune cells .	-6.3950
To understand how bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to unmature immune cells isolated from the mice .	-4.1564
Immune cells evolved into tolerance promotion cells .	-2.1329
When the active component was cleaned from the liquid , it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism known as an indol-3 milk acid . , , to . , , , , , , , ,	-9.6141
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophan in the mice feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the tryptoph values were halved , the number of cells dropped by half .	-4.1604
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance promotion cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect our gastrointestinal tracts .	-3.5801
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found among people with inflammatory narrative .	-4.7472
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.3958
Potentially high Tryptoph values can lead to an extension of this population in the presence of L. reuteri . '	-5.6068
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic committed a " genius " to a " genius " .	-2.1525
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " with Nemanja , Jose Mourinho believes , after the midfield player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-4.2366
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began on Tuesday with a 2-1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira pushed forward .	-18.2466
However , Matic was excluded from the preparatory tour of the blues and only managed 45 minutes , which admitted to Mourinho that he had to improve before the premier League season began .	-4.5862
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football " , said Mourinho .	-1.3621
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.0904
Besides Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku launched at Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season .	-3.8872
The Independent this week revealed that Mourinho wanted three more new obligations , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic work " to meet three of its four major new obligations .	-4.8940
" Three of four to have , I thank the association " , he added .	-1.8112
" I will be happier if they receive for me four of four , but they have made a great effort . "	-5.0774
Boeing " malt " Dreamliner in the sky	-1.8777
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted a dreamliner ’ s silhouette into the sky .	-2.8812
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner over the US , which are several thousand kilometres .	-4.0912
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.8330
The form of a Dreamliner was on the radar screens .	-2.9662
This was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.5367
Boeing had previously made such advertisements .	-1.7029
The number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted into the sky .	-2.5462
New low strike for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a problem .	-2.3316
As the wind turns out , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD chief , social-democratic prime ministers were always looking to Berlin with a certain concern .	-3.7523
Only no disruption from the party ’ s center , just no headwinds from the federal government - that was the most important desire of the electoral fighters .	-11.2382
Since Martin Schulz leads the party , that has changed fundamentally .	-1.1987
Since then , Willy-Brandt-Haus has been watching events in the SPD state capitals with growing horror .	-4.6063
What Schulz has received since the beginning of the year would not be described in its approach with headwinds .	-3.6409
It was depths .	-2.1453
And that is one by one .	-2.0693
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU views a general signal against SPD and Green coalitions .	-3.5380
" This once again shows : Red Green can simply not govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.9242
The surprising departure of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-4.0261
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition lost its one-vote majority in opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.4884
The Green Federal Management Director Michael Kellner has invited the dissenting Dutch Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-4.6314
The transfer to the CDU means clearly distorting the electorate .	-2.5489
Elke Twesten must immediately return its mandate , " said the Federal Manager and election campaign manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.5332
" That must not be true " , a SPD electoral campaign creates when the new Hiobsmessage reaches the party center on Friday morning .	-6.1229
Mr Stephan Weil , the SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , after the departure of Green Members , Elke Twesten , represents the CDU without a majority of government .	-4.6945
It is the temporary peak of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD National Associations .	-3.0017
And nobody knows what comes next .	-0.8107
The misery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-2.7757
A blue eye , no longer , the connoisseurs at the time cal.	-4.0678
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-1.9213
That became the case - and it all became much worse .	-4.5828

Comfortably , the enjoyments soared again in the . , . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.2080
Then when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit at Hamburg came .	-2.8708
And with him came the next deep strike .	-1.7028
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD Chief of State , lost his nimbus during that weekend because he was in Elbphilharmony while his city burnt .	-4.4225
And because , afterwards , in crisis communications , he did quite wrong what one could do wrong .	-5.2782
Since then , Scholz has fought for his political survival .	-1.2090
So Stephan Weil is now too .	-2.3575
The Dutch Prime Minister has long been in criticism because of the VW emissions affair and his role in the Supervisory Board .	-4.1472
Miese polls added .	-2.3783
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely why , over the last few weeks , it has been trying to give greater emphasis to the covenant .	-6.5206
The efforts of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin also remained unhidden in the environment of Martin Schulz .	-3.9130
They allowed him to grant him because they promised , by and large , a stabilisation of the party .	-4.1775
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-2.3334
Because , in fact , the Dutch Greens are not to blame for the party 's inter.	-5.2090

For now , therefore , the coaches are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.9418
Her anger is directed at the Greens , and here in particular at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten .	-4.1776
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests at the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miert , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary fraction , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.9017
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not for her person as a direct candidate but on the country list of the Dutch Greens , so the Dutch MEP continued .	-5.6135
The logical consequence would be to return their mandate .	-2.2336
Thomas Oppermann , the head of the SPD federal agency , complains of an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-4.0415
" The will of voters four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil a prime minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Dutch SPD as the leading candidate in the Bundestag election , the RND .	-4.3190
" Now the personal career remembrance of a future CDU member is falling the result " , Oppermann said .	-3.6704
He called for the background to be investigated .	-2.2280
I want to know whether there have been more or more promises made by the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-2.4601
Funding for Local Corners III	-3.5857
Anyone who wants to restore their house in the years can soon get support from the country .	-3.8143
In addition to informed mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG City Development on Wednesday .	-3.4543
At the beginning of the information event , advertisers once again gave a look at what has happened .	-4.5703
There are renovations since 1991 .	-2.5985
Back then , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding .	-6.9177
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the subsidy was still 60 % .	-3.0960
For athletes , the renovations so far are a " success project " - it is important to promote internal development , not only to open up new buildings .	-6.6497
On April 4 , the government Presidency Karlsruhe received information that there would be an III reconstruction area .	-3.8665
The sum of funding is 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 came from the country , the rest of the community receiving .	-4.4666
What is the result of a recovery area ?	-2.8437
They will continue to investigate where the " truly old " houses are .	-4.1345
It is also important , however , whether there is any interest in the planned area to be renovated .	-5.2519
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be postponed again .	-3.4089
On Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzsmann and Sarah Gotzel represented the STEG .	-2.7252
Keller presented the contents of the " Social City " federal Country Programme , where the renovations would be carried out .	-5.2640
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , improvement of housing and work relations and maintenance and expansion of infrastructure . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.0015
The measures would be carried out in an object , that is to say , per property .	-5.7243
The recovery area would then be defined as a statute .	-3.1520
The granting period for funding has expired from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-6.0974
However , until September this year , the inventory would be carried out to fill out a questionnaire .	-10.4459
In November or December , the statutory decision should be made to allow the sanctions to begin next year .	-5.9156
Pietzschmann then declared that each municipality must carry out the preliminary investigations .	-4.1768
It is a question of evaluating urban grievances and of deciding when renovated and to what extent .	-4.3462
It will then be reconstructed for each property .	-4.8935
Pietzschmann would come to receive himself and make an image of the situation , promised her .	-4.6064
Gotzel stressed that one of the key factors of success for the project was the participation of the .	-4.0849
There will therefore be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks , post to be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-5.3590
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land arch " , which concerns , among other things , the building state and the recovery intentions .	-5.1242
In the grey questionnaire , the " housing and housing Arc " , information on the size , division and inhabitants of a living room can be provided .	-5.2915
The blue " operating signatures " must only be filled when operated in the building .	-4.6940
However , it should be noted , as Gotzel pointed out , that a filled questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding .	-3.9445
Moreover , new building measures are not eligible for support .	-3.1933
Shindlers also stressed that the distribution of funding under the " greenhouse principle " works - who comes first - first warns .	-7.0831
You cannot " reserve " any promotional money for later use .	-4.3186
Finally , photos of the project " Loctkern II " have been shown to make a " tasteful " of the present .	-6.6258
British inventors set themselves a microchip to get into home and car with a hand movement .	-3.4109
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open its doors , enter its office , and even start its car with a hand movement .	-3.7044
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and fingers , and now offers service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company BioTeq .	-4.9160
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultant anaesthetic at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , in order to ensure that the implant procedure is implemented according to medical standards .	-4.3304
The technology resembles a cat and dog implant microchip , lasting only 30 seconds .	-2.1022
The company of Mr Northam wants to change the castles to houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of <unk> 300 per castle .	-3.6910
The married father of one has now installed technology both at home and at his BMW Z4 , which starts when his hand is on the control .	-4.2886
The White House 's advertising costs the taxpayers thousands of thousands of thousands of thousands of people . .	-6.2362
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval aircraft to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s information left to the TIME magazine .	-4.6351
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on July 17 in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.5533
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence and senior white House officials made a round round by products from all 50 countries .	-3.2079
The Connecticut helicopter was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin fire-fighter car , and a forklift from Mississippi .	-4.2461
The White House ’ s military office requested the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , after the record of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-3.8438
" I just wanted you to be aware of this , because it is such an unusual event with great visibility , " the commander of the HMX-1 wrote his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation on the eve of the event .	-3.9664
The message showed that the helicopter met for the event at 15 p.m. on 17 July , at the South Lawn , and until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-12.7942
The note adds that , if the flight was delayed from the White House , a second team would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours .	-4.8303
The original crew was on the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel remained on the plane during the time .	-3.6200
The records provided by TIME did not show clearly whether a second crew was required .	-3.7576
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.6645
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-2.9536
" One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-2.9182
As if you are locked , the Deputy Commander responded .	-7.6102
The event " Made in America " was referred to as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by Hatch Act .	-7.2137
But official events also have political overtones .	-2.2790
At the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he prompted efforts to curb the rules of government .	-4.9638
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.4055
Presidents are obliged to use them for travel .	-1.6961
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.6935
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the presidential plane performed against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , Taxi Services , and his Twitter Account is full of reports complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-3.9945
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made in America " - which shows products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-4.0795
HMX-1 cabins frequently carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to abolish US presidents in the White House with precise quantities .	-5.5044
When Trump was in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , HMX-1 carried out 58 training landings in the White House .	-3.2615
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training need for the flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.8256
Helicopter units also fled 11 hours a day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-3.2954
The White House said that taxpayers took over the burden of none of the other requests presented at the event .	-2.8609
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.1916
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for the presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-3.0718
According to hourly US Department of Defense for the 2017 fiscal year , the VH-3D refund rate is nevertheless $ 24,380 per hour . .	-9.3105
Records of the unit recorded the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.4777
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .	-1.7804
" Setting the cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for reimbursement is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.0480
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds ' .	-2.9749
According to a RAND study dating from 2015 , the DoD refund rates do not cover the cost of personnel , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract . . , and , . , , , ,	-8.8729
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.6292
" The idea is to present things that are produced in America this week , " Spicer said .	-2.3858
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it .	-2.6763
I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.3875
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise that . '	-2.2552
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his round of the South Lawn for the event , but he was in the driving seat of a fire driver .	-4.0375
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky , and cooked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-6.4270
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them ' .	-1.8168
Before TC BW Neuss	-2.5182
The top runner of the second tennis bundle league starts at the table end-of-the Suchdorfer SV .	-5.1660
The TC Blu-Weiss Neuss will take place tomorrow from 11 a.m. in Kiel at the Suchdorfer SV table end .	-4.7384
Despite five matches , the top runner of the Second Tennis Bundesliga has remained a sense of reality .	-4.9355
In any case , Teamchef Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-2.1348
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formations .	-2.5204
Especially at the rear positions I find the team very good . '	-2.6930
Suchdorf SV imports from the High North are of particular importance for class and stability .	-4.2981
" Their Danes and Finns can even refer to Davis Cup operations .	-2.7618
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.8966
" It always becomes hard for us .	-2.3926
You also need a good portion of luck . '	-2.8055
The new team for the trip to the high north is practical .	-6.3494
His debut for blue white could give Maxime Janfour .	-2.1234
If the French currently active in the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not manage to join the Bundesliga Partie , the Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Liberec ) , which is the tournament in the Czech Liberec , will be the first to be involved in this season .	-7.6744
The Chilean Hans Podlipnik Castillo , unbeaten so far , was still at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel on the ball yesterday with the Andrei Vasilevski white .	-6.0230
But he should be in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zandschulp , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and Belgian Julien Cagna .	-3.6120
After his two wins last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkusz could also return to the team .	-3.4471
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary , who was still number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016 , someone from the coach around Marius Zay is filling the cable .	-5.3665
How America Damage OMV	-1.4067
Donald Trump was really unhappy when he signed his signature on Wednesday evening with the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.3240
" In his haste of passing the law " , the Congress wrapped in a few " unconstitutional provisions " , he estimated .	-4.8394
The response from Moscow , too , was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels shattered against the US outbreak .	-3.8972
After all , the proposal is to punish European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.2636
Since then , concern has been investors of domestic OMV , who , together with other European companies , have cofinanced building the Russian Baltic Sea Election Nord Stream 2 .	-5.0028
The dream scenery is huge .	-3.2251
However , it is too early to assess the consequences , as is the official statement of the oil company .	-3.4230
Indeed , Donald Trump himself must lift sanctions via executive order .	-2.7088
Twelve weapons are at his disposal .	-2.1384
" The press " has looked at which the group could and which could really hurt him .	-4.7260
Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be placed at the heart of Netflix ’ s hit series .	-4.1032
Despite the second season of Narcos , which releases Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-3.0251
The three and four stages were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first to receive their first trailer and showed the latest evil light of the show .	-4.2287
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the cali-cartel .	-3.4009
Created by four powerful patents , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribes and violent actions .	-2.9702
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is their head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chep Santacruz London ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-2.8002
In the newly released trailer Pedro Pascal returns as Javier Peña , the type that invites American and Colombian law enforcement authorities to support the war against drugs .	-8.5432
Other new actors are Matias Varela , Michael Stahl-David , Matt Whelan , Miguel Angel Silvestre , Kerry Bishe and Arturo Castro .	-2.0493
The third season of Narcos will begin on 1 September .	-1.4774
Roll reversed : The city provides 46 kitchen aids .	-3.0881
The city is once again organizing the Kita lunch tastic itself .	-4.4287
With fixed contact for the children and a assignment to the team .	-2.0207
The clock is rotated back in the town 's children 's days .	-3.7498
On September 1st , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban kinderday facilities ( Kitas ) again in its own government .	-5.1871
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head of Youth Aid , this is good news : " We have all been very pleased " .	-3.6606
Cooking continues out of the house : a caterer takes up this task and supplies fresh cookies .	-5.0281
In 44 the children get a warm meal for lunch .	-3.5123
Over the past Kitajahr , 2800 children were tables each and the need continues to grow .	-6.0547
" Meanwhile , not only eat children who are maintained 45 hours a week , at lunch " , explains Pommerance .	-5.6064
" The offer also applies in 35-hour service when children remain until 2.00 " .	-3.9989
46 part-time forces have kitchen service from September 1st : they warm the dishes delivered , complement salad , raw cost and fruit , portion the meal individually , give food , remove it , wash and purify the kitchen .	-7.8157
" Employees are assigned to a kita " , says Pommerance .	-3.3445
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group institutions - determines the amount of hour .	-3.8821
" The kitchenettes now belong firmly to the kita team " , says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.2561
" Thus , they are much more involved and it is easier for small , educational concepts to be implemented " .	-4.5206
It is also a question : healthy diet and cooking lessons .	-3.6138
" Children should help to prepare food " .	-2.3161
The direct connection of the kitchen force to the team makes sense .	-2.7392
Even for children .	-2.2011
" They have a known force in the kita , a person familiar to them , and not constantly changing people " .	-2.9509
This continuity is important for children .	-1.3250
The cleaning of the kita rooms - up to now also the task of the kitchen forces - is done by special cleaning staff .	-4.0090
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has the charm it has shown as the most economical in terms of cost comparison between ownership and foreign expenses for the city .	-6.3867
And that , even though 46 part-time workers are recruited .	-3.4338
" But these hours are less than 750 people in the educational area , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-4.4219
Afghan democracy depends on women ’ s political role , says the UN	-1.7064
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , said the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan on Wednesday .	-1.9336
Nicholas Haysom , chairman of the United Nations mission , said that hundreds of women will run in the province ’ s presidential elections , and three women are candidates for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters are women .	-4.6839

Elections can only be representative and credible if women are fully participated and participated in all parts of the election process .	-2.6198
Afghan Province Council elections and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.4225
The Taliban have published threats against an electoral process that coincides with the transition of international fighting .	-3.6455
This year , the election will be handed over for the first time peacefully from a democratically elected government to the next .	-2.2611
Haysom said that a strong role for women will reinforce Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-5.7941
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women were registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .	-2.1162

Men try to rob 13-year-old girls out of the !	-3.4640
Two young men , aged 19 and 23 , have tried to deprive a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-2.9062
According to the police information , men spoke up against 13-year-olds with friends on the Kolpingstrasse at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to call the girl 's mobile .	-4.6853
The 13-year-old , however , rejected the request and continued with their friends .	-2.6021
As a result , one of the perpetrators tried to attack the mobile and neck chain of the girl , but missing .	-4.4553
Without prey the duo fled .	-1.9571
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-1.1607

GMB Board of Investment at McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.7972
A trade union wants to assure Managers of Biskuit Manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .	-3.9349
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-2.6385
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse as well as other products .	-3.9280
McVities owner Pladis said he invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-2.4748
He added that if their activities were changed , employees and trade union representatives would be " experienced first " .	-3.6110
In a letter to the company 's subsidiary , GMB Scotland McVitie 's called on ' to express concerns that funding for modernizing production lines is not being promoted ' .	-4.5946
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said , " The fact that we cannot gain any clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members deeply .	-4.1524
The generations of families have worked here and the workforce have focused strongly on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.2394
That is why , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising costs of living and chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a thriving presence of production at McVitie .	-8.8150
A Pladis spokesman said : " The film director at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , as we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-5.4532
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-3.1492
We discussed with the staff that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , we continually checked our business - and this applies to all our divisions and locations - to remain competitive .	-5.2661
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-4.2678
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility , and if our operations change at the location , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-5.1908
Has PSG Barcelona warned three years ago Neymar ?	-1.8224
The site of La Lega may regret your interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.2126
Paris Saint-Germain will not leave her persecution of Neymar after making an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did she warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record overy ?	-4.6007
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United in the last season for <unk> 89 million .	-4.1307
After finishing , Neymar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paying professional sports .	-4.1880
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan Management Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-4.5385
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG presid?	-2.3192
When Manchester City 2014 interested in signing Blaise Matuidi , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for each association that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.3794
" I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will stand in opposition to them , we will contact their players " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.4867
" We respect all clubs .	-0.9189
But if you try to sign one of our players , it will have consequences . "	-3.5973
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG match player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-8.1283
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to depart under any circumstances , and Barcelona felt the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offer for Neymar .	-8.3303

The tour driver touched the guideline .	-3.8456
The cars were subject to material damage .	-3.7740
The driver of the comfortable car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .	-3.2417

Interview : ' Domspatzen report unloads Papst Broder Georg Ratzinger '	-9.3010
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on abuse cases relieves Papst Broder Georg Ratzinger .	-3.3207
This is what author and historian Michael Hesemann says .	-1.8278
The Regensburg Domspatzen Final Report on the Abuse Candle continues to provide discussions .	-4.9208
Christian Weisnder , speaker of the reform movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German Press Agency , he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emperated Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.8575
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deepest regret at their own omissions , or at that time the incorrect assessment of the processes .	-5.5327
The Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised the fact that double standards are measured when reporting violence on domestic compounds .	-4.8048
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that these are ' shameful and humiliating acts ' that must be punished and prevented in the future ; but the degree of media manipulation , ' says Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national bioethics committee .	-5.8175
" The residence of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , " Scaraffia writes .	-4.2790
In the interview with the Bavarian Broadcasting Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said : " You like to ride on the church and this is a fantastic meal " .	-5.3673
She also pointed out that in her youth " shots were a very normal educational means " to get ready with the fresh children , as I was , " .	-5.7856
They would be unfair to apply today 's standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.5784
In connection with the reports on abuse cases , Georg Ratzinger has often appeared as Pope Brothers .	-8.9269
Author and historian Michael Hesemann wrote " My brother of the Pope " ( translated in 12 languages ) with Ratzinger .	-8.1558
" I have to defend Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he values the results of the final report .	-3.2967
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , commissioned by Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-3.1176
A total of 547 Regensburger Domspatzen were exploited between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990 's " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 dom-spatzes were sexually ab.	-5.1275
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked from 1964 to 1994 in Regensburg : " To summarise , it can be said that , in many cases , Domkapellmeister R. was used by physical and mental violence .	-4.8105
The punishment of punishments for pupils was precisely with high emotionality .	-4.9879
Nonetheless , unlike many other suspects , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. R. and therefore , in many cases , even despite violence , even combine positive memories with him " .	-5.7571
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger discharge .	-4.0593
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence exercise in protective predators at the Regensburg Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.0214
First , many students stress his " humanity " .	-2.1762
On the other hand , he appears also as a cholesterol and perfectionist , who was often hand-made when a domspatz did not have top performance .	-7.2699
As his biographer , how do you value this final report ?	-2.5358
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask why the name Georg Ratzinger is there .	-5.1119
He is devoted just eight pages and is clearly released from any suspicion of the cleansing or co-surgery in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.6394
Violent texts at the preschool occurred outside his sphere of activity .	-3.8453
He may be accused of learning this too late , or of not taking initial suggestions seriously enough .	-4.0311
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all the interviewers as " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-4.4278
Thus the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " rightly " , " competent " and " understandable " , as an extremely good teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , kes and bonbons and was " always converted by grapes of children " .	-6.6806
Only a minority complains about his perfectivity and his high emotionality , which once again resulted in spiritual breaks .	-5.4778
The fact that he went to the ground not only with chairs and the key confession was thrown , but also ear cows distributed and all too cheerful boys to the hair or ears , he admitted himself years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for it .	-9.1713
However , to his saving of honour , such educational methods were widespread in the time in question , the 1960s and 1970s , with parents and teachers alike .	-5.1630
Do you also know about such breeding methods ?	-2.4592
Of course , I think everyone born before 1968 .	-1.9865
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-2.7489
Compared to what this report actually deals with , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the preventive texts of violence , these are , of course , bagatelles .	-4.9971
One wonders whether it is not more popular with him and his role as a brother of Benedict XVI that many media plunged into him .	-6.0789
The Bavarian Pope is still working with many who have never understood him .	-2.8160
The truth is , however , that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in all respects !	-2.2301
Much has been said in the media in connection with the report on the subject of abuse of the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-4.1470
Will Georg Ratzinger be charged with any involvement or compassion in the final report on sexual abuse ?	-4.1425
Michael Hesemann : No .	-1.7790
None of the 67 victims of sexual attacks are claiming to have entrusted themselves to the Cathedral Chapel .	-3.7406
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-0.6568
" I never dared to talk to my father or my mother about it , " said a person in representation for the others , " I was all very embarrassing " .	-4.6027
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims were silent from shame .	-3.3361
If they did not even entrust parents and siblings , then it is certainly not a choir who would have been a perpetrator for a job .	-5.8749
How did the Dom-Spatzen students assess the role of Ratzinger in the abuses ?	-6.1094
Michael Hesemann : An interviewed student put it as " Concerning sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had had a timely insight and could have stopped the perpetrators .	-5.1827
I also think it is quite absurd to assume that he has ... Bubs have opened more urgent or clearer , or even more clearly , than against their parents , boarding boarding directors , trust instructors etc .	-7.5814
That one speaks with him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.5035
So the report comes to the very clear conclusion that ' that he was entrusted to the students and / or their surroundings in advance was not confirmed in the framework of the investigation ' .	-6.5583
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free from any co-operation .	-4.0507
So he cannot be accused of not preventing or displaying him .	-3.5497
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these unfortunate crimes , as happened unfortunately in some cases .	-3.2064
There was much to read in the media about " coincidence " at the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-4.2418
The former Cathedral Chapel Georg Ratzinger is accused of " wagging " in the report .	-4.1022
So must he live with this accusation ?	-1.9067
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that the report mixes everything and mixes it into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence texts , and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger .	-4.8433
Yet this , in turn , is an abuse of the report .	-2.3586
The fact is that there is cleaner separation : between pre-school and the gymnasium of dominance , between sexual abuse and violence texts and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.0318
In addition , the report deals with incidents of the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the chior-conductor of the Cathedral .	-5.1927
All the terrible testing pedagogy , the cases in which bodies from Sadist teachers were regularly harassed and painted and suffered appallingly , all took place at the preschool school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions have to be prevented .	-6.3222
But with whom Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with , for he got the young to face only when they were already on the Domspatzengym.	-4.8095
On that , as most witnesses stress , the theme " schooling " was tabu .	-3.8364
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-2.6490
What was different about the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-3.4722
Michael Hesemann : Although discipline dominated , it was not Sadistic violence .	-3.4300
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. R. and therefore , in many cases , even despite violence , combine positive memories with him ' .	-5.6024
For the most part , the accusation of having looked aside .	-4.8745
However , despite all the efforts , the report has only been able to define two periods in which it was reported by pre-school states .	-4.7384
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he just began to establish himself , and did not want to hear anything from what he had just worked and was responsible for , ( that is the witness ) , and then around 1993 .	-7.6534
Do Georg Ratzinger consistently listen to conditions ?	-4.3591
Michael Hesemann : No , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium , who the report actually reproduces .	-3.3597
He pointed out to him that ' the pre-school punishment will continue to be punished ' .	-4.8728
He has recommended urgent action , given the risk of negative press releases .	-2.8689
That was , of course , a long time when legal clarity existed , even in Bavaria , that was prohibited .	-7.6369
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone of us knows .	-3.6919
It was also difficult for him to assess where the parties were perhaps excessive or dramatized and where the permitted limit had actually been exceeded .	-4.9844
But one cannot say that he has always looked away .	-3.5461
That is simply not true .	-0.6527
It was only in 1980 that the caning sentence at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-4.5989
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to what was then .	-3.8230
How do you see that ?	-0.9717
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " trap of anachronism " , i.e. the danger of judging the past by moral standards .	-4.2147
The Prince is right about that .	-1.6479
But that does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which has always been horrible , nor to what has been curbed by the pre-school of resistance and violence against innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond the customary .	-7.5481
That is all quite terrible , and I am glad that it is finally being reviewed .	-6.7243
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.1546
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say ear figs and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.0125
When physical punishment was then banned , he strictly adhered to it .	-3.1657
What picture of his Regensburger time has Georg Ratzinger played out in discussions with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.0767
Is the subject of caning punishment also considered ?	-3.1035
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book deals with the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedicts XVI , from his perspective , as the domspats played only a side role .	-4.7080
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he led a rigorous regime there .	-4.6892
But this also needs to be said : Without this perfectionism , without the imperative discipline , it would not have been possible for him to formulate a world-class institution of the nationally known Regensburger Domspatzen until then , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-7.9791
With biscuits and bonbonbons alone , one doesn ’ t make a big singer and stand before any success in any area , but always discipline , passion and self-resolution .	-7.7953
What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger when talking to her book ?	-2.3650
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have really met Georg Ratzinger very well and over and over again experienced him as a wonderful , humorous , grandfaithful , deep believers , and heartfelt people , from whom one cannot imagine that he could suffer only one fly .	-8.1650
I regularly receive how many former domestic treasures still today , 23 years after his emotion , regularly keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of his family .	-5.4994
Those who do not yet forgive him that he was once rigorous with them are therefore clearly in the minority .	-4.1401
Most dom-spots are grateful to him today for enriching his life and bringing the world of music closer to them .	-4.3546
And that he was always a good , fatherful teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a loving pronounced of respect to which they are still looking and reverting them straight away .	-7.3121
And please , once again , quite plainly : everything one accuses him of is education methods that were on the agenda at that time .	-5.4922
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-1.5388
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat .	-2.9718
All too obvious is the evil intention behind it .	-2.6289
The report that has just been published disburses it .	-2.5533
Now the decency would call for a 93-year-old man who acquired great merit without the people outside Bavaria and perhaps Germany who would not know the Regensburger Domspatzen to finally make peace .	-7.6791
