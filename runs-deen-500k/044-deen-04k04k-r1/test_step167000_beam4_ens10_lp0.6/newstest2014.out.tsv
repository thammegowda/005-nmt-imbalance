Guone : More safety for pedestrians	-3.4424
The new B 33 pedestrian lamp was launched in Gutach on Tuesday at the village car park - in the view of the older town hall ampel .	-6.1586
Two facilities close to each other : Willingness or citizenship ?	-3.4918
Gutach ’ s mayor answered that question clearly yesterday .	-2.2379
" The Town Hall Ampel was installed at that time because it safeguards school path " , explained Eckert yesterday .	-4.5598
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain residents .	-3.4001
The plant which was officially operated yesterday is important for the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-2.7522
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus station , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.1804
" The high volume of traffic and pedestrian expenditures had to create another traffic light , " Eckert said .	-5.1075
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Land Council .	-3.0146
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles per day pass through the municipality of Gutach on B 33 , of which around 10 % are heavy goods traffic , " Arnold points out .	-5.5739
Therefore , the construction of another light is more than necessary : ' Safety here is just ahead ' , Arnold says .	-4.6739
All in all , four traffic checks were carried out , and a roundabout was also suspected because of the tight in the crossing area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-6.8735
According to Arnold , everything was tested in the location of the traffic light masts previously : " By means of an extra charge for us with particularly long timber trains , we have tested whether these vehicles can be exhausted from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without turning the traffic lights " .	-8.0279
The approximately EUR 15 000 traffic light plant itself is the " most modern in the current market " , explained arnold .	-5.5637
The complex is equipped with colourful LEDs that are so strong that motorists like drivers can see the lights well in the low sun .	-6.9186
And thrifty it is also : The older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-4.2937
There are three light plants per journey .	-2.6238
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .	-8.0963
When the pedestrian hits the traffic light button , the top radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-3.2888
If the road is free , green comes immediately for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.1491
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase may be closed for the pedestrian .	-2.5661
" If a group or handicapped people go through the streets , the Green phase is extended , so everyone is sure about the track , " explained Arnold .	-5.4271
Of course the drivers should think about it as partners and watch the bicycle .	-4.6285
This was not the case yesterday : few people showed the light for pedestrians green , a top class vehicle routed through - with luminous red .	-5.7154
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the need of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-2.3220
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - voicelessness , hitch to raw violence and stubborn sexuality , narrow and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet .	-6.4775
The prize winner is known primarily as a prose author , theatre texts are in his work rar .	-4.5077
Collage from prose texts Gerhard Fresacher assembles a collage of prose texts for his performance " weather lights on the tongue tip " , which is in Gat Pe.	-6.0296
The theatre maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographic novel " Der Leibeigen " ( 1987 ) with prosaminatures from " Leichnam , his family stirring " ( 2003 ) .	-5.1091
On the largely empty stage - important requests : a crushed sofa where copulated and masturbated is copied and masturbated - the eight-person ensemble goes through the text material .	-6.4766
But director Fresacher does not seem to have much faith in the text .	-3.6523
The 70-minute performance outlines the template with a wealth of regional inputs , known from the repertoire of postdramatic game forms .	-4.5558
Especially the actors come out of the sometimes rather questionable Scenic translations .	-4.7900
They are touched hard with the head squeezed under water , with their evening drops taken to the wall .	-5.3302
Impressed in cellophane or middle , they stack on dangerously high slopes through the staging , either monologize loudly or are totally silenced on the stage floor .	-6.2214
The text is , however , hardly prescribed in that way .	-3.7602
The best moments are spent the evening , when the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-4.8364
It is only by the end that the overwhelmed performance brings something to the calm , and angular clothing with absurd humour .	-8.0291
A blackbox in the car ?	-1.4824
American road planners are looking for a money source to repair the declining Highway system , and believe the solution has been found in a small black box that can be found in the dashboard of every car .	-5.8459
The devices that record every kilometre driven and report information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning agencies of the states to revise the obsolete system of financing US roads .	-4.4988
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly launched an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-3.0883
Libertarians have allied to environmental groups and are in favour of the government being able to use small boxes to record the kilometres that have been dropped – and possibly where they have been driven – and then to use the information to calculate tax models .	-6.6004
The Tea Party is apparent .	-1.5471
The American Citizens ' Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.3428
But , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states no longer wait .	-2.8058
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next decade to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-9.9955
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-1.7839
That really is a must for our country .	-1.4340
“ It ’ s nothing we can only use , ” says Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assen of Governments , which plans a record of the fed miles on all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .	-5.6338
The way in which we pay these taxes will change . to to .	-9.9509
There is technology for that .	-1.7759
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from the taxes that US Americans pay in the tap column , has failed .	-3.9808
But in America no longer as much gets done as before .	-3.7359
Cars use fewer petrol .	-1.4398
The national mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 Eurocent per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.7963
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even for a single cent at high peak prices .	-3.0149
“ The petrol tax is simply not feasible for the future , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-2.9292
Recently , his state has equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a milestone payment system .	-2.8188
“ This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-2.3140
It is a milestone user fee .	-2.5158
It is not surprising that the idea is found with urban Liberal liberals , for example , because the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced .	-5.1291
The Californian planners rely on the system to draw up strategies aimed at achieving the ambitious , statutory objectives of the state on climate change .	-4.4263
But Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also declared that he views it as the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.1751
The freelancers of the Reason Foundation are also invited to pay drivers back .	-4.1877
“ This is no tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Reason Directives .	-2.3952
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.1248
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers , who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward milestone settlements .	-3.2960
Last year , the US Senate approved a 90 million dollars of expensive pilot project , which would cover 10,000 cars .	-3.1431
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of members from rural areas who represent people who , in everyday life , often have to put many miles on the road to work or to the city .	-5.6026
Several states and major cities are nevertheless moving in this direction .	-2.1943
The most committed is Oregon , which currently purchases 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-3.7891
These drivers will soon pay the mileage charges instead of the oil tax on the federal state .	-3.1629
Nevada has completed its pilot project .	-8.8844
New York City also considers that .	-1.2028
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with lorries .	-1.9250
And the I-95 coalition , which includes 17 states ’ transport ministries on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is studying how to introduce the change .	-3.3696
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.9853
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were skeptical about thinking that the government could follow any of their movements .	-3.3469
“ Concerns to Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” Alauddin Khan explains , head of strategy and results management in the Nevada Transport Department .	-4.5480
People did not want it .	-0.9747
When the test began , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website , “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into adult surveillance equipment . ”	-4.2981
There is no need to build a massive technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-3.2441
Nevada belongs to a number of states that now look to affordable technology , with which the state can capture the kilometres driven , but not precisely when and where .	-4.6591
That , Khan said , would also reassure the public .	-5.1621
The hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.7116
The company originally did not start to help states tax drivers .	-4.0259
Instead , it was their aim to foot in an emerging market for vehicle insurance , where drivers are supposed to pay on the basis of the miles that have gone .	-6.1077
But their tested devices are also interesting to road planners , because they do not work with GPS and deliver limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem .	-4.3360
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , CEO of True Mileage .	-2.5643
Much mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programmes .	-6.7017
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing so .	-8.6096
In Oregon , planners experiment in giving drivers a number of options .	-2.8816
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.7250
Or they do not elect any equipment at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state .	-5.2298
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping devices with more functions than with a few .	-3.7711
In New York City , traffic officials intend to develop a taxation device that also allows parking charges to be paid , insurance must be paid only for the kilometres dropped and speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic .	-6.7473
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” said in a planning document in the city .	-2.9224
However , some transport planners are wondering whether the whole talk about payments per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-4.1136
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay , officials declared that Congress can solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax .	-2.7776
An additional one-off fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol so that they also pay a fair share .	-4.0505
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” says Randy Rentschler , the head of legislation and public affairs of the Commission .	-3.7335
If we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers get their privacy and many other things .	-2.8800
Königsfeld : Small team beats a watcher .	-2.9000
The voluntary fire brigade managed its autumn audience despite a lack of human resources with Bravour .	-5.5316
Only eleven men participated in the exercise .	-1.8018
Department commander Hans Kammerer selected the property in Burgberger Straße in his exercise .	-3.7585
The saw was supposed to be a short distance there .	-4.2063
Two people were injured by the emerging fire and smoking development , but one could still send an emergency call .	-2.8502
Following the first review of the facts by Hans Kammerer , two guards of the army decided to enter the building .	-5.2786
After a short period of time , the first person was able to find and guide the free .	-4.3203
The second person had to be worn .	-0.6840
It was a bit noisy at night .	-5.2607
The building , a workshop with an integrated stall for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.9179
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it . . and . ! , , , , the , , , , , , , ,	-7.9036
Furthermore there were electric machines for wood processing .	-2.1587
The first decision was taken by the tank in the vehicle .	-7.6093
Another direction was taken by an overflow hydrant in about 100 meters distance .	-4.1050
Three solution solutions have now been designed .	-2.8387
A hollow tube was used in the building as well .	-3.7749
Hans Kammerer was also instructed to show what to be done with little staff available .	-4.6656
In the worst cases , support is provided via the Königsfeld day-intervention group .	-4.4564
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .	-2.4650
Network of universities and companies important	-2.1804
During his visit to the county of Breisgau High Schwarzwald , the country President Guido Wolf also explained where the workforce of tomorrow came from in Titisee-New .	-6.3386
In the Hochschwarzentrum Hochschwarzald , he went to the CEO of vocational schools , the district gymnasium and the chairman of parents on this important issue .	-7.3999
" Education is an important factor " , stressed Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project High Schwarzford education centre .	-10.8619
Wolf was impressed by the educational model projects .	-2.7661
Since 2011 , there has been successful cooperation in the forest town between the Federal Centre , the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre .	-5.2477
He also praised family friendliness in the county .	-4.6158
" It is important not only to take a look at the family phase , but also , as a result of demographic change , to maintain the care of relatives , " Wolf said .	-4.7547
He also led to more and more employees taking care of the care and care of their relatives .	-4.1897
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees could lead to an end to the employment relationship , " Wolf said .	-9.9840
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers , he continued to say .	-3.1129
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-2.8313
" For anyone who has already experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and skills , often maintains the regional economy , which helps to strengthen the region , " is convinced of the country 's president .	-6.8712
Only if enough training places were offered could the skilled workforce be met .	-4.1710
In his opinion , the local advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-2.8211
He also experienced the efforts already undertaken to expand public transport at Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg on his train journey .	-5.4814
" Stay stubbornly and make public transport better , " he said to the local politicians present .	-3.5257
Music experience an entertaining afternoon .	-2.1447
The Kaul family has already been inviting the Dieting seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vessel for 15 years .	-3.8659
Previously , older citizens were inhabited in the resting site .	-5.5185
This afternoon will take place in the nursery of St. Josef .	-3.9451
The residents are looking forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.3806
Later , we saw a sausage .	-2.9374
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with regular melodies .	-4.9183
The more than 100-year-old nature stone wall , which is at the forefront of the old school court on the Kirchstraße , which was held before the reconstruction , is to be replaced with the reconstruction costs of the city of Bräunlingen .	-7.7480
In the days before the kilogram , a small angle wall was installed during the first work of the reconstruction of the front school court , for the stabilization and static discharge of the more than a hundred years old natural stone wall with balust. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and .	-9.3211
Other measures , such as Alexander Misok , from the Bräundlinger Town Office , include the National Monument Malt in the plans and create a reconstruction concept for the old wall .	-7.1557
A cost-calculation will then be carried out by experts , who will then be put on the table to the Council of Ministers to decide and decide on how to proceed further .	-7.1179
A decision on this will likely fall next year .	-2.4696
Following the refurbishment , pavement and tree planting of the old school inside the two sides wings of the school built in 1912 , in the foreseeable future the need for the restoration wall must be refurbished and placed on new substructure .	-8.2071
The historical , one-hundred years old demarcation wall of the ancient Schulhof to the Kirchstraße , is mostly due to water and frost damage , as no drainage is available , needs renovation and has an archery leap forward .	-7.3130
Deep cracks in stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is currently not collapsing .	-3.9732
A standardised wall is a prerequisite for a school court used by students , which has been done by the current forti.	-5.1149
Originally , the schoolhof renovation was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure was postponed .	-4.3466
An important word in the historical school wall renovation , which has already been used for film pictures , will be the National Heritage List .	-9.4548
If you have any guidelines on this site , then the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monuments .	-5.8834
The students of the Bräninger primary school who are now being taught again in a well-refurbished old school building with new Aula can soon use the old school court .	-6.1184
Özdemir intends to receive jazz training in Stuttgart .	-2.7655
Cem Özdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has also been active in the ongoing discussions on the future of the high school in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.7134
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic education at the Stuttgart Music University " , said Özdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.6934
Jazz and classic are just in front of the jazz site Stuttgart .	-3.4501
That contradicts Özdemir , who is the favourite for a direct mandate for the German parliamentary election on September 22 , the Green Red State Government .	-7.5587
Baden-Württemberg ’ s five music colleges are reorganizing on the basis of an expert study .	-5.1638
Then , among other things , the University of Jazz and Pop is to be moved from the Stuttgart Music University to Mannheim .	-4.9342
US border : " Super-tunnel " discovered to smuggle drugs .	-2.5952
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and shut down a " super tunnel " to drug smuggling .	-3.1652
As the US customs authorities indicated , the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway lines , and ventilation system .	-4.8270
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of Marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized .	-2.5899
According to the data , the tunnel was not used yet .	-2.8899
" This cartels are stupid when they think they could go through under the radar , " said the general prosecutor of the US district Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in San Diego , where the tunnel was discovered .	-4.5203
Duffy said to the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.5091
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a long-term battle against the drug cartels .	-1.9483
Since 2006 , more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-1.9482
Designed by experts	-1.8297
Due to the expensive tunnel equipment , the investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took up about a year .	-4.3219
The rail system was so equipped that electrically powered cars were used there .	-4.2756
On the Mexican side there is access to a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-3.2239
According to authorities , a head of 20 meters leads to the depth of the tunnel itself .	-3.1838
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres height and 90 centimeters width .	-2.3167
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-2.6078
Two suspects were arrested in connection with the Cocaine Fund .	-1.8374
The third , a Mexican , was captured because of the seized Marijuana .	-3.1776
As officials have said , there is a threat of lifelong withdrawal of freedom for on . .	-7.1651
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and the San Diego press conference continued to be held .	-6.3449
It is , however , the first time that a tunnel building cocaine has been found .	-3.3158
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not tunnels .	-2.2295
This shows the " despair " of drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , Bill Sherman said about DEA drugs in San Diego .	-3.8012
They would do everything to reach the US .	-1.9164
The detainees were not given any details , at least one of them was Mexicans .	-3.0112
They have to face sentences of up to ten years .	-2.2707
2014 Geisinger Festival	-7.3557
The anniversary of the City of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.2663
Resurrection of the first speech is getting closer and closer .	-3.7279
When the year ends in about eight weeks , the year will be the year for the year .	-4.0332
Hosts and church houses were first mentioned together in a romantic manner .	-11.5661
In churches a certificate was produced which mentions both places .	-3.4214
On 15 March there is to be an official launch for the anniversary , and as hostages currently have no hall , this event is taking place in the place where , for the first time , 1250 years ago , both of them were mentioned in church houses . are , . , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.0815
A number of events are planned during the anniversary in both hostages and church homes .	-3.6260
The church house will be 1250 in July on a weekend from July 18 to 20 July .	-3.7476
Again , celebrate .	-1.5667
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the Kirchtalhalle .	-2.8042
On this festive weekend there is also the church house festival .	-3.2264
City musician Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is listed on three dates .	-4.3192
On June 21 , together with the Sunwendfeier of the Black Forest Association , July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 , the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-4.7073
This will be completed and inaugurated in the year of anniversary , the official date is on the last September weekend , 27 and 28 September .	-4.9105
A new chronic is brought out on the occasion of the hostage anniversary .	-3.5438
" But a chronic should not only be made by the hostages themselves , but rather a printed work about the hostage of today , which is made up of hostages , church houses , bodies , eyebrows and godfalls , " said Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-8.0705
And the hostage of today celebrates 2014 birthday , in 1974 today 's space was completed with the incidents .	-4.7542
The new chronic will be presented at the new Festival Hall in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-2.9474
In 2014 , however , it is another year with many Jubilee .	-4.2020
The Narrenzung Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a custom bend on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years old and will celebrate the festival banquet on 29 March and the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-6.3145
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been in the new location for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the Musikverein Polymnia Leipferdingen will celebrate 150 years of age and this is celebrated within the fountain festival of 4 to 7 July .	-5.7040
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a certificate owned by St. Gallen monastery in 764 .	-3.1757
The certificate was produced in churches ( house ) , which was then court place .	-3.5494
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same certificate .	-2.6034
The reason for 2014 to celebrate this 1250 year old is that , in addition , the local reform lags 40 years .	-5.6321
Council is targeting pillar installations	-3.4777
Should the train transition " Am Hirschen " be carefully rebuilt to increase road safety ?	-4.0640
Yes , the communities have decided .	-1.5695
Schilbach must take EUR 220 000 into its hands .	-3.5420
Deutsche Bahn is planning to improve the Kinzigtal Bahn route next year .	-3.0201
The safety of rail passengers is particularly intended to increase - regularly it comes to collisions of trains with other vehicles across Germany .	-5.8048
If the municipalities vote for reconstruction , they have to take part in the costs of one-third , the rest share the train and the federal government .	-5.7819
Schiltach ’ s Mayor of the City of Greece explained to the municipality the peculiarities of the train transition " Am Hirschen " .	-5.9007
There , the city plans to build an balance at the same time as the tunnel west of the railway track .	-5.6181
There , even larger vehicles , such as those transporting long-timber , could be in the vicinity without having to block the track .	-5.2654
Greeks therefore suggested constructing a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-5.1567
This was controversially discussed in the municipal councils because some advocates questioned the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , brought critics ’ mood to the point : ' Do we need so much money for so few vehicles ? '	-6.3028
Thomas Haas mayor contradicted this : The railway passage " Hirschen " is regularly used for long-hole transport .	-4.9435
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " section is transported partly over this route , because the up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route to the Häberle bridge because they could not get to the main road .	-5.8453
In addition , the route serves as a diversion for those vehicles which cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed Haas argued .	-4.5305
In the light of the fact that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels need to be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway passage " Am Hirschen " could also be an important means of transport for a longer period of time .	-6.2379
Councils agreed to investigate the cost of spreading the street .	-3.8355
In spite of this , the majority approved the restructuring of the railway transition with the measure that the necessary supporting wall is built to expand the subsequent road towards " Railway Station " , if necessary , to meet traffic at around 5.5 meters .	-8.1582
The rebuilding of the railway transition to the Trautwine area could , on the other hand , lead to a quite different problem affecting access to the greatly increasing " hospital path " .	-8.1417
The administration had studied the railway reconstruction plans from the Engineers Office , Breinlinger , because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltshäuser Weg would be possible without further delay .	-8.4165
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not excluded that the propensity of the street could lead to longer vehicles being in place .	-5.3693
In turn , the responsibility lies with the city as a road bearer .	-4.4967
The conversion could therefore create liability disputes .	-3.0514
Haas argued that both the timber replacement and the current expansion were to work as well , if the railway transition was not to be accepted .	-8.4994
Here too , the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle that is on the transition should be significantly lower than on the other railway transitions , because directly next to the center where there is a good connection to the train .	-9.0806
Even trains from the main railway station should be braked at this point , so far that no collision threaten .	-5.0766
Most of the time , the refusal to approve this transition , as the city of Schiltach would have to ' unravel the problem with seated vehicles ' , the Councils said that the railway could withdraw from the responsibility once the construction has been completed .	-8.6048
As an unproblematic consideration , the body considers the rebuilding at the railway transitions " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which intersections with the railway have already been reached .	-6.4600
Esa decides on great space missions : billions of missions	-2.3213
Far planets , gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to start over the next few years .	-3.0689
30 proposals were made for the selection , five are still in the race .	-2.3234
Far worlds .	-0.4463
Over 1000 planets on other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.3393
Whether there is at least some of them , nobody knows .	-2.4324
It ’ s hard to select : Are you looking for gravity waves ?	-3.8820
Or do you prefer to explore the origins of the cosmos ?	-2.7066
Or , after earth-like planets , to discover extraordinary life ?	-4.0398
These are the issues which are the responsibility of the Esa European Space Agency .	-2.8663
For their " Cosmic Vision " program , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make the research decisive .	-4.9595
The budget for such ' L ' missions is around EUR 1 billion .	-2.9032
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.8735
In early September , in Paris , the elite of European space research met to discuss proposals for such missions .	-1.8040
30 ideas were raised ; five of them have now come to a closer election .	-3.6072
Numerous bodies examined the proposals , hacking in with the researchers .	-5.3033
In the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific committee .	-3.0780
Overall four major questions have been chosen by the Esa to find answers to the mission of the 2007 Cosmic Vision programme .	-4.2452
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life ?	-1.5733
The exact processes of the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and thus the emergence of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness .	-4.5737
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this dark .	-2.0436
And if an asterisk planet possesses , under what circumstances can it create life ?	-3.8949
To address this issue , 2017 is to launch the " Cheops " space telescope , with which 500 planet systems already known in our closer surroundings are examined .	-6.3250
However , possibilities are limited , Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.8785
With larger instruments , astronomers could form earth-like planets , and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , seeking " biomarkers " : gases that are considered to be an indictment of biological activity .	-4.4754
How does the solar system work ?	-1.1831
This question , too , should ultimately be clarified as to what the conditions are for the creation of life .	-5.0667
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of his magnetic field as well as the particle radiation of it with the planet system .	-4.5149
Our solar system provides examples of these processes .	-2.9229
With the Solar Orbiter , the Esa has already approved a M class mission ( the budget is around EUR 1 billion ) for this issue .	-4.3342
The Song is to start in 2017 and watch the Sun 's surface and activity closely .	-3.6222
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to researchers .	-1.8528
You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in the development of the solar system .	-2.9340
The first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme is for this purpose .	-3.4578
The song " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-2.2982
Eight years later she reaches Jupiter and is supposed to study the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.7085
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.8187
The world has many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to see if the natural laws we know are still valid there .	-4.6837
There may also be deviations that could point the way for physicists to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united .	-4.3379
How did the universe arise and what consists of it ?	-2.3534
It was 13.7 billion years ago that our cosmos came from the primary hub .	-4.3150
In addition to our common subject , from stars , planets and living species like us , there are dark matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxies together , and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of the space .	-5.4557
Until now , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first quarters of the original , nor do dark matter and dark energy exist .	-4.1670
" Euclid " has already granted Esa an M mission to be launched for 2020 .	-4.9133
With a special telescope , the song should examine the distribution of material in the universe for the first time in the sky , thereby allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-5.7025
Who could do the race ?	-1.5131
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.1437
In the opinion of many experts ' e-Lisa ' , the best chances of approval as a L mission is an ambitious concept for demonstrating gravitational waves .	-5.9268
Physicists understood changes in space structures that Albert Einstein had anticipated almost 100 years ago .	-3.3586
They have not been proven to date .	-1.9805
Elisa could manage this , the scientists hope for the project .	-2.7493
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in all .	-4.2821
In contrast to plants on the plant , he could also demonstrate gravity shafts that were created at the time of the original and provide new insights into the origin of the cosmos .	-7.1580
Four other proposals compete with the second L-mission : a large X-ray elescope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore , among other things , black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planet of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which will find and study the natural planet .	-6.4010
There are already proposals for sampling back from Mars , for exploring Moon , Venus and Asteroids , as well as sun physics .	-5.1676
Snowden ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-4.2628
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has declared that he is willing to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not provide any answers about their activities .	-4.4140
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where he received his asylum to discuss his statement in Germany .	-2.8614
In a letter from Snowden presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Ströbele , it writes : “ Even though the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a faithfulness and attempts to criminalise political expression with a threat of punishment , which cannot be defended . ”	-7.1991
The truth is not a crime .	-1.6122
In the letter Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support could convince the American Government to drop the charge against him .	-3.9310
The charges imposed by the US Department of Justice include spionage and theft of state assets .	-3.0587
The German Interior Minister , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said about time online : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to speak with German representatives , then we find ways to make that possible . ”	-3.9594
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has stopped the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-3.7953
Thomas Oppermann , the honourable Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , declared that you should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as witnesses if this is possible , “ without jeopardising him and completely destroying relations with the US . ”	-5.3448
Stroke , a member of the Greens , published a picture of itself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-3.2557
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-0.9966
Ströbele said that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA member , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he left the country .	-3.7474
When Snowden stated in Germany , he would need a reassurance that he was “ safe ” there , the Member .	-7.1140
Snowden explains in his letter that he is faced with a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that has driven him from his homeland .	-4.2678
But he is touched by the global response to “ my act of political opinion . ”	-6.9552
Citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit of the general public .	-4.3500
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-2.5151
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-1.4207
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers wishing to baggage their flight .	-3.2442
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even if it was to read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-4.1137
The new charge applies to hand baggage in a baggage compartment over the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .	-3.2014
Frontier declared that if the fee is paid in advance , you will charge USD 25 , and USD 100 for passengers who only paid the flight .	-5.0386
Frontier Speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the $ 100 charge is aimed at moving travellers to pay in advance .	-3.6024
“ We don ’ t want to calculate that sum , ” she explained .	-2.4092
In 2008 , airlines began to demand charges for the first and second baggage re.	-3.5099
Passengers who tried to bypass these baggage have therefore plugged as much as possible , resulting in the fact that baggage boxes are often overcrowded over the seat .	-5.4676
Fees are one way to get passengers on board less .	-1.9556
O 'Malley said that the new charge did not really make money .	-2.7771
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the specialist seat .	-5.4160
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-2.5025
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a baggage free of charge at the flight of Frontier , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a comparable baggage . . will to . and will be to . to to to to to . to to to	-10.4864
O 'Malley declared that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed , so that passengers are informed of the fee before they come to the flight .	-10.8495
Frontier 's new hand baggage fee will only enter into force in summer , and there is no date .	-4.6408
Passengers frequently raise baggage supplements and other charges , but airlines like to return to it .	-3.1168
They argue that the transportation of luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wanted it .	-3.1715
Many of the new baggage charges on Wall Street are signalling that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-4.4866
Most of them have so far left the fingers for hand baggage charges .	-4.0307
Spirit Airlines Inc. first charges for hand baggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air was a low-cost aircraft .	-4.4537
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , stated by the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who carefully follows the additional charges .	-4.4093
In a December 2011 report , he estimated that the Spirit hand baggage fee would bring USD 50 million a year .	-3.5855
Sorensen , who had previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , was recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what would expect him to be on the flight if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual handbaggage fee .	-9.9135
“ The boarding process was one of the smooth ones I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-2.5242
I expected to see teeth ceremonies and hands-on discussions at the flight stage .	-7.6823
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding was lubricated . ”	-2.2505
Frontier follows Spirit from the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-3.3577
The company declared that passengers buying a limonade or a juice should keep the whole cane and that coffee should be replenished for free .	-5.2843
Water remains free of charge .	-0.7245
In 2008 , US Airways attempted to demand money for refreshing drinks , but returned seven months later , after passengers had complained and no other large society had reversed .	-5.2184
Frontier ’ s move to collect charges for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-5.0773
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz USD 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-3.0636
This gives all companies an incentive to get passengers to buy their passengers directly , rather than through an online travel agency .	-4.9426
Frontier has , however , gone most widely in this area .	-1.6079
In September , the company started to award only half as many frequent flight miles for bookings via an online travel agency .	-4.0720
On Wednesday , the miles were reduced to 25 percent of the route .	-2.8253
A flight travel booked by a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles is therefore only bringing customers 250 miles .	-5.1863
Passengers may also reserve their seats for direct purchases on the Frontier website .	-8.2302
Frontier has a loyal customer base at his Denver headquarters , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .	-2.9230
The revenue decreased by 9 % , and aircraft capacity contracted almost 13 % in the first quarter , as is to be read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc . .	-12.9408
Republic has tried to get Frontier 's finances under the sale of the Company under control .	-3.2707

It compared several saying words with the corresponding bible sites and explained the meaning .	-3.6225
She called proverbial words like : Wooden eyes are vigilant , as scaffolds fall from the eyes , cast an eye on someone who gives his lady in the sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-6.3354
On several occasions , the speaker told her audience what the proverb was .	-4.2232

Learning instead of unemployed : Pilot project for Unlearned in Tourism	-2.6320
At the Mecklenburg Lakes Plate , a pilot project for the tourism industry starts .	-4.4247
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 men and women who are already working as undocumented in the industry are allocated over three winters to professionals for hotels and restaurants .	-5.5021
" The six-month courses end with qualifications , " said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Working Agency .	-3.8503
The benefits are diverse : they would not be unemployed , firms would become trained professionals who lacked more and more in hotels and restaurants , and the agency should not finance unemployment .	-6.4446
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel- and Guest Office ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-3.4139
NSA declares that a “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the website .	-3.4802
The shadow National Security Agency declared on late Friday that a bug has paralysed its public website some hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-5.5754
“ NSA.gov was not available for some hours this night as an internal error occurred during a scheduled update , ” the spy agency explained in an email message .	-4.3149
The problem will be resolved this evening .	-1.2168
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) was not true .	-2.6602
In the early evening , online server trackers discovered that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours , and for some users it is still not available .	-5.1015
Before that , a NSA spokesman to ABC news stated that the sensitive internal network of the Authority was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.4296
Secret information is not at risk , according to the speaker .	-2.1238
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-1.9192
In such attacks , the target site is flooded with page calls until the server is overloaded and the site collapses .	-3.1687
The cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks are not designed to penetrate into the internal network of the target system .	-2.7006
The previously super-secret NSA , whose nickname once was No Such Agency ( no such authority ) , now finds itself in the light of the public and looks at revelations about its extensive domestic and foreign surveillance program – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA staff Edward Snowden .	-6.2748
The growing controversy over intelligence began speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyper-operation .	-4.0814
Simply reduced the number of people without job in October by 22 to 1.307 .	-3.3157
Although the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and better than in September , " we would have hoped for more " , Monika Felder Bauer says , deputy manager of the office of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen .	-5.3719
Because many companies have responded so far to attitudes .	-2.9264
One reason for this is , according to Felder Bauer : " We have hardly professionals in the craftsmanship , health and care for the elderly " .	-4.8522

Revenue losses at Bombardier after the decline in delivery numbers and orders	-4.3655
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent decline in net winning on Thursday after having been under pressure by decreasing orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway savings .	-5.7435
Bombardier , headquartered in Montreal , did not publish any flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and gave no new information about whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule of next September .	-5.1469
Only three more starts have so far followed the virgin flight of the testing aircraft one and a half months ago , making it questionable whether the test phase is scheduled .	-6.2715
The results stayed behind the forecasts , leading to a crash of more than 8 % on the Toronto stock market .	-4.0785
Cameron Doerensen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his assessment on Thursday from outperform to “ sector perform ” in view of the fact that the share has a limited spare potential in the next one to two quarters .	-5.9897
“ While weaker aircraft delivery numbers were widely expected , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerssen in a customer letter .	-4.4366
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the test program for the aircraft proceeds .	-4.1172
If , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-3.6659
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.7707
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and , after months of delay , flew for the first time in September .	-2.7927
But binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate so far as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings are accurate for the new jet aircraft .	-4.5928
Currently there are 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and companies .	-2.2496
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .	-3.0759
The management of the company also insured analysts and the media on Thursday , and the program was in the schedule .	-4.3658
“ The test aircraft no longer stayed on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that while the aircraft was running ground tests and software updates .	-4.3945
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.2511
We have decided to make a first flight and then have a revision period which we have also done .	-3.9815
This is happening throughout the entire flight programme .	-2.6313
The second of five testing aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it was from the company ’ s page .	-4.5699
However , analysts remain skeptical as to whether the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft after the flight of June twelve months .	-3.6919
Bombardier declared that it verifies the planning for start-up ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-3.6514
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to Bombardiers ’ internal planning – reinforces our view that the start-up will shift to the first quarter of 2015 , ” Doersen said .	-4.8941
In the third quarter at the end of September , Bombardier ’ s net profits fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share in the year earlier .	-4.1566
The adjusted earnings per share is 9 cents .	-2.1568
Sales were low and dropped from $ 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.7410
Analysts had expected a gain of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.3152
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that it delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-3.1413
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-2.5053
The order book in the Aerospace Chart was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September and was thus unchanged on 31 December .	-4.1800
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were disappointing as part of our specifications , but the low order intake and market conditions overall were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.6852
Sales in the aerospace chart fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.7281
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this saving have risen by nearly 11 percent to $ 2.1 billion .	-2.9589
The order book in the transport save was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September and was slightly higher than 31 December .	-4.0813
The transport profit margin has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.7656
According to company management , there will be new benchmarks for the fourth quarter .	-2.5263
In the afternoon trade on Thursday , the Bombardier share fallen by 8.5 % and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after announcement that the Google Financial Board will change Patrick Pichette to the Board .	-4.5676
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombing of the narrowest rival , reported a ten-percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday .	-4.0209

Coca-dependent lawyer , who warned drug bosses against police investigation , must be imprisoned .	-6.7525
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave further information to the underworld size of Neil Scarborough .	-3.3985
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light .	-1.8100
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.3271
A well-known prosecutor who warned a drug baron before a major police investigation because he feared that his secret drug addiction could be discovered was sentenced to three years in prison .	-4.0988
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied the underworld size of Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on the activities of drug trafficking after being compromised by his own cocaine inspection .	-4.5271
In 2011 , the Criminalist lawyer , praised as a “ first-class ” lawyer with the nickname “ Bash , ” was arrested in his house after the police had monitored Scarborough , which he had represented in an earlier drug procedure .	-6.1742
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , during which he was with colleagues at a meal of the lawyer room .	-4.5117
The investigation revealed that Ditta used class-A drugs regularly after testing traces of cocaine in his hair , its wallet and credit cards were found .	-4.1868
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.5024
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in a major investigation process for the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.0196
They were later arrested , together with 32 other people , after the police secured <unk> 1.5 million in a series of house searches , Heroin and Cocaine , and <unk> 200 000 in cash .	-5.2512
Ditta , 42 , passed information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public .	-2.7295
Today , Ditta , working for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and condemned at the Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstructing the judiciary .	-4.0846
He admitted cocaine ownership in an earlier survey .	-3.4139
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in her investigation against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-4.0357
Two investigative officers followed suspicions and saw how he went to Dittas Haus , where the drugs laid out a purity of 60 % in a black golf shoe under the lawyer 's tonne .	-5.6176
Shortly after he handed drugs , telephone Scarborough regularly with Ditta , who was in Ewood Park dinner at the Blackburn Rovers football stadium .	-3.9644
The lawyer returned home , received the drugs and then nine communications between the two were exchanged .	-3.0015
It became known before the court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after class-A tests had been discovered in his hairs , their wallet and credit cards .	-5.0576
Ditta was later arrested , but disputed to take cocaine and said that he spoke to the alleged dealer , because he was his client , claiming that her discussion was “ lawyer secret . ”	-5.0028
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were ensured and a hair sample was removed .	-3.1201
At the police interrogation he asserted that he would run an office and clients on legal matters under both his private address and at the workplace .	-5.6969
Prior to the court , it was known that he had called important drug trafficking players , some of whom he had previously represented , and had informed them of what the investigators knew about them .	-5.5456
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.5011
Ditta was accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he was too involved with certain clients .	-3.9717
The relationship in question is not just that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his lawyer .	-3.5306
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of those people .	-7.9331
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.0520
He opposed the police investigation as far as possible , so that it could continue to investigate its criminal activities .	-4.1867
Mr Ditta has thus given away his profession .	-3.8628
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.6362
Ditta dismissed and claimed that “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass information on Scarborough , I would not wait for 15 hours , but would do so immediately . ”	-4.7062
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the Lancashire police : “ Mr Ditta did the move from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals . ”	-3.9690
His cocaine independence led to a hopeless compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who mandated him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-4.5186
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public .	-2.1502
Ditta lost that confidence and tried to disappear behind the façade of his profession .	-2.9639
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to a condemnation in three cases of cocaine and judicial obstacles , underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.1188
This case should be a warning to criminals , showing that nobody can escape the law ’ s arm .	-3.2878
We find you and bring you to the court .	-2.0468
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after having declared guilty of conspiracy on heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-3.5535
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drugs .	-4.4987
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about his dream job as a lawyer in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and Equal Inequality is the motivation for his work .	-4.1424
Revolutionary work of church music	-1.3929
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary , the song " Dunningen " will frame two God services with the " Deutsche Messe " of Franz Schubert .	-5.2377
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which impressed the spectators this spring , the song 's sincerity at the end of the anniversary year will enrich two God services with the performance of Franz Schubert 's Deutsche Messe .	-5.3959
On Saturday , 26 October , this extraordinary fair will be heard at the St. Martinus Church in Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 October , from 10.15 p.m. at the God Service in the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf .	-5.3689
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Songs to the celebration of the sacred victim of the fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual musical work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of the emergence .	-4.4897
The exhibition is listed within the framework of the services of God , as the client , Johann Philipp Neumann , had in in mind . , , . , , , , , . ,	-7.5543
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the band Frohsen Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ .	-4.1708
Haslach : Skepticism shines with Fusion	-4.8338
For example , the 2015 parish parish parish election will change in the Haslach ( SE ) maritime unit .	-3.5337
Then there is only a common parish state for all six parishes .	-3.4426
In a joint meeting on Saturday , the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welshnstein prepared for the changes .	-3.9344
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese have nothing to change and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-3.9602
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism about the new is slow but increasingly hesitant to see confidence .	-5.0492
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish community , the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the head officers of the Seelsorget team were all about .	-5.4292
On the basis of a presentation , Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt outlined the newly formulated guidelines for naval units in the archdiocese of Freiburg .	-5.5182
In the future , the SE Haslach , as a parish of the church , forms a public law body that enters into the rights and obligations of the six different church communities to date .	-6.0805
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish is represented .	-3.8914
Each parish is supposed to represent at least two elected members , and so-called community teams are formed on the spot in the six parish .	-4.8975
Their task will be to promote religious life in the field in the future .	-4.2711
The question of the finances of the individual parish parish communities has then been very much discussed .	-5.7033
The innovations provide that collected credits are maintained in the parish ’ s purposes . , , . , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8403
The liabilities go against the general public .	-2.8275
Particularly in view of the major planned investments , whose commitment then applies to all the parallels , there were serious concerns .	-6.1244
" In the past , only projects that could be handled by the individual parishes alone have been invested , " relativized Haslach ’ s parish community chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-4.6714
Practical experience with a common body for five parks shifted barbarbar knights , the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald-Neuried Seelorgeunit .	-6.7827
In 2006 , they set themselves the task of ' becoming one , five ' and had to realise that it is not so easy .	-6.4462
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorgeunit were then asked to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish community and the practical work of the community teams .	-4.5583
The preparations will be concrete in future meetings and will be adopted in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-3.0248
In the end , Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelor Unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-3.8845
In Ppullendorf , the current becomes more expensive .	-2.6264
Pullendorf 's citizens must face higher electricity costs .	-3.0493
As the Managing Director of the towns , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed against the SUDKURIER , a four-man Paullendorf family has an increase of 70 to 90 euros per year .	-5.4092
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the so-called EEC circulation from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.0937
This circuit is redefined each year by the four operators of the big electric road .	-4.8975
These indicate the additional costs incurred for them from the energy transformation , which they can collect by publishing over the electricity price .	-5.6188
Pullendorf is the last link in this chain .	-2.6398
The Supervisory Board of the energy company , in its forecasts , even assumed a higher volume , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-4.8457
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the towns could inform their customers next week about the exact price increase .	-4.2267
" We are going from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , according to Bias , where the number will be closer to the 2 cents .	-4.6677
Ample on permanent red : Eight waiting time	-2.9139
Sometimes a traffic light simply will not be green .	-2.0996
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is defective .	-3.4954
What should we do - go to red ?	-3.2190
Has a person waiting long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , says Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-10.7192
But the waiting time must be " reasonable " , which could be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.0634
Becker advises to stay for at least five minutes before the traffic light fails .	-3.7951
Whoever continues to drive despite redlight , however , must be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by this .	-4.1349
Anyone who is patient less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Hamm Supreme Court .	-3.8024
In the case , after approximately three minutes , a driver had ignored the traffic light and was responsible for a negligent breach of red light .	-5.5285
The traffic light was not defective , but spoke a little later on green .	-4.3943
He was still banned for the particular situation - but not the fine .	-5.5492
The Municipal Council looks forward to sound budgets .	-3.9380
Whenever budgetary meetings are concerned , Mayor Ralph Gerster is well laughing .	-2.5555
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled , and debt has not known the administration since 2005 .	-4.4180
The 2012 budget year can also be taken as a full success in this sense .	-2.7874
This became clear in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .	-1.6803
As Andrea Rothmund has pointed out , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million has exceeded EUR 1 million more than was .	-8.0359
The administrative surplus , too , is around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-3.5395
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial taxes and the municipal share of income taxes .	-3.8377
The wealth budget was also well above the planned values .	-2.9492
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged last year , it was EUR 2.5 million .	-1.7194
" This is essentially due to the increased administrative budget , " says Rothmund .	-2.9096
Since less investment was made in the 2012 budget year than was scheduled , repatriation has also been higher .	-4.8883
Overall , the general reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-5.4795
Ralph Gerster , Mayor , thought about Rothmund and her team for the good work .	-3.4678
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of the sleeve , " praised Gerster with a view to the annual bill .	-4.0838
He and the local councils were delighted with the good figures .	-8.1188
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon get expensive .	-3.3011
The good financial situation allowed the municipality to renounce high halts in the past .	-4.5630
However , that in turn would have been reduced , according to Gerster , on many occasions , grants from the .	-4.9451
These subsidies are subject to several compensatory kinds .	-3.4957
Among other things , the towns and municipalities that apply for grants must have certain margins .	-3.6820
" We have to look at the subject of lifting because investments we would like to have grants in the years to come are announced in this context .	-5.8338
Nagold : Hugo Wermter has been in the choir for 60 years .	-1.2357
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the Cécilia male band is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , where he was solemnly honored .	-4.3028
As usual , Hubert Wermter stood on stage in the colors of his male band .	-6.3058
Even after 60 years , he still enjoys singing with the choir , which has become more than loved .	-5.5505
He was also active in the association , for 28 years as a member of the committee .	-3.1239
He received several awards for his commitment and his collaboration : Jörg Kohr , Pastoral referent on behalf of the Rottenburg-Stuttgart Cäcilian Association , he submitted a certificate of the Association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-6.0649
His fellow singers handed over to him the ceremony of the German Choral Association as well as an engraved penteller .	-6.3286
In addition to the honour , the 31st autumn festival laid on the usual tracks : with the MGV Betra , the song of salt stetts , the Baisingen singer department and the local music club , the full marriers had loaded a colourful mix of different choirs and vocal styles that had undergone around 400 visitors .	-7.5884
The MGV full maringe opened with atmospheric songs such as " Im Weinparadise " and " Lustig , her brothers " .	-3.8863
They prepared their honorary singer Hubert Wermter a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-4.3498
The Men ’ s Sanger Club Betra also sang classic choral songs such as Julius Wengert , " Weight , far away " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-5.7697
The song " Salzstetten " was produced by his mixed choir and his female group - the " Impulschor " - for the festival 's quota .	-4.4608
The mixed choir kidnapped " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " by Antos Gus in foreign countries , while the " Impulschor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their programme .	-9.3046
The singer department of the Baising Sports Association came back to home with " Which der Schwab ? " by Hans Küssmuth and Robert Papperts " Bierlied " , where the Fullmaring Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree .	-5.8753
For the children there was a small side-program - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a chicken theatre and read a few stories which the children were lunch busy .	-6.0882

Kenyan press outrages controversial media law .	-1.9743
“ We are in a worrying situation and we can ask ourselves what Parliament believes it is about simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was to read in the newspaper that believes the draft law is unconstitutional .	-6.7849
“ The law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , CEO of the Capital Group , one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya .	-2.9461
He said that the new media ibunal “ will always be preceded , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.9591
“ I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and to send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.7514
According to The Star , the new law “ effectively puts the media in a strange , ” whereas the standard , democracy , and freedom of speech in Kenya “ suffered a severe blow , ” prompting the draft as “ draconian . ”	-5.2974
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Western Gate shopping centre in September .	-3.6568
The Kenyan media attracted the anger of the authorities because they published photographs of security cameras on which the units posted on the offices allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre .	-5.3761
Police chief David Kimaiyo reacted to interrogating two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the presentation was withdrawn after a media cry .	-4.1185
According to the new law , media houses can be punished by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to one million , and the other risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-3.5972
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-7.7842
According to Daily Nation , “ one penalty can force most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.6956
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on Kenya ’ s description of Kenya ’ s “ lively blogosphere . ”	-3.2867
If they silenced the media , politicians could do with impunity whatever they want .	-2.3361
“ No one will ever know it , ” Mutuma Mathiu wrote , journalist at the nation that calls the Kenyan media a decisive factor in public life .	-3.4629
“ Leaving politicians to themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy , and back to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-4.2295
Kenyan legislators have long been raising public anger .	-5.6556

Already 15 years ago , there were the first considerations to resolve the problem , when a third place was conceived at the football club site or at the real school at Salinensee .	-10.4205
Both have been rejected .	-0.5567
Six years ago , we had thought about creating an art grass sports place , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .	-4.9244
Concrete plans were included two years ago , when the FC took over the theft in the inheritance package , EUR 100 000 was allocated to the construction of the place and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000 .	-6.4641
In October 2012 , the municipal Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 to the total costs of EUR 560 000 , plus the sum . .	-7.7702

There was a threat of divergence on land roads , which are already key areas of accident .	-5.0293
Furthermore , from Pronold 's point of view , the introduction of a toll for all cars would be just a first step .	-3.6173

Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .	-1.7273
As Airport Speaker Peter Kleemann announced against Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport is following an international trend when it comes to setting forecasts that affect individual people . .	-9.3749
The airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai , among others , have already abandoned the noise calls .	-3.6050
Due to the disappearance of these speeches - on average , about 200 personal calls from speakers in one day - it should take a quiet time at the airport .	-7.5408
" It has also been shown in experience that these individual passengers have not been perceived in a relatively small way , but at the same time all other information on modified flights or departures is slightly declining here , " Kleemann said in talks with the radio station .	-7.9513

There are also plant alternatives for eggs .	-1.6007
Half crushed , mature banana , for example , can replace an egg as a binding agent in a cake .	-3.1098
Also 50 grams of apple or a dining suffle worn linen plus three dining suits are suitable for this .	-5.0954
Lots of dogs are made of egg , for example , with a mixture of a tea spoon baking powder , a dining suit , and three dining suits of mineral water .	-8.6100

Also this year , a Hubertus fair is celebrated on the name day of the Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Maria on the Hülsbergstrasse .	-4.7046
St. Hubertus was the legend of a rather ruthless hunter who was revealed by a vision and later appointed Bishop of Liege .	-4.5453
The hunting group of the Hunter Westfalen under the leadership of Brigitte Kluth musicized on Parforceeörn ( Natural Warlocks in the mood It ) by old , French melodies .	-7.3645

The newly designed option shines with a new cafe .	-2.1553
One that invites you to stay and to come again .	-7.3104
One who wants to make the name a program .	-2.0738
According to Lexicon , Dejà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling that a new situation is already experienced or seen .	-4.5651
In case of visiting the cafés of the same name in the Kleve district , visiting the Rhine-Waal University , it must not remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-5.7040
After all , the café with its beautiful name is precisely the goal : to make a real stay not only thoughtful but also to be able to live again and again .	-6.6812
Because it 's fun and easy to find .	-1.9833
A view of the inner life of the opposite 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at Anhieb .	-5.1285
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel good .	-3.7654
Here , the team with founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner pampers the guest with a variety of coffee and cocktail variants .	-4.7818
The cakes and fresh baguettes are also included .	-4.6322
The owners , both 33 years old , have made a name even before the opening of the decorative café at the opening of the cathedral : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-6.6494
The sympathetic café lovers hope for more audience from moving to Kleve .	-3.8059
Not least also by the university .	-2.6399
" If we don 't have a specific target group , " Daniel Büttner stresses .	-2.9961
In fact , the two students here who are young people would like to mention the same thing as seniors and all age groups .	-5.5703

Two events were already at the bright café .	-3.1935
Better one .	-1.9124
The harbour festival took place outside the hotel - the café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.4359
But there was also the Ring Natural evening .	-2.7625
" Beautiful , successful and joyful " , the two 33 year-olds found .	-3.0101
But not everyone ’ s thing .	-2.2992
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a spoken fan of event evening either : " You can 't make every right " .	-4.4006
And with an event I 'm always talking about only those interested in the special event .	-3.7093
Events will therefore be the exception to us .	-2.4830
" We do not want to disturb the normal operation as much as possible " .	-3.5553
Should be hot : Déjà Vu stands also for reliability .	-3.2187

UN announces New Goals to Fight Poverty	-2.6771
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty .	-3.6538
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals .	-3.3037
They have been included in the final draft document which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-2.9598
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.0711
“ I am delighted that the member states agreed to embark on a process to agree universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.7694
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework .	-2.3624
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by the member states to realise our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.5574
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the upper hand ball lists still feel good .	-4.0966
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt at all .	-2.3286
Everyone is still fully motivated in this matter .	-2.5492
However , I hope that we can finally win again .	-2.7582
" For I don 't know how such a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.0166
Although the Third League Reserve from Fredenbeck currently has not run out trees , Malmon is raising the finger in advance .	-5.4962
I trained many players myself in the A Youth .	-3.4376
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-2.2902
" We must also wait for the SG-Coach to be reinforced from the first , " expl.	-5.1753
To finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must certainly increase compared with the previous performances .	-4.2823
Above all in the coverage and in the switch game it was really big .	-7.3102
The recycling of opportunities must also definitely improve .	-2.1859
So I hope that my players will finally have their head released during the short break .	-3.3854
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-2.0696
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the vigilant eyes of the Samora Machel statue , the founder of state and first President Mozambique , in order to vote for a rare public demonstration of peace .	-4.9473
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.6217
Due to fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her business clothing against a T-shirt with the label “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined on Thursday the volume on the Independence Square of the capital .	-6.2373
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst fighters since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-2.9225
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , supported initially by White Rhodes and later by South Africa ’ s apartment-government , seeking to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.7779
Following the 1992 Peace Treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.7622
Analysts believe that the country is unlikely to fall back into a full-blown conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-2.8904
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , as the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal stocks in the north-west could generate over $ 50 billion of US firms like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-5.8128
The ruling Frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo both blame for tensions .	-2.7323
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the most recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province on 17 October , a traditional Hochburg Renamos .	-3.3119
The attacks on previous rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , explained Renamo ’ s spokesman against the Financial Times .	-9.1762
The government blames Renamo for clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.0486
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-2.1401
Contrary to AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama looks like “ losers , ” who wants “ to use all of his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.6288
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasize that they want to avoid war .	-2.3110
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words : Renamo admits the 1992 peace agreement .	-2.9577
He told the FT that he meant that Frelimo stopped respecting the agreement .	-3.7158
“ Our vision is to re-open negotiations seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-1.6453
Previous inter-party talks have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a number of clashes this year .	-3.6539
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who join the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , a docent at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-4.1344
None of them is well negotiated and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-1.4273
Renamo , pushing for electoral reforms , has already stated that she will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.4381
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .	-1.6500
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a sick movement to obtain concessions and financial concessions from the government .	-2.6710
Renamo ’ s electoral success has shrunk since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Democrático de Moçambique ( MDM ) , will likely improve in elections .	-3.7548
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation comes when his second term in office next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.2244
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.3874
The Renamo capacity is unclear , but it has made unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south connections .	-3.4364
Most of the fighters took place in the province of Sofala , which is some hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but which is in Beira , the port , the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-5.5381
In June , Rio suspended using the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-3.0718
Mazanga replied reticently to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-3.1914
Renamo wanted to “ the international community warn that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-3.1998
Instability has increased the frustration of the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people were concerned about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent wave of abduction .	-4.2223
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country , and should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.1746
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.4226
“ No interest Renamo and Frelimo , they just want to restore peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-3.5416
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models for life ” , says an author .	-3.2952
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal power has no chance of clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-3.1296
Many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland pleaded for a “ careful selection of ” ancient works .	-4.2117
“ I find it wonderful that America ’ s myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-2.3451
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-1.6815
He added that , among authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ shut off completely , ” because , in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ underweight . ”	-5.0049
Crossley Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon , and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in your background . ”	-4.3007
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to give hope .	-3.3543
Not everything must be simplified or lead to hapy end , but there is an inherent sense of good and evil .	-3.2851
It must be understated , history has revealed , not declared .	-4.0567
This is the old story of showing instead of talking .	-2.0412

Haslach ’ s mayor , Heinz Winkler , gave the honour to the award of the honor citizen , who , in representation of the then official holder , Hättech , together with some of the city ’ s council , made his expectation .	-7.0728
Their expectation then made the three-royal singer , who called Hansjakob to the cry : " Oh how beautiful , there are youth reminders of my own tri-king-time alive " .	-8.3105
With her song " O Jesulin " they enjoyed the audience at the Freihof as well as the Storchendags with their loud " Edition , Edition " .	-6.4707
Hansyakob 's criticism of the Church of the Treaty of Amsterdam was also expressed at that time as his concerns about agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .	-6.5736
In his homeland , behind his tomb band at Hofstetten , he found his quiet area .	-7.2735
" A disquieting spirit had finally found its peace and had gone forever , " it said at the end of the scene .	-2.8327
There was lots of applause and loud words from the audience for the performance .	-3.5185

Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily in land .	-1.5538
They distribute the coal coming from ships to their hands .	-7.3990
The company also operates several irons in fire .	-3.3293
In addition to coal imports , Rhenus Midgard relies , among other things , on wind plant logistics .	-2.8879
Black shifts the coal on the storage place before the deich .	-3.5977

The Court is blocking decision on the NYPD Stop-and-fresh Directive	-3.0340
A Federal Tribunal in the USA blocked the order of a judge on Thursday who had called for changes to the Stop-and-Frisk Programme ( “ Stop-and-Search ” ) of the New York police department , and disbanded the judge from the case .	-5.2840
The 2nd US appeal court declared that judge Shira Sheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until the city ’ s vocation was decided .	-3.7568
The judge was judged in August that the city was in breach of the Constitution with the manner in which the program for the stakes and surveys of individuals was implemented .	-5.4749
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies ordered , including the decision to set up a supervisory body to support the police in amending its directive and the appropriate training programme .	-4.8483
The appeal court listened to the arguments on Tuesday .	-1.9244
The appeal report declared that the judge should be removed from the case , as it violated the Code of Conduct for US Justice by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of party , partly based on a number of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the Court 's criticism .	-5.7196
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were unreasonably targeted black and Latin American men targeting the stop-and-fresh programme .	-3.9492
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of substantial changes , including reforms to directives , training and supervision , and ordered a pilot program with cameras born on the body in quarters where most controls were carried .	-4.9195
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were dismissed after police control .	-3.3377
Oral negotiation of the appeal of the city is scheduled after 14 March 2014 .	-3.5770
The stop-and-fresh tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates .	-3.0142
Such controls have existed in various forms for decades , but the number of checks recorded during the term of partial mayor Michael Bloomberg rose to an all-time high of 684.330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-3.6719

Opponents believe that the changes would dampen police morality , but not crime ; neither would money waste , nor would the wider problem of a police that is under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of posts in the last decade .	-5.1979
The judge pointed out that they did not end the stop-and-fresh practice , which is constitutional , but only reform the nature of NYPD implementation .	-5.1983

Coulson set phone hacking to check a tip .	-3.0775
The earlier news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson allegedly “ telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation ” when trying to confirm a false tip about a affair of the then Minister of Interior Charles Clarke .	-16.0367
Andrew Edis QC prosecutor explained to the court at the Old Bailey , News of the World in May 2005 a false rumor that Clarke would have a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.8402
The newspaper charged Glenn Mulcaire ’ s private detective to hack Pawlby voicemails , and pursued them , but Colson also called her and left messages as the court learned .	-5.1928
" According to the Public Prosecutor 's Office , Coulson , now the publisher of the NotW , is no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to take her fresh action , but is one who likes to confront people with a history to see her reaction , " said Edis .	-6.5786
He said , NotW uses three methods to research stories investably : telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation .	-4.6727
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.3328
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , and it cannot be otherwise .	-3.5754
What is the situation with the first ?	-1.6057
Do he know about the phone hacking ?	-1.9005
He disputes that , but we say , ‘ And whether he knew it . ’	-2.5465
Rumors about a Clarkes affair were first picked up by NotW ’ s feature edition , when a source of sexual interest to Pawlby was said : “ Don ’ t waste your time , it is compiled with Charles . ”	-5.2668
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was ensured in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006 .	-3.4297
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer on which Pawlby and their sisters were stored as “ projects . ”	-3.0201
At the time the research was carried out , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls to which they were asked for information about them , declared Edis . , , , , .	-9.2017
Meanwhile , former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former Reporter James Weatherup supervised the movement of Pawlby .	-2.8061
On June 18 , 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-3.8707
Edis explained that Coulson 's activities on this story followed the same pattern as other important figures , such as the former interior minister David Blunkett .	-3.7864
The juries heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he was lied with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at that time .	-5.1114
Coulson and Brooks argue to have sworn with others to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-4.5269
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup approved the phone hacking .	-2.2349

Getting : No absolute protection possible	-2.3045
" We want to incorporate the inhabitants into the planning early " , " Mayor Jens Häussler opened the Citizens Information Protection Centre in Gechingen .	-5.8740
Around 80 participants had entered the community to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and bring forward ideas .	-4.6129
Häussler made it clear that the ultimate decisions are the members of the local council .	-4.9050
The flood that unprepared the battle on 15 May 2009 was a radical event that raised the question of protective measures for the future , according to builders .	-5.2436
River Research was commissioned with the neighbouring community Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the concept of flood protection in Gechingen .	-3.9195
" Protection of as many buildings as possible is the goal " , according to builders .	-4.3007
The planning of protection is based on statistical floods expected every 100 years according to the German weather service .	-4.3531
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percentage supplement .	-2.4585
This is called " HQ 100aKlima " in speci.	-3.4951
The water masses that had caused considerable damage in 2009 in Gechingen corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood .	-3.2062
" There is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve " , says Häussel.	-3.6864
To obtain the protection of HQ 100a Climate , around EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality predicting approximately 70 % of national grants .	-5.2509
Häussler pointed out , however , that it would only give support if a general concept were implemented .	-5.3817
For that purpose , the community needs the citizens ' participation .	-3.9743
An expensive planning and authorisation procedure must be completed .	-2.6516
In the best case , implementation could start in 2016 .	-1.7303
Among other things , the concept of protection that was presented last week in the municipal Council ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the inflow of the Irm river from the Home Valley .	-5.5665
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , the participants took the opportunity to bring their concerns to light .	-8.4508
Among other things , there has been a question of why no more dams and restraint basins are planned to protect the place .	-3.7485
Gregor Kühn , specialist planner of the commissioned Engineering Office Forest and Corbe from Hilsheim , who presented the concept , emphasized that it needed the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-5.4208
In addition , one can find the most economical solution , according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-7.0897
There was unpleasure in the case of the ancestors who , even in normal thweather rains , suffered from overloading the channel network .	-8.5457
The problem is known for administration and first measures have already been taken .	-3.4071
Häussler pointed out , however , that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection , and should not be mixed .	-4.6819
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain may be dealt with .	-4.6889
Increasing sewage channels would swallow millions .	-3.6008
Heavy injured after collision	-3.4594
On Friday afternoon , two drivers close to Revensdorf were seriously injured on the Landessstraße 44 during a frontal collision .	-4.5727
The police immediately shut down the road , but there was little to say at first of all about the accident .	-5.0566
However , there are several witness statements that should be evaluated first .	-3.1136
It is clear that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW golf went to Revensdorf and the 38-year-old Gettorf man met with his Hyundai .	-4.4110
Both vehicles collided , with the woman dressed so hard that the fire brigade needed just half an hour to get rid of it from the vehicle wreck .	-4.8275
The actual accident in the first place remained unresolved .	-2.8096
Both disasters came to nearby hospitals .	-1.8593
The route remained approximately two hours full .	-2.4797

Amazing exterior kindness : the constant eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-4.2786
And just as Fjodor M. Dostoyevski understands his massive Oeuvre as the founder and apologist of the Russian soul , Philip K. Dick is a American prophet , which is very much in his own country .	-6.1112

Dick explains America - the kingdom of breathtaking technical progress , coupled with paranoia , security chaos , and the belief to be .	-3.7482
Dick had God ’ s experiences , his late books read as a mixture of the revelation of the John and a computer manual .	-2.7853
Perhaps he was crazy , drugs had put his brain on .	-2.2554
He has captured , early on , that the machines are divinities .	-3.1277
He wrote a computer theology and asked what a person distinguishes from a machine , the creator from his creation .	-2.9236

James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , insisted in September that the US did not use any possibilities of foreign pioneering to “ steal foreign business secrets on behalf of US firms to expand their international competitiveness or profit . ”	-4.5188
But , since Edward Snowden , who became a whistleblower , has begun to publish his full horn of US surveillance secrets , European governments and business leaders are no longer certain whether they can take the lead in their word .	-5.2566
Reports that the American National Security Agency has pioneered the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought the company ’ s paranoia to a new peak for state surveillance .	-4.3019

Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found in an upright position on January 11 , behind the gallery in the Schulturnhalle .	-5.3688
The investigative officers of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but the 17-year-old family is doubtful .	-4.2099
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , opposed to FoxNews.com.	-2.9121
They would never have believed that he died as the Sheriff conclu.	-3.6800
“ They believe there is no logic to violate the laws of physics and common sense , ” Crump said .	-10.1310
Instead , they are convinced that the truth is being hidden to protect the person or persons responsible for the death of their son .	-3.2735
“ Your son went to school and got back in the wreck , ” he commented .	-3.1703
US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there would be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , because a number of important issues have yet to be resolved .	-3.9133
What was the cause of death ?	-0.4724
Is his death at the root of a crime ?	-2.9568
This explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.4764
I follow the facts in which they lead .	-1.2135
My goal is to find out the truth .	-0.9849
“ I take the view that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.2026
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsy suggests that Johnson died of the consequences of “ position-related stimulus . ”	-4.1228
A second autopsy , however , has caused another cause of death , Moore said .	-2.7359
“ There are a number of questions that have to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-2.1497

CDC publishing Allergic Guidelines for Schools	-2.0727
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a set of guidelines for the use of food-allergies of children in schools .	-3.0881
These are the first such guidelines that the US Administration has issued , as the number of children guilty of food allergies is rising .	-3.9310
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.8360
According to the CDC between 1997 and 2007 , the proliferation of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % .	-3.0557
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children , who show allergic reactions .	-3.3584
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrin stock – the auto injection of the EpiPen brand is most used – to respond to a potentially lethal over-sensitivity response .	-5.0502
Lawyers in states have recently changed the rules to enable schools to keep epinephrin easier .	-4.5711
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic reaction .	-2.5596
Children may say : “ It feels like pushing something to my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair lies on it , ” or “ My tongue criticizes ” .	-4.9594
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ sex incorrect ” .	-2.7722
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is acknowledged for children born with non-clear genitals .	-3.2621
New borns are no longer rigid or female .	-2.6275
According to the new law , parents no longer need to declare a gender for such children , but can specify ‘ unfair ’ or ‘ not fixed ’ on the birthrate .	-4.6499
The aim of the law is to exert pressure from parents so that they do not have to make any hasty decisions regarding operations for the allocation of gender among newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-4.6514
An intersexual person later said , according to BBC years : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.5147
I remain the flickwork created by doctors mutilated and scared .	-3.8764
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children is neither boys nor girls every year .	-3.1977
They are among the intersexuals , a group that falls under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( egg sticks or hodes ) or unusually developed genital .	-5.8203
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.0546
The understanding of gender sterilization is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if it is impossible to determine and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before , if anything , deciding for surgery .	-5.9125
The New York Psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialised in the problem of gender dentification , said the new German law “ sounds a good thing . ”	-4.0894
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-0.8014
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but that is not true for most children , ” he said .	-3.0005
You can assign sex without operation and then wait for identity to develop .	-3.3686
The scientific data on how a child evolves its sexual identity is not very precise .	-2.8741
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.2673
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.5711
In a 2011 report to the European Commission , it says that intersexual people are distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not based on sex , but on their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-5.6344
These characteristics were shown in subordinate sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , bearing , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , chromosomosomic structures and hormones .	-5.5574
The report also gives an overview of the discrimination which is facing intersexual and transgender people in work and the extent of harassment , violence and discrimination .	-4.0064
There is now a special camp not compatible with the gender image .	-3.8022
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to specify male , female , or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.1844
In June , Australian Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ sexless ” person , after a court granted lifelong retention of an “ unspecified ” gender status .	-4.6389
In addition to M and W , in future , a third assignment , X for intersexual , such as the Ministry of the Interior .	-3.9673
In neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , such as a news report on France 24 .	-2.9095
In 2011 , dozens of French MEPs signed a petition to the strictly Catholic country that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.6604
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed the German law , on the grounds that “ if the world is torn into a new state , where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we are distorting two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-5.1621
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared against Baby Zone , she would find it better for babies to be given gender at birth .	-4.5800
“ The parent ’ s daytime is stresssful enough even without any restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of his own child , ” she said to the parent website .	-6.1014
Children need stability and security .	-0.7897
Historically , children born with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites , after the attractive Greek god , who had both sexes .	-3.5999
Ten years ago , medicine viewed the gender as something that one could erase and rebuild .	-3.4567
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , knowing how complex the gender identity is , and doctors may be wrong because they do not know how to grow up with the gender they allocate .	-5.4315
“ In the mid-twentieth century , this was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-2.8267
If such a child was born , then we called not the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-3.2051
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with non-clear genital comes back to Dr. John Money from John 's Hopkins University , who took the view that the sex is formable .	-4.6209
He shaped the term “ sexual identity ” and argued that social and environmental injuries – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , and in such a way that a person regarded as male or female .	-5.3630
But , in a case known as the “ John / Joan ” case dating from 1966 , his theories were controversial .	-2.6692
He advocated the parents of a boy whose penis had been removed from a sombre circumcision , casting the child completely and removing his soil and then taking it as a girl .	-7.8484
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion , but he was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.6897
When the boy was about 15 , he returned to the male sex and married a woman .	-1.6873
But he committed suicide with 38 .	-2.0092
According to the Dresser , doctors who would practice this model are still .	-7.1034
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the Internet ’ s arrival , survivors of these gender operations have come to the public , “ not happy with the outcome . ”	-4.0765
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36 year old author from Montana who was born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genital .	-2.9068
Doctors were not aware of whether he had a large klitoris or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-4.0306
So his external organ and the Hoden were removed shortly after the birth of 1976 surgically and was attracted as girls .	-5.0718
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.5060
“ I knew I ’ m not a girl , ” he explained ABCNews.com about ABCNews.com .	-2.7345
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.6388
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-2.4061
But , because he was depressive and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical acts .	-2.9972
What he found out was shocking .	-0.5891
I was sterilised at my birth – and nobody ever told me that .	-2.4122
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals .	-2.9334
After experiencing the truth , he switched back to male identity , received Testosteron injections and left his breasts removed .	-4.3004
The operation became infertile .	-1.8724
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for the normal perception of intersexual people .	-3.0746
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , California-based Legal Group Advocates for Informed Choice , worries that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.0041
“ Many activists worry that Germany ’ s decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and to grant ‘ child ’ , they declared .	-4.1007
We fear this will encourage intervention .	-2.6571
We think it would be better to allocate male or female gender and then wait .	-2.3538
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.1412
Tamar-Mattis said that their organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognise it as a third gender . ”	-3.9743
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-3.1277
The German law is about the allocation of birth .	-2.6818
This is not a battle to force small children at this stage .	-3.5424
When they are adults , they can decide their own bodies .	-3.3825
But Dr Arlene Baratz , a Pittsburg breast tradiologist who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law says “ empowered ” both parents and children .	-5.2580
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete androgen resistance .	-3.1634
Catie of female characteristics has been developed due to the receptor defect of the target cells for Testosteron .	-4.3484
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-2.0222
Today , Katie 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a employee in psychiatry .	-3.5338
Although it is infertile , it hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-3.0177
“ The law gives parents space , which does not need to make overwhelming decisions , ” said Baratz .	-3.5474
It gives them the time to do different tests and to clarify things and gives them time before writing “ male ” or “ female ” .	-3.5739
In this way everything is fine – you draw the child big and love it .	-3.5131
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy your parental luck .	-3.5669
And we do not need to hurry out an operation that can no longer be undone .	-3.8896
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that robs parents because they think they are not doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-3.9568
Ultimately , the child decides on the gender that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful .	-2.7876
This will enable children to take the decision themselves .	-2.3081
Unknown injured girls by car shot	-2.8767
Unknown infringements of twelve years in Saxony-Anhalt when bombing from a car .	-4.9865
The perpetrators presumably fired an air pressure on a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin .	-2.8944
The police joined Burg .	-3.2329
The girl was easily injured on the left .	-2.0633
Rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .	-1.1872
The shot came from a small car that had passed along a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-4.2238
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.0463
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .	-1.3737
A disc broke .	-1.1545
They then went on .	-2.1214
The criminal police stated that it was on Friday .	-1.9526
Until now , the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet halloy night .	-3.8384
The officials were called only twice as hasty children , who thrown them against house barriers .	-5.7304
As the owners recognized this in time and removed the egg remains , no material damage will have arisen .	-4.8185
Furthermore , some sylvester bullers in the city area were probably inflicted , but no material damage was done here either .	-7.1981
A resident of the Bishop Friendorfer route reported that his cars were enclosed with a cloppy and his cycling blends were removed .	-6.9413

Actually , Waltraud Ries has a wonderful residence .	-4.6899
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with plenty of green , old tree estate , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-4.2854
The city is only a few minutes by public transport .	-2.5409
" You hopefully have no fear of spinning ? " , Waltrud Ries asks and shows a fat spider at the door frame .	-4.0080
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-1.6317
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.2308
The reason , however , is no spinning phobia , but rather the concern that at age the many staircases can no longer be handled in the house and in the apartment , explains them .	-6.0806
In addition , since a menissus operation , the mid-fifty has had to know their own body , which means moving with handicap from Stockwerk to Stockwerk .	-5.8589
Just recently is a book of her published about ' Luckily live in old - What form is the best for me ? ' .	-4.2048
'Our apartment is the best example of what you don 't do at all ' , it starts telling them .	-4.6456
When she moved with her husband to Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.1177
Today , with mid-fifty , Waltrud Ries thinks otherwise .	-2.9032
She is also aware , however , that she is one of the few people who discuss ' living at old ' at all .	-4.2301
Most are squeezing out as long as it .	-2.9785
Old are only the others ' , says dirty .	-3.2717
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great will it be worth thought .	-4.6597
'Then it may be too late ' , according Ries .	-3.4654
In their book , the interior architect introduces 17 living models for self-determined living at age .	-4.3744
Which form you choose is always an individual decision , explains it .	-2.5529
D i e solution does not provide for age .	-2.3604
Even if you can afford the retirement of Tuscany or Brittany , you should always consider that it could also be ill .	-4.9612
And : ' Without good knowledge of the language of the country , you also combine in the Dolce Vita , ' gives the specialist book author of dispatch .	-7.2871
Among their models are classic maintenance models , alternative forms of housing , or the often cited pensioner WG .	-8.1414
At age , everyone has such ticks and macks .	-9.3570
" For me this would be a flat community but nothing , " she says with an eye cock .	-4.7329
Even not like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-3.2597
" At age you just need your shuttle " , according to Ries .	-5.2166
The book author does not want to rule out the possibility that a community of senior housing can still work .	-3.5619
But this should be done differently from the classic Studenten-WG .	-3.3634
And sometimes you just want his rest , " she believes .	-3.6097
It does not stand alone , at least in the capital of the country .	-3.3573
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home " , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the Citizens Service Life at the age of the State Capital .	-4.5543
Their department consults people around ' Older become ' .	-4.6479
That is why it is very often the elderly who would take advantage of inconvenience and constraints to stay in their usual surroundings , and that is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest Foundation .	-6.9211
There are many possibilities today to make the house or apartment accessible .	-3.9857
Ries recommends to all those who are concerned about the renovation of their house or their apartment , to be informed once and for all , and not to commission the best craftsmen .	-7.9749
Today there are also specialists for the adjustment of age .	-3.8546
Even in the rental flat this can be realized in one or the other , and if it is only the toiletries increase , the interior architects clarify .	-6.1351
But it is not always possible to rent an old flat without any barrier , even if it is still so beautiful .	-4.9918
This experience had to make Waltrud Ries .	-1.4151
It would have been nice to install a staircase in the apartment , but it would be a far larger obstacle to the housing .	-7.8966
She will continue to search until she found the ideal object for her and her husband .	-2.0001
Before moving it , you are greeted more than before the spinning on your home .	-4.9915
The United States wants to pursue Snowden further in criminal law .	-3.0284
The US has not changed its stance as former US intelligence workers Edward Snowden .	-2.4505
He will continue to be accused of passing on secret information without permission .	-3.7787
As a result , he had to face criminal proceedings in the US , said the spokesman of the US Department of Foreign Affairs , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-4.4189
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this either .	-2.7736
Prior to that , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , had appealed to the US not to threaten him further .	-3.6108
Psaki stressed that the words of a Member of Parliament are Ströbel , not that of a German member .	-5.5097
Intellectual Workers Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities .	-4.9616
But first he wants to clarify his situation .	-1.4433
This has been made clear to the former NSA staff in an unaddressed letter published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , Bundestag and General Bundesag .	-4.9361
The letter has the following wording after a translation spread by strokes :	-3.9477
The competents	-2.5179
I have been asked to write you about your mass surveillance investigation .	-2.1374
I mean Edward Joseph Snowden and was initially contracted or employed by a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-3.5013
During my employment in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of my government , which led me to act out of moral duty .	-4.3943
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and lasting heat that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-4.0019
I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-1.9610
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-1.5008
Citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations to a system of all-embracing surveillance that nobody is accountable to as a service to the public .	-4.1703
Spionage revelations entailed many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence .	-3.4520
The benefits of society from these acquired findings are becoming increasingly clearer ; at the same time , the risks that have been acquired were clearly reduced .	-4.7521
Although the outcome of my efforts has been clearly positive , my government remains a faithful disposition , seeking to criminalise and denounce political opinion .	-6.2322
Still , to speak out the truth is not a crime . . , to . to . to . to . to	-6.0218
I am confident that the US Government , with the support of the international community , will adopt this disastrous attitude .	-2.8821
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to play an appropriate and legal role in the responsible explanation of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.4359
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to safeguard international law that protects us all .	-3.9971

Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-1.3610
" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.8394

The budget was EUR 100 000 .	-1.5618
It is still not clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten .	-2.9164
The Mayor is right that winter lings have passed responsibility for the building before winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to pay for maintenance of the house as to heat , look after the garden and cleaning the walk .	-6.4511

The Times was a copy of the forthcoming book , reporting on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had “ held large-scale meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 , ” to find out whether it would be better for Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election when he drop bids .	-10.1702
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times national correspondent , the book thoroughly describes the history of the efforts of leading members of the campaign and the White House , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect that it has had on the polls to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-President .	-5.0371
The potential change was a strictly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.3775
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and former white House adviser , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the intended change .	-3.7833
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden in spite of their “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before , after all , opting for such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-6.1292
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.2147
“ I said a whole series of things to be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine .	-3.1754
It is worth remembering that the President had awkward surveys at that time , so we thought , “ To God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-4.5275
While Daley called the investigations a “ commanded care , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort had been made during the campaign for re-election to determine whether such a train pays off with regard to the ballot box .	-5.3905
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something , ” Martin said at AC360 .	-3.6673
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange .	-2.4492
Martin said to CNN , he asked Daley whether his boss had known about the potential change .	-2.5370
Although Daley declared that he did not believe that the president “ knew ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it .	-4.0680
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question as to whether the political explosions of Obama ’ s desktop would have been achieved .	-7.9608
Cooper asked Martin whether he thought seriously that Obama knew nothing of the investigation about whether to drop Biden in the elections .	-3.3931
Martin replied “ Possibly ” . , , , , , , , , , , and . , , ,	-5.7041
What is going on on with my email ?	-2.7011
E-mail does indeed mean electronic letters .	-2.2788
Have the letter secrecy been translated in the design of the Internet service e-mail as in the conventional mail ?	-5.8895
The concept of early Internet services focused on making communication possible .	-2.9325
That is why the basic technical protocols have not paid attention to establishing a stable foundation for a hearing safe exchange of letters .	-4.5297
Therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds more to an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-2.8305
If users " Anna " send an e-mail to " Benni " , are the computers of the two directly connected ?	-3.7121
The email program or the browser of Anna will first send the mail to the mail server of their service provider .	-3.4716
For example , if you have a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.4727
This mail server sends the content to the provider that uses Benni .	-2.6473
On the track , the mail can run via several other servers on the internet .	-3.8576
Bennie can then call the contents of his provider .	-1.9176
Will traditional emails be read through the network ?	-2.9200
Most mails are read by software robots on the way .	-2.7185
In the sender 's provider , it is usually checked if the mail carries a malfunction as an attachment .	-4.9196
A virus check is also carried out on recipient systems .	-2.2131
Furthermore , the providers verify whether this is a burdensome and unwanted spam mail that is deleted equally , or at least taken away in a spam folder .	-6.5564
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.2401
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context-advertising .	-3.6507
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail on their next holiday trip , Google may display corresponding links to holiday offers .	-4.7179
Read the unknown people the e-mails with too ?	-3.9498
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail is extremely low .	-2.6843
In theory that is possible .	-1.8036
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.1576
The law enforcement agencies and intelligence services also have legal means of intercepting e-mails or taking note of them .	-4.1562
In addition , possible illegal expression actions are also being taken .	-5.0620
Is it possible to protect e-mails against reading ?	-2.1527
Encryption in accordance with the OpenPGP standard allows you to encrypt an email effectively from reading it .	-4.4878
With a high technical effort it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an email communication , so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom .	-9.4133
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-1.3756
Yahoo and Google , according to an audit by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , play only a subordinate role in the post fields mainly used for privacy .	-4.7119
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail recently fell , GMail of Google could clearly define .	-4.5095
Mother in the forest scars and pensions collected pensions	-4.4772
When his insisted mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.5100
He took the dead in a forest and continued to collect their pensions and carers .	-4.8279
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after the investigation of the police in the forest .	-3.8028
First of all , he concealed the death of the 89 year-olds , then he secured the money for more than one and a half years .	-5.1712
Now , as a speaker said on Friday , the 67 year-old has to answer for fraud .	-3.0181
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-3.0008
As suspected , the man was suspected in May : at that time , no medicines were needed for the nursing mother .	-4.4362
The investigators told the pensioners that his mother traveled to Spain .	-2.7698
Because officials saw this terribly happening , they proceeded .	-4.3314
It was found that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years , and that he had last maintained it .	-5.7551
The 67 year-old , after all , admitted the death of his mother .	-2.4235
According to the police , obduction showed no evidence of a capital crime .	-6.1138
Are you looking for ice cream lit in the dark ?	-8.1983
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice – with qualities in the dark .	-4.1037
Charlie Francis exploited the fluorescent characteristics of the oceans and created a shining delicacy .	-4.0486
The idea came to him after he had read a research about torment and persuaded Chinese scientists to make the bright protein artificial .	-5.0082
The ice cream responds with the tongue , which increases the pH value in protein and triggers the light .	-4.1136
Chris explains that the eating ice responds to the warmth in the mouth and light – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-3.9615
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early phase of production , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-4.3895
The protein used in the ice cream responds to the tongue with a neutral pH value .	-2.7068
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value and the ice shines .	-2.9504
We have tested it over the past few months and it has appeared to us ideal to bring it to the market in Halloween , because it has this wonderful lighting effect .	-7.8466
It is probably the most expensive ice-cream I have ever produced , because quality illumination is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.4403
Each ball costs me about <unk> 140 .	-1.8657
But for this reason it is delicious .	-3.0654
Charlie ’ s experimental company , located in Bristol , is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-3.9510
But his latest creation should become even more ambitious .	-1.5434
He said , ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ’	-2.0626
This is impossible in itself because of the breaking of light caused by the ice cream , but I suspect we find a way to create it .	-4.2576
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a torque artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-3.4593
The TSV Morsum is still without any item in the Handball Association after six days of play .	-2.7313
The Derby against the TSV Daverden , which celebrated his first victory last weekend , will be released for the Ehler team tomorrow .	-9.1461
This game is a new season for us .	-2.3706
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " adults are behaving optimistic .	-3.6487
At long last , with the exception of the permanent injured Hendrik blohme , he has his full cadder available .	-5.5169
That , too , is how we rely on speed .	-4.0793
We therefore need to minimise our error rate .	-2.5305
First of all , however , we need to increase the coverage , which has left anything but a safe impression .	-4.7584
After the first season victory against North Horn , Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz will be .	-4.9673
The game was , of course , a house number .	-0.8210
But for that reason we are still not favorite , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-3.8922
Nevertheless , Panitz wants to sleep in Morsum to start a series .	-3.3769
Absent will be Jan-Malte Jodate .	-2.2125
For this , the A-youth Joost Windßüss , who is active in HC Bremen 's A-Youth Bundesliga , is celebrating his seasonal battle .	-7.1729
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.4523
Halloween 2013 : In numbers	-1.6787
When I was small , Halloween had something magic .	-1.8978
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and hide for the neighbourhood .	-3.3454
Today , I have become a halloy buffle .	-4.4615
Over the last two years I have not agreed to distribute from my home from sweetness , and I am sure that this year will not .	-4.8136
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep about hallowers .	-3.0281
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-3.6068
One thing I look forward to every hallowest is the trend values .	-4.6119
The costumes will represent about $ 1.2 billion of the USD 6.9 billion spent , the NRF .	-3.1686
This year , bricky unlived items are the last shrine .	-3.6565
Women no longer have to fill in sexy clothing , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburger or carothing .	-3.8095
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the graft-punk space channels will create this year into the instagram feeds .	-8.7522
According to Google , the most sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-3.0916
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.7590
We dreamed our dogs last year and I am amazed that they were not alone .	-4.0064
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on pets ’ costumes , the NRF .	-1.9869
They are a lot of “ hot dogs ” .	-2.2144
As far as sweetness is concerned , we are not sup.	-3.0240
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.5271
These are approximately 270 million kilograms of chocolates , luchhers , bons and rubber bears .	-5.4388
So good news for the US Trade Department is 41 million people who come across the quarter by the saying ‘ sweet or saures ’ .	-5.6453
In fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not do anything – eat .	-3.4184
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of Sweet Producers .	-4.6762
That is about nine billion maize districts .	-2.6132
It is a puzzle I have not yet been able to solve .	-1.6534
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it spreads .	-3.7561
They have great names like " Terror Behind the Walls " ( which is , moreover , in a real prison ) , " Howl-O scream " and " The House of Shock " .	-3.8758
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States , which are achieving $ 500 million in revenue , America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photos you pink in the trousers , and then put your friends on Facebook , where you will not get rid of them , and one of the type on which you stand , leaves a comment like “ nice face expression . ”	-8.4142
But let us finally get to the puzzles .	-3.5022
Charlie Brown knew us with the great curiosity when we were children , and the cutting of a artist is like the deceit of the Christmas tree – something we made up of small .	-6.0552
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us have grown up cutting the cutter and not sitting in it .	-4.3915
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on disguise , according to the US Census Bureau .	-2.7882
The artists who have slowly rotted in the Vorgarten are probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms have been harvested by Kürbisse . , , and . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.0171
If you want to make the right points , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut some pretty from their 921 kilos .	-11.5754
Housing fire in Helmblaw : Rescue Forces mount enclosed bodies	-9.4824
The fire brigade had to be in Helmbright on the late Thursday evening .	-4.4627
A three-family house in the district of Hof begins the night to a Friday fire .	-3.3847
The rescue forces mount a cooled corpse from the house .	-2.9297
Rescue forces have found a cooled body in a three-family house in a fire in helmet law .	-9.9099
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a spokesman of the Bayreuth police said .	-2.9231
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.0337
When the fire came down , the flames were already smelling from a window .	-3.4746
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room .	-2.7015
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.5900
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.4429
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to explain .	-3.1358
The building was not inhabitable anymore .	-4.2983
The precise cause of the fire was not clear at first .	-1.7694
Germany ’ s largest country church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor .	-2.4623
Background is a possible lack of parish : the Gospel Lutheran Church of Hanover expects the number of currently approximately 1,800 pastors and pastors to be halved by 2030 .	-5.7525
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in talks with the Gospel Press Service .	-4.4532
It is appealing to be able to determine the workflow and the day process .	-4.7003
With Burfia , the National Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor to inspire young people for theological studies .	-5.0601
Currently , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology . .	-3.1766
Burfia is leading this back to the process of de-church : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.4867
The work is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.9101
I am the Commissioner for my calendar and can place my priorities where it is important for me .	-4.4885
As a sourcing career , pastors could be close to the people .	-4.8325
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.0699
To be sure , the free economy pays more , but theologians would have a secure employer for that .	-2.5636
This is something for today ’ s young people , who are not just a career but a meaningful job .	-4.7313
According to the church of Lower Saxony , about 60 pastors are now retired each year .	-3.0015
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theological studio begin their Vikariat .	-2.6983
In sparsely populated areas such as Harz , Emsland , or Wendland , it will be hard to occupy jobs in future .	-3.9373
Burfia , among other things , wants to organise days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-8.0478
Theological studies offer broad education .	-3.1926
One can even become Federal President .	-2.5084
Land Rover Rally Series announced today	-2.1067
The interior features race seats and six-point belt as well as an outdoor speaker .	-4.7234
The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with support for Bowler workshops and logistical support to vehicle insurance between events .	-4.4338
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.9065
They are not all experienced racer drivers , but people looking for tension and adventure as well as an affordable way to world class events .	-8.1376
We are delighted to be able to open this path to partnership with Land Rover and the MSA , and we believe that the format will open up new possibilities for experiencing the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and prepare new people for the straps and the reality of Rally Raid .	-5.8265
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Car – this will be an entertaining championship .	-3.7671
In addition , the Defender Challenge has a training and testing day in February , as well as the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.7563
Called fire to save a trough , which was 15 meters above the ground in a dangerous spur of rock in a fracture of stone .	-7.0845
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was davong after a smaller road accident .	-3.0455
Three days later , she was discovered by a walkers in a stone break in her unfortunate location by . . and . . , , , , , , , and , , , , ,	-8.4096
Fire fighters were on the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death .	-3.3024
The fire was able to bring about a hindsight that saw on a 15-meter lead in a rock wall .	-6.5469
The nine months old cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby had gone away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before it was saved from a stone break on Wednesday .	-4.7710
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 to whom the dog belongs , came to a quarry of flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-4.2485
They had desperately looked for their missing bitch , and had published help on social networks when , after a small road accident , they had expired to a quarry .	-6.5115
About 14 : 15 p.m. on Wednesday a walkers running their dog saw the stranded ruby at the 15 meter high paragraph in stone fraction .	-5.6134
The Cleckheaton Fire Station ’ s technical rescue team ran for the rescue of Ruby , which was transported up in a dog box .	-5.5186
Andy Clayton , a specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.3891
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-2.5882
She did not move muscles during her rescue – she was like stage-frozen .	-2.3063
But now it is doing well .	-1.8592
She then dressed a couple of dog cakes .	-2.8925
This was a rather unusual effort .	-1.8628
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.2738
Peter Lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge gap . ”	-6.0213
They could have been very difficult to injure or worse .	-2.7372
Ruby was brought to the veterinary examination , but he did not notice anything except exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.0042
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ When rescuing , it was frightening . ”	-2.9546
I could not even believe that it really was there above .	-3.3218
It was wonderful to keep them in the poor .	-1.5211
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too big and had collapsed it would probably have crashed .	-3.8113
Fire fighters have done great things .	-1.4805
It was really courageous what they did .	-1.9114
We are just so grateful and every one of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.7762
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that she would fall down , but she remained above . ”	-2.6995
The fire fighters were great .	-1.1579
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.5597
Mick Jagger explains that he never worried Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-3.6022
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a background singer to Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habites Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-4.1319
Perry explained that she had eaten with the aldryer at night , and that “ he hadn ’ t been charged me when I was 18 . ”	-5.5213
She added : “ That has long been , and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.5153
In a statement , a representative hunger , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he ever attempted to approach Katy Perry . ”	-3.9505
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-1.9604
Perry was one of the singers who enjoyed a visit to the Rolling Stones tour this year .	-3.5659
Her new album “ Prism ” landed on Anhieb in place 1 this week .	-4.6356
George Kerevan : European Unbundling gives the Scots the choice .	-1.6381
A new day , a new history of terror to independence .	-1.6116
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-1.9859
This gives the key word for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border forged with barbed wire along the Hadrian wall .	-4.9768
In fact , the Strathclyde proposal highlighted the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe , but , expectedly , this did not play a role in the headlines .	-5.1835
Nor did anyone mention that EU member states often cope with their strict rules when it is cheaper for them .	-4.2217
As Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area , continuing non-observation for Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Scots .	-4.8692
So there is no story here .	-3.0421
And one that has already arrived in the years that it is like a fossil : the first time I heard the " independence means passport controls " -duce at least 40 years ago .	-5.4400
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient story .	-2.7412
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance according to the European pipe ?	-2.4316
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels , particularly now ?	-10.3312
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan for uniting Europe has come to a halt .	-2.8351
The Euro crisis officially killed the project Europe .	-2.9366
Parties across the EU are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro out of the common currency .	-4.0830
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party was able to obtain an alternative for Germany – only founded this year – just under five million votes in the federal election in September , thereby effectively driving Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the parliament .	-5.7879
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-1.7356
But the current economic crisis is turning out to be a turning point .	-2.3185
Because of the tough austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straightjacket in which the national economy is required by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.1015
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – that was only the case in Greece .	-2.1840
Instead , the Eurosystem has stipulated its members ’ exchange rates , which are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so .	-3.8297
Without the possibility of depreciation of the local currency , southern Europe is reintroduced with a built-in productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany .	-4.3300
The only way is to reduce wages and public spending – stimulated by Berlin .	-2.4939
Behind the current problems of Etat and currency there is a deeper European productivity problem .	-3.6008
As a result of Brussels ’ “ green ” energy directives – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and gas compared with the United States .	-3.4937
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-6.3507
All the world ’ s wage collections do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale-gas .	-3.7904
As a result , revolts are emerging , especially in France , the EU ’ s former chief leader .	-3.0268
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that could hold Germany in check and lift Paris on an eye with Washington .	-3.5891
But Berlin no longer needs a gate to political legitimacy , and Europe has pushed its own economic policy , which is to struggle with the struggling French economy .	-4.4843
As a result , Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU front , National Front , has just won a decisive re-election , and thus pointed out to three governing socialists .	-5.1478
The National Front is now France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that division on the right would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-3.4228
What does Le Pen do with their newly won popularity among the French white of the working class ?	-3.5227
It wants to use next year ’ s EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.1240
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is a good thing – such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time .	-3.4308
That is the point I want to stress : in the not-too-distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-3.3810
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something like the “ Europe of sovereign nations , ” favored by General de Gaulle .	-6.6686
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.3090
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering into the US .	-3.3908
But Washington ’ s growing Pacific interest suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone .	-1.7723
Where is Scotland left with all this ?	-2.4707
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-3.0409
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide where .	-2.3300
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a more relaxed European association if we retain our own currency .	-4.2899
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.3264
Otherwise , we should consider equating Norway and retaining our economic independence .	-2.2764
The SNP government in Scotland is , remarkably , the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and proposed ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib dem coalition had to blame .	-4.5133
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only to have austerity imposed on Berlin and Brussels .	-3.3199
Early puberty : Growing up faster	-1.4004
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white ancestors , as investigations show .	-3.5598
Physical changes do not mean immediate puberty .	-1.9830
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible for ensuring that hormones or chemicals are responsible for or for chemicals .	-3.3748
Experts believe that the epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .	-1.2312
The early puberty trend is less marked by boys .	-2.1385
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-3.0845
Should a mother be worried if their daughter grows already at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and shame ?	-3.6972
At the annual conference of the Children ’ s Association American Academy of Pediatrics in Orlando , Florida this week , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-3.6658
“ I spend a lot of time calming parents – normally this is no indication that the puberty is now rapidly coming , ” Kaplowitz .	-6.1353
Obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axis hair , as well as body smell , are shown in girls earlier .	-4.6635
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of menarchs ( appearance of first ruling blood ) in the last 40 years .	-5.2517
In the United States , the average age age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.2519
“ When the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to menarche , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early Puberty of Girls : the essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-4.8620
Time is the most precise test of how puberty proceeds .	-2.0083
Disputes are what really marks the start of puberty , but it is “ early ” when the increase in breast is accompanied by a boost of growth before an age of eight .	-5.6517
In most cases , the process or stagnates – something that a paediatrician can carefully monitor .	-2.1413
For faster advances , tests could be displayed by an endicronologist to avoid serious problems like tumors or cysts .	-4.9388
There are methods of treatment to delay early menstruation and to defend another consequence : the premature ageing of bones , which can ultimately lead to growth emanation and thus a small body growth in adults .	-6.9894
The recommendations for a medical or hormonal therapy are based on child age , development speed , growth rate and emotional maturity .	-3.6221
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-0.8731
Kaplowitz is reluctant in terms of medicines , but he acknowledges : “ The repression of puberty can mitigate behavior problems and feelings of girls , unlike their agents . ”	-5.1417
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.7917
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side , ” Kaplowitz said .	-2.4662
“ It was a shock , ” a woman reminds her daughter with ten days .	-2.5313
Although there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was emotionally not prepared .	-2.5032
She was frightened and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friend circle .	-2.5728
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.6164
But there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media would be robust .	-3.7071
Boys , like girls , get puberty sooner .	-2.4070
Kaplowitz considers that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.2270
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years , which establishes a connection between grain perfection and entry into puberty .	-4.6471
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-1.7368
In that country , African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white ancestors .	-2.7440
There are different explanations for this .	-0.9939
Global puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-3.3558
Another puzzle : Although boys already grow facial and shame hair , the trend toward a full earlier puberty is not as strong as girls .	-4.4260
Other doctors at the AAAP conference emphasized the complexity of the issue .	-2.0435
The emergence of acne and shame is even widespread among babies and infants .	-3.4077
“ We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children ’ s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.1574
Parents should not hesitate to ask their paediatrician how to talk to her child .	-2.7314
“ This may mean that you have to talk sooner than expected , ” Kaplowitz said .	-3.7609
If you stay calm , the child normally reacts well .	-3.3714
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it previously speaks out .	-4.2354
Jumbo manufacturers are competing in the face of large orders over seat width .	-3.8464
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a debate about the width of seats in the tourist class on long haul flights , which indicates the tone for a bitter collapse at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.5098
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those on which airlines strive most , but this displayed space is the key to the efficiency claims of the newest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-6.0949
Airbus called this week for an industry standard that prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says this is what airlines should decide .	-4.5771
The debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-range flights and expect record claims from 17 to 21 November .	-4.6920
As the rear part of the aircraft has been fixed – especially if there are ranks of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the given economic results that the new " mini jumbo " design is supposed to deliver .	-5.7954
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 777X ” comprises 406 people in the tourist class who are more than 17 inches wide , allowing ten per series .	-5.4635
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per series .	-3.6849
Aircraft giants often share engines of technical details by advertising in the specialist press .	-3.2320
Airbus now appeals to the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to make the race directly to the public with over 100 orders .	-3.5574
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing donors a picture where three people sit together in a restaurant , entitled “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.7929
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus Shipyard John Leahy .	-3.7052
With changing nutritional habits , people are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.7716
Between the early 1970 ’ s , when Boeing defined modern long-range travel , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 % , according to the US Department of Health .	-4.5816
The tail size of the male American average in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm , according to US health statistics .	-3.7335
Airbus says that his rival sticks to a 1950s seat concept , when the average body size of the newly battered “ jet set ” was narrower .	-5.2012
Research has been carried out , Airbus has shown that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat will increase the quality of the sleep by 53 percent . .	-10.7688
Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus to its seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines strike the balance between flight tariffs and equipment .	-4.5518
The company also explains that , according to studies , the aircraft experience depends on more than the width of seats .	-3.9884
“ It really goes to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” the flight cabin expert Kent Craver from Boeing explains .	-4.3906
They do not want us to dictate what makes them profitable .	-1.1928
They know their business better than anyone .	-1.6631
For passengers it is a question of greater freedom of arc , but for producers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can have an impact on sales .	-5.7825
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after listing prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-3.8373
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets .	-5.8323
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat for their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 777-300ER .	-7.4255
The statements on the results depend partly on the 777X compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 7777 .	-8.6446
The increased costs per unit are still lower than the currently used ten seats per series .	-3.5286
“ Boeing therefore quotes more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-3.0769
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per series of existing 777s indicated that many passengers chose the closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper flight tariffs .	-8.3508
“ Eighteen customs seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is managed by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert on cabin installation , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.2664
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but also a supplier catalogue that allows airlines to select from .	-3.8412
The world 's travelling jet sellers even carry with themselves to measure the facility at the competition .	-5.7274
Even if they price the comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with a sophisticated finish for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.2581
Airbus offers a ten-seat A350 , but , according to its own statement , has not yet sold .	-4.3528
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of more cabin adaptability and offered broad seats in its corridors for some jets .	-4.1071
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard will probably be poisoned , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.2319
New antinicotine vaccine could make the garage for smoking fun .	-4.1590
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil smoking .	-2.0239
The only dose of the vaccine could protect mice for a lifetime from nicotine sugar .	-3.2153
Before testing people , further experiments are needed , which may take some years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of New York 's Cornell Medical College said that the first results were good .	-4.6564
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help even millions of smokers who have tried to stop testing all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine seek is stronger than those approaches , ” said Cornell .	-4.7834
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been modified to include genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-2.9974
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .	-2.3503
The antibodies hunt the nicotin molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain , leaving smokers with no nicotine high .	-3.0173
In experiments , vaccinated mice that has been administered by nicotine retained its normal level of activity .	-2.6387
Missing without vaccination would have taken a “ waste ” , researchers said , a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain .	-4.3163
The experiments are described in the specialist sheet Science Translational Medici.	-2.7821
Previously tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.6281
The vaccination had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-2.9137
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.9708
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it were quite safe , could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine seeking .	-4.4715
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-1.7417
“ You know , when they start smoking again , they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to lay off the habit , ” he explains .	-4.4893
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.2841
Tripodi disputes having been influenced by Obeid .	-1.5551
The former Labor Party Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales initiates an investigation by state corruption supervision .	-4.3837
Former NSW minister disputes having changed maritime pattern rules on request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden involvement in three land under state-controlled control . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.9124
The Independent Commission for Corruption ( ICAC Independent Commission for Corruption ) extended its investigations on Friday on whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to prolong leasing contracts at Circular Quay , where Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without a tender on their expiry in August 2005 .	-6.6779
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi knew of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land , after Tripodi ’ s former deputy chief , Lynne Ashpole , said accordingly on Thursday .	-5.1784
In many years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had been pushing for public tenders for leasing contracts .	-4.0405
The designers were opposed to this and wanted longer running times .	-4.7053
In 2009 , the Circular Quay leasing contracts for companies that contributed $ 2.5 million a year were extended without public tender .	-4.0334
Tripodi , who was minister of port from February 2006 to November 2009 , was originally in favour of public tenders .	-3.7495
But he disputed the changes to Obeid ’ s requests , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganisation of government leasing rules .	-5.7740
One of the ICAC ’ s telephony directories showed in August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who was elected to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-4.8429
“ Was the issue raised in these telephone talks the drafting of commercial packaging rules ? ” , Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whey Tripodi asked .	-5.3832
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.2719
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-1.8373
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-1.7720
Israeli combat aircraft are attacking Syria ’ s target , such official sources of re.	-4.6810
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked Thursday Stagnacht a goal at the Syrian port of Latakia , a senior government official confirmed Fox News .	-3.7806
The official did not explain what the goal was , but said that it was at least one .	-2.2641
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.6536
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile supplies in Syria .	-2.3372
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ authenticity test ” .	-2.6046
The government is considering extended measures on a “ real test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-3.8230
If the test was introduced , it would be used by a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to occupy unqualified jobs , or as a backdoor for family and friends to Australia .	-5.0354
Today , a proposal for discussion by the government was published , after former Labor MEPs , Maxine McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be interpreted as insult by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.3031
“ Volume explanations like foreigners are supposed to hide behind and , Australians first “ are a very unpleasant reversal in times when unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she said to Australia India Institute today .	-6.2860
Historically , it said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region deny an echo of this historical artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.1355
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures , once thought by former Minister for Immigration Chris Bowen .	-3.3730
Immigration Secretary Brendan O 'Connor , who held talks yesterday about smuggling in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and others are still considering .	-4.5143
If the “ real-world criterion ” is adopted , then someone who requests a visa might be checked to see whether “ the application is real in the cases where the applicant relates or is personally associated with the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-6.1919
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , hundreds of companies seeking to support firstly a small number of workers have finally stopped .	-5.1663
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum died at a heart attack after arriving this week with a Christmas refugee boot .	-4.0313
The discovered nine-year son of the man , who came to Australia with him , is supported by an adult cousin , who was also on the boat since his father 's death on Wednesday .	-4.5936
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .	-1.6285
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.3315
The work of HS2 Ltd suggests that high speed connections between Scotland and north of England should be established as early as Phase 1 in 2026 .	-4.5404
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.1078
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.8767
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed train link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.6740
After Phase 2 , connections will be made to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.4812
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-2.4577
The British Government , in talks with Transport Scotland , has charged HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-3.8932
This includes the possibility of a journey time from the end of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-9.4692
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network of routes that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.6405
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.0447
Without it we are facing a crisis of capacity on our railway network .	-2.3603
The connection between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , is also at stake .	-3.0615
As Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.2793
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocally ” the Scottish inclusion in the HS2 network .	-3.8571
Brown said , “ The high-speed train has the potential for enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but Scotland ’ s economy also provides an argument for fast rail connections across the UK . ”	-4.2234
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for everyone and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-4.8522
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and to adopting the next steps together .	-4.0344
Regulations relating to electronic equipment in aircraft are temporarily in force in Australia .	-2.6342
Australian passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones at start and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease the regulations of this type of equipment .	-4.3108
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their requirements , so that passengers can read , view , or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases , if they are in “ flight mode ” .	-4.8430
During the majority of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do this , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-4.1659
Australian companies observe the decision to implement which US airlines have to do vast amounts of work , but do not pursue any immediate plans to amend their rules .	-10.9233
The CASA Aviation Safety Authority also declared that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply .	-10.0803
“ At the moment CASA has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft ” .	-4.1867
The issue is subject to provisions whereby airlines must always maintain safety and follow the safety instructions provided by cabin crew .	-4.4995
Virgin has already engaged in discussions on the extension of its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and has stated that they are open to change , but they must be initiated by the legislator .	-4.4295
“ We would welcome a CASA review of the approval of electronic equipment , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.2188
Qantas declared that it will remain with the current rules until further notice .	-4.1823
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic equipment should not be used when starting and landing , and we currently have no plans to change , ” said the company .	-4.2214
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.5250
However , we are always interested in developments on regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.9655
The decision differs in US societies depending on the age of the fleet .	-2.8719
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders by mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , handbaggage programs , and customer instruction .	-3.9434
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it is able to pass passengers on the use of portable , lighter electronic devices such as tablets , e-books readers and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-5.4346
In rare cases of bad vision , the crew will indicate passengers while landing will disable the devices .	-4.0744
The group also recommended that heavier devices be dust under the seat or field at the start and landing safely .	-4.9495
Before the Reforderby against Schalke had provided with beloved BVB trailers for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-5.7675
Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced tough consequences .	-1.5524
Before the Friday game of the Football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras responded with a silence - firstly .	-2.8193
It was an undisturbed acoustic , almost impossible , which offered the observer the chance to play the federal league between the German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart at the Signal Iduna Park .	-6.6636
Most of the guests listened to their songs .	-3.7636
The southern gallery , where the faithful - and loudest - fans of BVB fans , first presented themselves with an exceptional silence : no songs , no battle cries .	-6.0319
The podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinated common firing , remained unseated .	-4.2331
And at the forefront of the gallery , a big flag with the " Section Stadium Ban " footprint was awarded .	-7.1830
As a goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player entered the place , short papers branded .	-6.9571
When his team colleagues followed , there were loud songs and arousing shapes - but not anywhere .	-4.9415
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern galleries there was nothing .	-2.2871
Norbert Dickel also reported the positive experiences of recent days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , contract extension of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not create a celebration .	-5.5905
Only five minutes before the attack , the Capo granded his podium - and the tangible tension by then was removed in a noisy cry , when thickness , as usual , asked the mood to the ranks of the stadium .	-8.5220
The last thing was as always the southern gallery - and finally it was once again the most noisy place in the stadium .	-5.6362
And , at the latest , when an attack from the southern gallery made a loud appeal , " Derbysians stands on " , everything was as always .	-7.1761
The silence before that was probably a reaction to what happened in recent days .	-7.3172
Just before Reforderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the more attended BVB trailers had driven light missiles into the spectator ranges and were fired on the square , taking almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller .	-8.5992
The game was attacked late because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.3290
BVB boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tips of the Dortmunder Ultras thereafter in his office - and believe Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable date for fan representatives .	-4.4675
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " said the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.7313
As an immediate measure , Watzke promised the Ultras a choreography for home play against the VfB Stuttgart .	-3.0242
" I forbid this , " he said .	-2.7554
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.8428
In addition , the Ultras have shown various ways of punishing them - until Tuesday they now have time to choose for one .	-4.6108
Otherwise , Watzke , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.4371
" This becomes cutting " , insured Watzke .	-2.2472
We must be keen to see the reactions in the southern gallery .	-3.7516
Pfandhouses boom in Singapore as the middle class crisis has arrived .	-2.7503
Janani Amirthalinga exchange a golden arm reef , ring and a pair of earrings to pay their daughters ’ school fees in a deposit at Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore .	-10.7933
“ My husband and I have just bought a house because my whole money is inside , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.1003
Although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( approximately $ 1,730 ) as an administrative worker , and also work for their husband , do not spend the monthly family income , explains them .	-5.7493
Indeed , demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is growing – is so great that ValueMax , where she has exchanged , became the third deposit house on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-4.5199
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as uncertain bank loans .	-3.8350
Typically , Pfandhäuser in Singapore demands an effective 17 % annual interest rate , which is only just over 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch at the same shopping centre .	-4.8902
Pfandhäuser , however , offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of credit rating or income proof , which is why loans are faster than possible with banks . to the to and .	-11.1127
That is why millions of people in the region turn to Pfandhäuser after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-3.5653
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit because of loose fiscal policies in advanced economies , families with lower and middle-income incomes seek Pfandhäuser to compensate for the difference in stalling economies .	-4.9499
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing budget debt , mainly through rising mortgages , described as a risk factor for Asian banks ’ credit ratings .	-2.5689
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the Agency ’ s assessment , have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-3.0466
Malaysia , with 80 % of GDP at the top of the list , is rising 60 % still in 2008 .	-2.9422
Economists are also worried about Thailand ’ s high consumer debt , which has just emerged from a technical recession this week .	-2.8066
On Thursday , the data revealed a continuing export weakness and a lowering of consumer demand .	-3.7312
“ In the end , with rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their incomes wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Win , an economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.1205
Historical highlights in gold prices over the last two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items , as people take the opportunity to transform family jewellery into cash .	-4.5290
In Singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged objects are in the 200 deposits of the city ’ s state of gold .	-3.8197
People say , “ The price of gold looks good , let us pledge large mothers of gold and bring back next month . ”	-3.5573
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % increase in its branches in recent months .	-2.9867
Growth in panel business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the branches in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , said Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.3007
The company finances that with 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars that grew this week with the Singapore stock .	-3.5486
While some lenders have fallen into the crossfire for high interest rates , Yeah explains that Pfandhäuser not only killed cheaper rates than other lenders , but also did not directly raise debt .	-5.1066
“ Customers make items they already own , and the liquidation of personal values does not expand household debt , ” explains them .	-4.1078
Pfand-bond business is increasingly accepted as short-term , secure financing .	-4.3976
Nor are all people who use a deposit in financial difficulties .	-3.9327

Rescue package over 325 million Australian dollars to Tasmanian health care	-3.4788
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with the bailout of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste money .	-4.5718
Federal Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will adopt “ immediate measures ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.5498
Four years after government consultations with independent Tasmanian MEP Andrew Wilkie decided to fund the financing .	-4.4382
“ The government has launched an emergency bailout package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the state of the state , ” Plibersek has today stated .	-4.0187
The $ 325-million package provides emergency assistance to electoral performance of $ 31 million .	-3.2501
A further 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments for grey star , are designed to eliminate residues .	-3.3028
There is also money for day-to-day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better over-care after staying at a stationary level , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-5.1079
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that my clinical staff affected me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” Tanya Plibersek said .	-3.9047
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasmanian Government .	-2.4135
The state must retain the current level of funding in order to receive money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where extra money has been spent .	-4.2173
A three-person Commission will be set up and will ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.4668
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by genuine reforms that would put the public Tasmanian health system on a more sustainable path . ”	-3.7442
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent aid , which he expressed first to the Prime Minister in early May .	-3.2796
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to getting the state ’ s public health system from the worry list , ” said Wilkie .	-3.8515
According to the state ’ s government , these electoral benefits will largely make up for recent cuts .	-3.7927
But the public health spokesman of the opposition at the federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ straw ” .	-4.3056
“ We are in the current situation , because the Labor government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said vis-à-vis ABC TV .	-3.8623
It cannot be that a government is running nearly half a billion dollars out of the system , holding 300 million in Commonwealth and doing as if the good news is .	-5.6046
Dutton called for Plibersek to guarantee that no single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-7.0230

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such a monitoring group .	-2.5723
Syria has destroyed important institutions for the manufacture of chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition , explained the global surveillance group for chemical weapons on Thursday , while in the north of the country there have been serious clashes close to one of the locations where allegedly toxic substances are being stored .	-6.1304
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed as soon as three years ago since the start of the civil war .	-3.0978
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline at .	-3.0800
November 1 , which was set up by the organization Damascus , based in The Hague , to destroy or “ inoperate ” all the facilities for the production of chemical weapons , including all machines for mixing chemicals into poisonous gas and filling ammunition .	-5.7872
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.0354
The destruction of institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.2241
However , Damascus must begin to destroy the existing weapons and stocks .	-2.9300
According to assumptions , there are approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including the Sarin nerve gas .	-3.0075
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira on Thursday , experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses as announced by the Syrian observatory based in the United Kingdom .	-4.6461
The activist group that persecuted the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria declared on Thursday that 120.296 people died .	-3.2630
Of these , there are 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-2.0015
On the side of the government , 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad ’ s army , 18,678 were pro-government fighters , and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.0977
Also among the dead are 2,202 army soldiers destroyed and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.6975
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011 .	-1.7131
This number has not been updated so far .	-6.1158
The conflict has forced two million people to escape from the country .	-1.8174
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting against the rebels for weeks in Safira , many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.7132
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not call details .	-2.5772
The struggles underscore the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arms arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a deadly civil war .	-8.2844
According to the OPCW , which cooperates closely with the United Nations , the team “ now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria , and has witnessed its destruction . ”	-4.6739
Therefore , “ no more inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-2.5095
At the beginning of the week , the inspectors had stated that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of the 23 sites given by Damascus .	-3.6234
The inspectors said because of security concerns , the visit to two facilities was not possible .	-4.0033
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites were “ abandoned , according to Syrian statements , ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme had been moved to other stated institutions that were inspected . ”	-4.6143
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-3.1113
Syria has submitted a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month .	-2.6934
“ I prefer the hat before the brave and the courage you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever undertaken by this organisation , ” Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organization , declared in a comment published by OPCW .	-4.9982

As for further developments , Rami Abdurahman said , on Wednesday , that there was a strong explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-4.0484
The cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .	-2.1085
Anger about Bali bombing	-2.3758
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted to the judgment of the last of the incipients to be tried , as Umar Patek , in her view , should be shot by firm law .	-6.8246
Patek , who was in the escape of almost ten years as one of South-East Asia ’ s most sought people , was condemned yesterday for his role in building bombing bombs as a sentence of 20 years .	-6.0716
He could be made redundant after 15 years with criminal law .	-3.0843
The 45-year-old mass murder was found guilty of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many more were injured .	-3.5180
A claim was also made by a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on sanctuary in 2000 .	-4.3119
The Public Prosecutor had demanded a lifetime sentence , even if it was called for the man , who , due to his reputation as master bomber builder , was also called for the ‘ Demolion Man ’ that could have applied for the death penalty .	-6.6648
The decision has raised painful memories of June Corteen , a mother from Perth , who has lost her 39 years of twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his fellow conspirators nearly ten years ago .	-4.0356
With tears fighting , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.8256
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-1.9929
“ You should put him before a firing command , ” said Corteen against AAAP .	-3.5780
I must live with it every day that I will not get another grandson and I will never see my daughters any.	-3.4473

Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives .	-2.8059
He died three times after the attack on a lifestyle system for a month .	-3.9514
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell , Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-2.8744
Indeed , this type should have the death penalty above all else .	-3.3470
Let him live – no , there is no reason to leave him alive .	-3.0582
Twenty years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds of injured is not much .	-5.5865
Patek is the last of the Bali bombers in court .	-2.4073
He escaped almost a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottbad in January 2011 , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later .	-4.0973
During the negotiation , a FBI agent said that secret services reports had pointed out that Patek was in Pakistan to meet with bin Laden in order to rebuild the link between South East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-4.5057
“ He did not face , ” said Corteen .	-2.0157
Until recently , he did not reveal how much sorrow he caused to other people .	-3.0271
The judgment came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , celebrating memorial ceremonies in Bali and Australia .	-2.8952
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.2368
Patek may still appeal against his verdict .	-1.2755
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not have mobile calls ) .	-3.1055
Air passengers can now listen to their electronic devices from departure to landing for reading , work , games , music and use the image of films but not by telephone , such as the new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-5.6826
However , passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.8675
The FAA employees Michael Huerta declared their implementation at a press conference .	-4.3447
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and have updated the training manuals of the aircraft personnel and the arrangements for dust of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-4.8071
The FAA declared that it had already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.2324
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines .	-2.0597
“ Depending on the plan ’ s condition , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a announstatement .	-4.0211
Currently , passengers must switch off smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.2216
You may only restart it once the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain has green light .	-4.8367
When you enter the landing flight , passengers must disable it and not restart it until the aircraft has passed .	-5.3695
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft were protected from electronic disruptions may allow their passengers to use the devices also at start-up , landing and rolling , the FAA declared .	-6.2283
Most of the new transport aircraft and other aircraft converted to larger levels for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.2997
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Association of Carriers , welcomed the changes .	-3.4942
“ If the new regulation is implemented safely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented gladings .	-4.0992
To be honest , we 're sorry to have to feel like watchdogs on this subject .	-6.4475
However , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging e-mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .	-4.2979
Passengers are invited to place smartphones , tablets and other aircraft .	-3.2013
So , no “ Words With Friends , ” the Scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines because he refused to disable the device while the aircraft was parked on the flight .	-5.3855
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stamped , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-4.6155
Calls on cell phone during the flight also remain prohibited .	-3.2656
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.2190
FAA may lift the ban on certain electronic equipment on startup and landing .	-2.5703
Last month , Mark Rosenker told the National Transportation Safety Board that security experts on national transport issues on CBS news , mobile phones are still viewed as risk .	-3.8381
“ Mobile is really a problem , not only because it could potentially cause disruptions in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disturb the transmission of the transmission from the transmission , ” says Rosenker .	-5.2337
Last month , an industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended that the government permit a broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.8660
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease its use restrictions .	-2.8050
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid grounds for prohibition .	-2.9839
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to apply , because the use of equipment has become pervasive .	-4.0001
Some studies refer to the fact that up to one third of passengers forget the dismantling of the device .	-3.9868
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers , after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment had become known by passengers with state-of-the-art UKW radios .	-4.7900
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed and approved by the FAA that they do not represent any electronic interference .	-8.8574
For some years flights passengers have been using Wi-Fi for flights .	-6.0882
The flights customized to Wi-Fi systems are also less sensitive to interferences .	-3.9061
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , Huerta said .	-2.9808
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally produces much less radiation than previous generations .	-2.9591
E-readers , for example , only give minimal radiation when smashed .	-3.8783
But when downloading or sending data , transmission values are stronger .	-2.0042
Amazon.com. advocates relaxing the restrictions on device use by passengers .	-3.6274
In 2011 , corporate workers fled a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not identify .	-4.6523
Members of the FAA Consulting Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-2.5690
Douglas Kidd , by the National Association of Airline Passengers , said that he believes that the disruption of equipment is genuine , even if the risk is minimal .	-4.2997
Other committees have said that there are only some very rare reports of pilots who are talking about the disruption of aircraft systems by the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-5.8558
The Committee recommended , however , that the FAA should allow pilots to order the dismantling of the devices by passengers in case of instrument landing under poor conditions .	-5.9226
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adaptation for travellers who would now be fully equipped with technology .	-4.1254
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.6197
Once again , the air rescue service from North Sea Bohrinsel releases rescued birds .	-4.1676
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , which had been exhausted on a North Sea drilling island , was replaced to nature .	-5.4004
The water rally was flown with a helicopter to Aberdeen last month , where it was lumped by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its Alloa rescue centre .	-4.5116
Colin Seddon , head of the centre , said : “ This waterrall was probably a winter migratory bird from Northern Europe , held by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-4.6486
Apparently , the exhausted bird was seeking refuge on the drill island .	-2.7120
He added : “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-4.2117
It was once again fit and healthy when releasing it .	-2.8602
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.4397
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU .	-7.4953
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-3.1922
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 executives from the economy , who illustrate the UK ’ s size , sectors , and regions .	-4.9399
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.5346
We found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and concentrating on countries that modernise and grow while the EU Member States are stagnating .	-3.8727
They want new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil to be favored by the government side , rather than the long and exhaustive process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.9825
In their view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be retracted to Westminster .	-3.5421
There was widespread discontent about the internal market , because , according to companies , the cost of Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed with that which is traditionally the most pro-European .	-5.0077
Finally , and this probably says most , our survey of economic leaders revealed that a strong majority of Britain wants a course to change the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade .	-4.6242
This recognition among companies of all sizes and leading corporations shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change , ” which will bring the action back to the UK .	-4.6845
Much is at stake – changing the agreement and improving conditions for Britain would lead to a referendum at 16 % to a change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU .	-4.0341
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of British membership conditions .	-3.1420
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power from renegotiation to Britain .	-2.1029
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.5308
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our survey shows , which is a greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.7680
Pipeline in Bulgaria is the beginning of a new Gazprom Gazprom Alexei Miller .	-3.2678
The construction of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects , declared the Gazprom Board .	-3.3517
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction of the Bulgarian section of the South-Stream gas pipeline , the biggest and most important project in Europe , started , ” said the Chairman of the Executive Board of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a decon Thursday .	-7.1958
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.9956
South Stream is intended to increase diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.0353
A contract dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe , ensures that there is a higher risk of conventional routes , as is official .	-4.5794
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ switched off forever . ”	-2.9759
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the entire project starts in 2015 .	-6.2604
According to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries will start on the planned route to the end of the year .	-3.3844
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-1.6889

Concerning the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused of accusations against Jonathan Lord for sex offences .	-4.7253
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been charged with children for sexual delicacies before 2011 charges against child care Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were made , as the Royal Commission had for child sexual abuse .	-5.2263
But , at the Commission ’ s opening declaration , the YMCA stated that ‘ never had to deal with an incident of sexual abuse of children ’ .	-5.2519
Managing Director Phillip Hare has been consulted about one case in which a YMCA employee was accused of abuse of child pornography , and another where a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been sentenced to him for abuse of familiar children .	-5.3870
Hare said to Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case but did not recognize the second .	-3.3223
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “ there were external YMCA checks in which the YMCA was recognised as the front front front front front front in child safety . ”	-5.5660
Instead , evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Education Ministry ) in August of the year .	-3.8262
Hare , who began with the YMCA 21 , acknowledged that the Management Board “ failed “ from me to downward ” to stop Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report infringements of children ’ s safety directives .	-6.4028
Lord was sentenced to the YMCA at the beginning of the year for sexual offences at 12 boys during his two-year activity .	-3.9858
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.0991
But Hare disputed that YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lords of infringements of children ’ s safety .	-3.8731
Employees said they had observed infringements , including that Lord was with children alone , who maintained them privately as baby sitters , left them sitting on his lap , saying that he loved it , and let children play with his mobile .	-6.5099
Danielle Ockwell , who was the leader of the Lord , and who asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service manager Jacqui Barnat , who was the supervisor of Lords in the YMCA Caringbah , “ was very intimidating and most of the time was very impossible . ”	-6.8246
The Managing Director declared that he would not accept statements from employees that they had not taken the trouble to reimburse their superior message .	-12.4893
Instead , he said , her friendship affected Lord her judgment , which is why she would not have reported .	-3.5710
Hare declared that he shared his view with the Executive Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” was “ not about reporting ” by employees , and the Board approved it .	-6.1036
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations soon after the allegations had been made by the Managing Director of the Child Services of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-4.0032
He said that this should prevent the evidence from being contaminated , but that was “ over-heated ” and poorly implemented .	-7.2995
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children at the time Jonathan Lord was working there between 2009 and 2011 , said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert on sexual abuse , the Commission .	-4.1497
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in attitude , review , deployment , training , and supervision of employees .	-7.5261
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.8365
Tony Blair explained that he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-2.8401
In an interview this evening at the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59 year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.2268
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade of leader , Blair has largely avoided expressing itself in British politics , and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as envoy of the quartet of the Middle East Peace Founders .	-4.7761
As to whether he would like to return to the premier ’ s office , Blair was quoted in the words by Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that will happen , so ... ”	-4.6859

The indigenous couple , both of them equal , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry .	-5.3097
In his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had put his plate cap in a calm angle , leading the two years old toffee through the ring .	-6.3506
Fenton was praised by the jury for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony , which was well above his age .	-3.6134
And toffee received best-marks for his performance and personality .	-4.1425
Toffee had been given a gift to his third birthday last March and since then , he has been practicing Shetland-Pony every day .	-5.7797
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great gesture . ”	-2.2766
They had to compete against the entire participant field and ran out of place with gold pokal and rosette .	-4.8437
It was only the second time that he had participated in a contest with Toffee , and we were all delighted when he won .	-3.5898
Fully strangers in the arena held him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-2.8883
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows the footsteps of his Tante Sharon Howels , which has been running horses for over ten years .	-3.8487
Howels told : “ The whole audience was like electric and everyone has fired and clattered him . ”	-7.5249
He ran the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-3.9238
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors , and farms and has two chickens to keep in mind .	-3.2060
Just as it has started , it will not take long for it to be on the “ Horse of the Year ” show – and I am sure that it will cut well .	-8.1680
A spokesman of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.0845
Together they are a great team .	-0.6343
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the lead ring .	-3.9277
They care about good collaboration between Pony and Leader – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-3.1037
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has contributed her part to this , which really fit perfectly for the occasion .	-4.0601
The Chinese newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after appeal .	-1.9905
A Chinese newspaper , which on the front page called for the release of a reporter accused of differentiation , should be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-3.9450
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-1.8013
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a partial company .	-2.6375
Now the New Express is subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority has declared .	-5.8643
The " Rectification Order " was issued by the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-2.6757
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had released several incorrect reports about the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-3.9799
“ The New Express ’ s editorial management was unordered , ” the regulator announced in a statement .	-3.2207
She said that he decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting license . ”	-2.7068
Moreover , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant person be identified at the New Express and immediately check the New Express leadership team . ”	-6.2761
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-3.3787
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and set itself behind his journalistic work .	-6.6739
But then Chen appeared in state television and admitted that he published false reports against payment .	-3.6719
“ In this case , I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he said to the state news channel CCTV .	-5.6708
I did it first and foremost because I was at money and glory .	-2.9686
It has become clear to me that I acted wrong .	-2.4003
Following Chen 's apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page and declared that it failed to properly review the reports .	-3.8313
Various familiar suspects have made feelings on television recently .	-5.7427
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced , despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned , to force someone to accuse themselves .	-10.2911
Drogent tunnel discovered by its own railway line between the USA and Mexico	-4.5736
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway operation , has now been discovered .	-3.5269
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres tunnels as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever had found .	-2.9202
The tunnel , which runs in the zickzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.5032
In the area there are countless invisible storage halls , making it easier to hide loaded trucks with drugs .	-4.2966
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized , the authorities declared .	-2.8043
In discovering the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the records of the court .	-3.5949
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged with the ownership and the intended sale of Marijuana and Cocaine .	-2.7166
They are threatened with imprisonment sentences of ten years and lifelong .	-2.9581
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of detergent channels .	-2.4027
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-1.9241
Some of the largest tunnels were discovered in October following the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico , which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of quickly bringing their product to consumers .	-4.5990
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 meters long passage with railways , which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two stores in San Diego .	-5.1517
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still loving Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr .	-1.9016
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.4822
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-1.5137
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year flynn .	-1.3636
Actor Orlando Bloom expressed his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr , to separate him .	-4.3875
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hoped . "	-3.6574
Kerr and he himself still loved , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-2.2878
" We will support each other and love Flynn parents " .	-1.9828
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 her sons Flynn was born .	-2.1306
Veganism , according to Lexica , is different from vegetarianism , but it is quite significant .	-4.1281
Because , while vegetarians permit the consumption of cream , ice or a powerful Edamer , these worms are not on a vegan ’ s menu .	-5.7122
Milk , cheese , egg , beside the waiver of meat and fish , the vegan departs from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied .	-4.7439
One might wonder what remains , but more carefully considering the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable ingenuity .	-5.6265
" Broadbands are very popular , " explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local Reform House , who has a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.7460
Also Reuben Proctor is happy to visit the loading in the Domgasse .	-2.6787
For 13 years , the born New Zealand has lived vegan , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 , I died and became a vegetarian " .	-4.7477
Around the turn of the century then took the next step and I became Veganer .	-2.4867
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of shoe selection , " says Proctor , the art leather prefers normal leather leather .	-4.0321
He recognized that in other day-to-day interests there is no animal product .	-3.9606
Above all , his ethics are vegan .	-2.5173
" I do not want animals to die for me " , Proctor speaks out the maxims of the vegans , which extends to all consumption behaviour .	-4.0283
Instead of burgers , stirring or rubbers falling behind , the vegan quickly discovered new products that enthusiastically increased .	-5.0474
" It is a dual bonus , " says Proctor today , " indeed it is not a waiver of Ascesis , it is an enrichment . " The belief to reduce selection of menu to the power of habit by changing food .	-8.3134
And precisely this condition has also left some such well-meaning attempts to fail . . , .	-7.3053
" The addictor is a decisive factor that allows many to abandon quickly , just like smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-4.0857
And says : " Typical tastes are not fixed at the animal " .	-4.7889
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-2.1422
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " explains Vegans .	-3.1275
For a barbecue festival , Proctor brings with it Auberginen , Champignons and a few vegans .	-5.7111
It respects a balanced , varied diet , where it is supposed to taste it in depth once .	-5.3134
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.2749
" It should taste , but this is not only to reduce animal food , " said Proctor .	-3.0685
He did not suffer health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-2.9995
For me , the conversion had a positive aspect .	-1.7327
I do not take a foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin share .	-2.0622
There are high-performance athletes that eat vegan exclusively .	-2.6142
" My blood values are best , I often check in , " betrays Proctor .	-2.6414
In particular , warning against the lack of Vitamin B12 , many Vegansimus critics .	-3.7729
" As animals are fed with feed instead of grass on pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat buyed in the cooling house , the vitamin B12 proportion is high , " finds Proctor .	-5.8156
For vegans it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-2.8077
" My B12 values are in order " , he explains .	-1.6540
Proctor of food procurement must not go a long way .	-3.5671
After all , there are foodstuffs everywhere and every supermarket now has soyamilch and other products .	-3.3074
Everything I need is localized .	-3.1061
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-1.9635
" Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive , but this is how it is for " ordinary " finished products as well " .	-4.5075
Without it , the preparation of vegan courts would be far more favourable and less time-consuming than commonly thought .	-7.2066
" There is a lot to discover in the kitchen , with a few small knives you can get good if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-3.6781
Margarine instead of butter , a little more backpowder and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with his vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring his swing parents to the sauna .	-6.1369
Family festivals give the vegan a new spirit .	-3.2737
This has dynamism when cooking together , and it has a new significance .	-4.6799
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.3128
But of course he was already skeptical .	-2.6449
Don 't bother you any more ?	-1.5333
" Should I now feel badly because I drink milk ? " - as a vegan with a sense of finger when asking questions like this ?	-5.9336
" I don 't deny the people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be granted an enclave .	-4.1160
And , more precisely , the everyday world seems not as vegan as suspected - and the vegan is not as restricted as commonly thought in everyday life .	-4.6529
Almost Food is also allowed .	-9.0489
Pommes are everywhere !	-2.0158
" Many noble shops offer Falafel , or a vegetarian Yufka " , says Proctor .	-4.1628
In a pizzeria he dishes on pasta dishes , or ordered a pizza without cheese , everything a matter of habit .	-3.6250
Restaurants are so slow to imagine .	-2.4531
" When I began to feed myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult " , the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , draw attention to it " .	-4.7677
" If there are enough enquiries , they may be inclined to supplement the menu " , he hopes .	-2.9442
Vegane restaurants are developing , such as the comebub in Mannheim or the Vogel-free café .	-4.4012
Proctor wants other restaurants to have a vegan food at least on the menu .	-3.3450
Essentially , vegan dishes are there .	-5.5940
Everyone can eat it , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-1.5962
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , for they exclude others , " Proctor states .	-3.6428
" If we want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority of people impossible in the first place , " says Proctor .	-3.1565
But buying vegan products could be somewhat difficult at the outset .	-7.5896
In particular , if one learns to understand that animal additives can also contain in earth nuts as colors , one seems to be brave enough to follow ethics with so many hurdles and traps .	-6.6135
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients , the food and also cleaning agents .	-4.3226
" After and after gradually one develops a scanner view and knows which characters and logos you have to respect " It is sometimes better to do small steps than stole or stumble , " Proctor knows .	-4.5944
Veganism , it is an important moral highlight that beats awareness .	-2.3479
Perhaps he does not quite manage to put his habits in place , but at least he can teach consumers to critically ask his habits .	-4.5868
The Nasdaq OMX stock exchange operator continues to keep its customers in breath .	-2.9336
Trade at Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon in German .	-2.3439
In a communication the operator caused technical problems .	-2.4500
The other 11 US option markets , including two of Nasdaq OMX , continued their business freely .	-2.1326
The most recent incident continues a series of smaller and larger misgivings with the stock market operator .	-3.1717
It was only on Tuesday that Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour for errors in data transport .	-3.4652
In August this year there were two misgivings in one week alone .	-2.2742
First , Goldman Sachs , the US Investment Bank , had sent mass buying orders to the option markets for technical problems .	-4.5917
In response , the stock market operators needed almost a whole day to view and delete the order .	-4.0396
Two days later , half of the total equity trading in the US staged for several hours due to a Nasdaq exchange computer panel .	-4.8413
Last year the Facebook stock exchange was also screened .	-4.1441

Konstanz : Radler leaves 63 year-olds around .	-3.7437
The accident occurred after the police stated that a 26 year old man on Thursday evening , at 22 a.m. , was orderly travelling on the left road from the train station to the market place .	-6.4650
When a 63 year old man suddenly went on to the walkway , the bicycle driver , according to the police , could not slow down on time .	-6.2516

Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had received a “ invitation to stand up ” that invited him to appear in a police wake and added that if he did not live , he threatened him to be arrested .	-7.3295
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sex offence , after having exhausted its possibilities under British law , since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-4.3803
He fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the US on 19 June , he sought refuge at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.7156

Guide for foreign property owners against London ’ s speculative bubble	-2.7959
The Treasury has temporarily calculated the CGT measure , but is still awaiting the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who had imposed a stamp tax of 7 % in the 2012 budget on flats that cost more than two million pounds and annual charges for buyers who consider apartments as a company rather than as individuals .	-5.5316
Already , revenues from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which grew at <unk> 708 million in the tax year 2012 / 13 , collected revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , North-West , Yorkshire and Humber .	-4.6358
Cook said : “ After the stamp tax hikes on high prices housing and the introduction of the legislation relating to circumstances , one can hardly claim that high-quality homes are too low taxes , regardless of the effects of the outdated common tax system . ”	-7.1739
“ But that move could make some foreign investors more reticent in buying properties in London , or discourage owners from selling it , ” he added .	-4.4864
First-class real estate – the top five to ten % of the housing market at the price – in the wealthy southwest belt of London , which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon , has worsened by the record value of 1.8 % last year .	-5.3874
Central London ’ s prizes have seen steady growth of 5.6 % , but have been overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” in which the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) have experienced an upward trend , sa.	-5.8050
Scientists could shed more light on the context in which a dog ’ s tail is confronted with its mood .	-4.4297
Previous research had shown that happy dogs went more to the right ( in the view of the dog ) with the tail while in nervous dogs the left side was .	-5.2500
But scientists now say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.0656
Professor Georgio Vallorgara , a neuroscientist of the University of Trento , said : “ People know well that the left and right brain half respond differently to stimuli that generates positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.4700
Here we tried to look at this in other species .	-1.8284
He also noticed that dogs , like human dogs , have the right brain half for the movement of the left , and vice versa , and that the two hemisphones played different roles in sentiments .	-5.1141
To learn more about how dogs respond to their species ’ side tailored tailors , researchers monitored the animals while those films looked at other dogs .	-4.8916
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analysed the behavior .	-1.9377
We probably will soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , times in the other direction .	-3.2990
Professor Vallorgara said , “ We showed dogs with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette , to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we could control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-5.3761
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressed dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wearing dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.8389
But when the fluctuation was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog who wedded ) , their heart rate rose and they looked alarmingly .	-5.5242
According to Professor Vallorgara , dogs do not intentionally communicate through these movements .	-2.3985
Instead , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience where movements they should worry about and when not .	-3.4986
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and you are more likely to be linked to the tail in a direction with friendly behavior , and if the right side produces less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.5347
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to understand their animal 's emotions better .	-3.7293
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog preservation and host stipendiat at the Faculty of Animal Culture at the University of Bristol , declared that this was not the first study studying whether it was important for dogs on the left and right .	-5.3182
Last year , a team of Lincoln University found out that dogs turn left when they see an aggressive dog , and right when they are a satisfied dog .	-3.5008
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs tend to be on a robot dog when they are wearing tail ‘ left and not right , rather than becoming disturbing – very different from the Italian study . ”	-6.5994
According to his statement , the differences could stem from the fact that dogs in various studies did not interpret animals in films or robot dogs as dogs .	-3.7146
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he explained .	-1.5096
“ While there are considerable evidence of many different mammals that the two brain stages are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-4.5096
Because their behaviour is simply recorded , it will probably not be long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-4.3454
Arctic Monkeys will postpone appearance in Glasgow for the disease of Alex Turners .	-3.2431
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has postponed an appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer is ill with chicken inflammation .	-4.4709

Pope Francis appoints first cardinals in February	-1.7354
Pope Francis will be invoking new cardinals for the first time on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-2.7105
Cardinals are the most senior clerics in the Catholic church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who choose a Pope so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately be involved in choosing his successor .	-6.8791
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-0.8108
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope Elections – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals ” .	-5.4695
In a declaration in which the news was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman of the Vatican , said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinals , also known as the Consisttorium .	-9.1179
“ Pope Francis has decided to make his decision in advance to convene the consortium in February , so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” Lombardi said .	-4.6039
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals eligible will probably fall until February .	-2.6386
He explained that a Pope normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of cardinals eligible for elections is 120 again , and as many cardinals as he wants .	-4.4351
Next year ’ s consensus will be important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Mr Valero .	-4.9522
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe and , in particular , of Italy .	-2.4274
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-1.9140
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-1.6150
The cardinals will also be the first to invent the Cardinal Council , established since the formation of the Franciscan council , a group of eight cardinals from around the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church .	-5.0238
In the past the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.7488
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.1741
He explained that it was ‘ good ’ that Francis please ask for the cardinals for advice .	-3.9960
But up to now we have not been able to do this – this is all new .	-3.7044
Valero said that typically bishops would be called from large places to cardinals , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he will appoint . ”	-4.1605
GM is recalling new pickup trucks in the US to repair the length of seat . !	-12.1084
General Motors call back almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks with the construction year 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat length , a statement by the US Vehicle Safety Regulator on Friday .	-5.1558
There can be a defect in some of the cars in the mechanism for returning the chair .	-3.8787
For this reason , they do not comply with the federal directives on vehicle safety when headrests .	-4.0420
“ When abandoned on the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the inmates , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website ( NHTSA ) .	-4.4879
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.7727
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and is the most important model launch of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring of 2009 .	-8.6051
GM informed the vehicle owner of the defect in the first half of October .	-2.6526
The NHTSA could not check the letter of notification because of the 16-day governance of Shutdown , which had a negative effect on car purchases in October .	-4.4267
The sale of Silverado and Sierra Trucks , which were redeveloped for the model year 2014 , had risen by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , GM declared Friday .	-3.8027
In October GM sold 42.660 silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup trucks .	-2.4406
The GM stock rose by 1.4 % on the New York Stock Exchange to $ 37.47 on Friday afternoon .	-2.6459

Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible .	-1.9575
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-1.7996
I am reading a terribly sad book .	-1.6330
It is a book I believed it would raise my medical studies during the brush second year and give me hope again .	-4.7514
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” ( courage to win ) and portrays the Memoiren Barack Obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .	-4.3785
When I finish with my patient records and go to bed , the book returns to a time when politics could inspire millions and rob the breath .	-4.9571
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesperson thought to bear in mind the historic importance of this hour .	-3.8894
My classmates went with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-2.3351
A young team of visionaries was ready for change on the way to the White House and the nation .	-1.9447

And then I close the book .	-0.5170
Turning back to the present is a bad awakening , as if one is being swept out of a dream .	-4.4694
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed possibilities .	-2.0891
In the years since I first voted in favour , something has actually changed .	-2.2899
But it 's just nothing I could have imagined .	-2.3208
I recognise the great and versatile things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.4584
I agree that the party political blockade tactics have fought too many efforts to advance our nation : immigration reform , a public health insurance option and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name just a few .	-4.6729
But , having defended the Obama administration on countless occasions to colleagues and acquaintances , I ended up with my statement .	-4.4721
I have reached an issue of political despair .	-1.4731
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to cease or the killing of innocent children overseas by drones .	-3.6781
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency gathers data about Americans ’ private life , and why whistleblowers are being punished , disclosing government misconduct .	-3.6329
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without trial , still circumvents public financing and spending limits during the presidential elections .	-3.4327
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the White House to restore media are the most “ aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.4207
And , recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in the over three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.9926
I do not know if that is what I should have expected .	-1.7178
Whether I should have understood with 18 , intergovernmental work could contradict the political campaign that precedes it .	-3.4038
Obviously , the MP is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massacre shape public debate .	-4.0075
But when I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-2.3589
That bothers me most .	-0.6261
I voted Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.9406
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative that he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions .	-3.0193
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard for so long .	-2.9636
But , with Obama ’ s assent ratio of less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become even harder by this book .	-3.7741
It gives me a yearning for the many promises that have dissolved in air .	-3.5913
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to contest a serious loss against Clinton in primary elections in Pennsylvania .	-7.6339
In a meeting with the electoral victims after the decision , he told his staff that they had to return and follow the purpose of their cause .	-4.4995

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in parental leave .	-2.3280
The billionaire and member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it .	-3.5664
The mining magnate , which is in judicial dispute about the payment of $ 6 million in carbon tax , claimed that he wanted to wipe questions from the table whether he was in conflict .	-5.8050
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate that are important in deciding whether or not CO2 and mining taxes will be deleted or cut .	-3.6764
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.5450
“ He is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave because , if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether to have a holiday or not , ” said Palmer .	-3.6570
Two months after the election , the Palmer election commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast seat of Fairfax , with 53 votes in advance of the new count .	-4.2063
Palmer asked for a revision of the voice counting process to be made faster .	-4.6498

Why not have a system in which one marches down , inserts data into a computer immediately , and then has the result at 6.30 a.m. in the ev?	-5.4579
Palmer also criticised the use of pencil folders when marking the ballot .	-3.1580
Are they being used because you can eradicate the results if you do not like them ?	-3.5353
Coordination with pencils is incredible nowadays .	-3.1346
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.3633

RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers .	-1.7457
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign-exchange department , such as two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation is taking up rapidly the alleged manipulation of the currency market .	-5.4103
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperated with the authorities in investigating the world ’ s largest financial market , where $ 5.3 trillion are changing owners every day .	-3.9416
The two traders would be the first RBS employees suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank business entails .	-4.4259
The Bank , which did not comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .	-3.1194
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-3.0849
Last month , nearby individuals suggested that the RBS had redirected the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier retailer to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-4.6676
This retailer , Richard Usher , had left the RBS 2010 and is now to have been judged by his current position as European head of the forex spot trade at JPMorgan .	-4.4172
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading at Citi , was ruled this week and Matt Gardiner , former executive Barclays and UBS monetary dealer , was suspended at standard Chartered this week .	-3.7991
None of these traders were accused of misconducting .	-1.7290
Bankers in Barclays and Citigroup were owned by the instant messages group of Usher .	-3.3247
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its staff , after the Swiss Regulatory Authority , Finma , declared that it had studied alleged manipulation of the Forex Market on a number of Swiss banks .	-5.4838
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Agency Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently examining charges for bankers to have discussed transactions in the monetary market .	-7.4301
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people with the situation .	-3.3145
Banks carry through instant messages and e-mails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-2.9179
The news of these investigations has brought traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts speculators ’ chances .	-5.2638
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the expansive and highly liquid currency market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.8117
A leading dealer noted that , despite the enormous daily volume in foreign-exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks leads “ one can influence the market at very low ticket prices . ”	-5.0785
The news came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that she had cancelled a trader of their London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he caused a loss of nearly six million dollars at the end of last year .	-4.8298
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-1.8935
“ We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-3.6794
The building fence painted on the Bechtle plot .	-3.2237
A group of the citizens ' initiative " Swiss meadows " has bestowed the building fence on the Bechtle-Platz on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-5.8250
In addition , it cleaned and distributed the footpath , it is said in a press release .	-3.8523
The planned coverage of the crumbling house in the rear part of the plot was not allowed for safety reasons , because the area is threatened to slip .	-5.3726
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the plot , had agreed to the beauty action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-3.8856
Before the BI was promoted , ' We have been moved for ' transparency . '	-4.8175
That , however , did little to disturb the 20 members of the citizens ' initiative in their actions .	-3.1570
Your motto on the big poster was " We are against construction ruins " .	-3.2718
It wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on Swiss meadows - the giant project should one day fail .	-4.7009
In conversation with many passers-before the construction site , it became clear that some citizens believe that the city 's project will be a lot better , even though not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented , like the BI .	-6.4872
But they are starting to resign because the city continues to delay these responses , it is said from the BI .	-3.4459
As was heard , public statements by the mayor also work .	-3.1283
In May the municipal meeting said that he feared the outcome of the thermal bath , the public should vote against the plans for a spa and bathing complex on the Swiss meadow when deciding by citizens .	-7.0859
Some are therefore almost scared , others consider them to be ' plumbing blackmail ' to the population , as it is said in the BI press release .	-7.3535
The BI thanks the donors for the color and all the helpers .	-2.3002
Rangnick Slice for Schiris : Man no Schwolve King	-4.5779
So satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , the sports director of the " bulls " was disappointed by the arbitrators .	-4.9806
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the Schwolbenkönige category , " he put the two offensive workers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-4.5597
Yellow for Mane was 3 : 0 against Gardena last Sunday , during which Senegalese was supposed to be an actress - not , however , as the TV images showed .	-6.6678
" A big mistake " , said Rangnick , who referred to Harkam as " utterly overstretched " .	-9.2039
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the game .	-3.1361
He defended his German countryman in a decisive manner : " I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every .	-4.2336
Schmidt himself wants no contact with his colleague after the sharkmouth .	-3.3846
I do not know why .	-1.0917
" For I am the one who was offended , " emphasized the 46 year-old .	-2.3350
Given the success , Rangnick agreed to praise .	-4.0280
" For this there are only two words : right , " he said .	-3.6108
There is not much to be exposed .	-1.1289
Especially the way the team plays is impressive .	-1.7588
This should go on calmly so on .	-3.3342
Cadar changes during the winter transfer will hardly occur .	-2.7728

Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-0.7921
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-2.8125
With five to four votes , judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – it is forcing US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s fiscal authority .	-4.7118
John Robert ’ s chief judge was on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while Judge Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy decided against .	-7.0824
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages comprehensive law and also took the view that the provision of the health law whereby states would either have to expand access conditions for medicaid or otherwise cancel all state medicaid subsidies , is unconstitutionally unconstitutional .	-6.5254
The proceedings against the law had been tied by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-3.0826
The law was strongly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenge in Mitt Romney , during the early election campaign in 2012 .	-3.8087
Norway : Norwegian village makes itself light with giant mirrors .	-2.5231
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian town of Örtschen have brought light into their dark valley .	-4.2385
Due to the low degree of sunshine , the Rjukan valley in the Vestfjord valley usually sinks in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-4.0620
Three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters high were realized on Wednesday .	-3.8035
" End ! " , Mayor Steinar Bergsland feared at the launch ceremony in the Sender TV2 .	-4.4224
Some valley residents were entitled to solar chairs , others put sunglasses safely .	-4.6345
Until now , sun-hungry people in winter had to ride to a nearby peak with a cable car .	-4.7051
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct radiation with mirrors to the valley .	-2.6928
However , this basic idea has existed in place since 1913 .	-2.6570
After several years of debate , the city Council finally adopted the 5 million kroner ( around EUR 615 000 ) of expensive project .	-3.9111

Post empty scarcely Sundays	-2.4174
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red points for the Sunday empty are still in various letters in the core city and the city parts , but reading the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , you quickly find out that the empowerment is no longer taking place on Sundays and holidays " , the FDP is told .	-9.4172
A FDP request has confirmed this .	-1.8959
On Sundays and public holidays , only before the post office in the Ernst-Ludwig street 36 and in the Jakob-Müller-Straße 1 in Hüttenfeld is learnt .	-4.4612
Whether it is spent on Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten , the answer to the FDP question will not be answered .	-3.3311
The Social and Youth Policy Speaker of the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to follow up here .	-3.7527
Sunday cleaning is just an important postal service .	-3.5722
" This undertaking is radically and unreasonable , despite the increase in the price of letters on January 2013 . "	-3.5439
Thomas Bittner , Liberal Group and City Association Chairman , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that the space periods are being changed or even cancelled here ' .	-12.9224
The post office is a mile away from the proximity of the citizens .	-4.6216
" The letterboxes in the districts of Neuschloss and Rosengarten must be learned on Sundays " , Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono said .	-4.7511
It was also true for the core city , and especially non-mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a letter box with an empty Sunday too .	-6.4406
Röhrenbeck asked in the town parliament whether the town administration is going to discuss this matter with the post office .	-4.7769
Mayor Erich Maier responded that the post did not communicate with lampertheim .	-2.2579
But his knowledge there was also an empty Sunday in Hofheim .	-3.1667
After all , your party argued for privatization .	-2.3527
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " said Maier .	-1.2758
Frankfurt 's parking fees are to be increased strongly .	-3.7410
Parking in Frankfurt might become more expensive soon .	-3.4271
This morning , the city ’ s magistrate advises on a submission by traffic department Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-3.9431
This means that parking charges will be increased by 50 percent .	-2.3533
This is not to increase prices , but to reduce the time intervals between car clocks and parking machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-5.8525
In December , the Municipal Assembly will have to decide .	-2.6340
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this to be ' not a good idea ' .	-2.3647
The parking facility is " an undesirable advantage for smaller retailers " .	-4.7575
The German transport club believes that an increase after two decades is ' reasonable and , in fact , long overdue ' .	-3.1389
Public transport will also become more expensive .	-2.1393
Freudenstadt : Rapid actions surrump hosts .	-5.7389
With a narrow cader , the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to enter the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Schwabian Alb .	-4.9373
The elders stood with an experienced team on the other side .	-3.1550
Soon , however , it became apparent that it was not able to cope with the rapid actions of the tourists , including its age .	-6.4391
The Gönningers complained about the hard and placed strings .	-5.1389
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks promised by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz , and were not there for block defense .	-3.9474
Two high initial sentence profits clearly expressed the joy towns ' superiority in all considerations .	-4.6121
In the face of this overwhelming and playing performance , the third sentence was slightly laughing and lucky to the 3 : 0-end stand ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-5.8530

In Baiersbronn , the second teams of Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were held in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-4.7877
They delivered a tough two-hour match .	-1.6523
Nervosity on both sides mainly caused errors and point tendencies when balancing ; even at passports , the precision was sometimes defect and in some critical game scenes , the header prevented the perception of any point winnings .	-8.1025

Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not immediately reachable .	-3.1389
Samsung , Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google ’ s operating system Android , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft ’ s mobile products .	-3.4109
In 2011 , Google issued an initial requirement of more than $ 900 million for Nortel patents .	-2.2312
Google increased his offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.6365
Having overloaded the Nortel patents of Rockstar , Google Motorola Motorola mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also motivated by Motorola ’ s library to patents .	-4.5854
“ Although Google has failed to acquire the complaint patent during the auction , Google has violated and continued to do so , ” says the letter of complaint .	-4.5131

Egypt is sworn by the first freely elected presidents .	-2.6913
Mohammed Morsi dismisses the presidency , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mean the end of political disputes in Egypt .	-3.4969
Islamist Mohammed Mursi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country , asking for the successor of Husni Mubarak , who had been driven out of office for 16 months .	-4.3401
With his introduction to the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy some 60 years ago .	-2.8621
He laid the oath before the 18 black robbing judges of the court , which is based on the Nile and is in keeping with an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.7572
“ We want a better future , a new Egypt , and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcasted live on state television .	-3.7864
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy , and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an engineer trained in the US and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since it was founded 84 years ago , was largely targeted by the government in question as a banned organisation .	-5.4751
Hundreds of soldiers and police guard the building when Morsi arrived in a small autoconvoi just after 11 a.m. local time .	-3.7906
Only a few hundred supporters gathered before the court to celebrate the new president and , contrary to the presidential presence of the Mubarak era , traffic was stopped at a very short time so that autoconvoi could cross the normally lived street that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-6.9149
As an uncharismatic “ substitute wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented not only as the candidate of the Islamists , but all those who wanted to target the 2011 insurgency aspirations against the authoritarian Mubarak .	-4.7067
“ Egypt is today a civilian , constitutional , and modern state , ” explained to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he left office in a blue suit with red coat .	-5.1991
Later , Morsi went to the University of Cairo , where he was supposed to have his inaugural speech .	-5.5744
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel playing the national anthem he listened to in haba .	-3.5580
The military leader , Feldmarshall Hussein Tantawi , was present .	-1.5010
On his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of attendees in the largest hearing hall of the university with talks of “ The Army and the People are a hand ” .	-4.7713
The Cairo University , built in 1908 as the Bastion of Secular Education , developed into a Hochburg Islamist Student Group in the 1970s .	-3.9706
Mursi held a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square on Friday , the birthplace of the insurgency that led to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year , and he praised to withdraw presidential powers that the military council had assumed from office .	-6.1776
But , with the handing of the official oath before the court and not , as usual , before Parliament , he is bowing to the will of the military , suggesting that the struggle for power will continue .	-5.3737

The travel company now expects a fixed annual profit before taxes of between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to 315 million in its previous forecast .	-4.1527

As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and raised a strong start to the second half of the year , especially Australian and British private .	-3.9132

These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which are typically one of our strongest earnings carriers .	-3.7532
In Australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , which was a slightly weaker market for business travel .	-3.1897
Similarly , Flight Centre ’ s leisure business ran well in the United Kingdom , while business customers spend less . .	-8.4611

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum	-2.3738
The next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday , 21 October , at the Neue Museum of the Castle , deals with the theme " Zur Helle with hell - Theological considerations on today 's handling of the last things " .	-6.5684
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.4046
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parish of Salem , the Castle of Salem and the Cultural Office of the Bodensee region .	-4.4409
Johanna Rahner wants to examine the question in the forum , as today people classify the " last things " after death .	-4.0366
If people had known too much of it over the past centuries , putting on the pictures of heaven and hell , " which until now shape our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic lesson of hopes of completion is more like a degree of embarrassment or nonsense .	-7.2763
" The greater hope was driven out of Christians by religious critics " , says the referent .	-4.4504
They ' provided us with so many question marks that we seem to have gone away from the call ' .	-5.0572
Johanna Rahner continues to say : ' But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death ' .	-2.6742
This implies the question of the yearning , " dreaming of everything being good at the end of the day " .	-4.6137
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-2.1221

Ilmensee : Second mountain bike race enthusiasts participants .	-2.0425
With wonderful weather , 214 bicyclists arrived to Illmensee to cope with the round course around the lake .	-4.9460
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sport association Illmensee .	-3.4428
Participants were among the participants , especially at the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , as well as numerous wheelers who wanted to practice their hobby once in competitive atmosphere .	-7.9938
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this race : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came well with the recommendation for the German Championships .	-5.0150
These two were expected to leave .	-3.7864

In the second place Pascal Treubel was again placed .	-3.9313
At the Ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the Team Albdream who managed to top up the winner staircases .	-5.8782
On the square two and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen .	-2.4522
A good development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-3.1463
Not only in terms of performance , the whole bandwidth was represented by athletes .	-4.0039
The age structure extended from ten years to over 70 years at the oldest starters .	-3.9750
In the main race this year even more absolute topathletes at the start .	-2.6615
Four drivers were able to take the top regional drivers .	-2.5463
This includes Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tusk racing team . .	-11.6849
Pangerl , together with a team colleague , was already two times a World Champion in the twelve hour driving .	-4.5825
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline .	-2.0985
Roland Ballerstedt , who already named two German Championship titles in Duathlon , also .	-4.1764
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of height there was a Wimperschlagfinale in front of the Three Lake Hall .	-5.2893
Pangerl was the first to cross the finish line .	-2.6655

The winner will receive $ 250,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-2.1569
For 21 years , Georges Bwelle saw how his sick father constantly lost consciousness and traveled hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-3.7930
Jamef Bwell was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Camerus .	-4.0885
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation spread to his brain , causing a hematom that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.2632
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwell .	-1.7680
We would have taken him out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.2077
Instead , Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.7398
“ It ’ s not easy , ” Bwell commented .	-2.8365
We can leave the house at five a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and it is not the first .	-3.2688
There are a lot of patients . .	-1.7446
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.5689
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell 's father died in 2002 .	-1.9702
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , the World Health Organisation .	-2.7154
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-4.8390
But even if there were a doctor , most of the cameras could not afford to visit . .	-7.5228
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of domestic health expenditure are private .	-2.6755
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwell .	-0.9326
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.1542
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered to see Bwelle ripped the determination to do something about it .	-3.9429
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year .	-3.9125
He became a doctor himself and works as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.2558
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels on weekends in rural areas and offers free medical care .	-3.2159
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.1108
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people confess in small buses and use the narrow medical equipment on the roof over unfixed terrain to the villages that need help .	-5.5879
Not always runs smoothly .	-1.0636
More than once , they had to shoot the vehicles by rivers and mud .	-8.2110
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a festival , voice , and dance , and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-4.1199
In these villages , free medical care really is a reason to celebrate and bubble – with its broad smile and limitless energy – is happy to celebrate .	-4.6327
The next morning , the team starts investigating hundreds of patients .	-2.1320
“ We treat 500 persons per drive , ” says Bwelle .	-4.2712
They come from a circle of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-2.3942
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.2985
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.2336
Others receive cracks , donated glasses , or free birth-documents – a document that is required for school , but that many poor families simply cannot afford .	-5.6109
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local stunning .	-2.2684
The operations normally take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after intervention patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make space for the next .	-5.4197
Lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group , so Bwelle and his volunteers work until the early hours of Sunday .	-3.9291
It is a tough pensum , but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .	-2.7198
“ You smile all night so we can stay awake and continue our work , ” Bwelle says .	-4.3227
On Sunday the team then moves back to the city , tired , but proud of the work done .	-3.2006
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with its work , it has created a huge difference for the people to whom it helps .	-7.2835
A man explained that the free operation of a collapse of power he has received now allowed him to work again .	-4.8287
“ That change the future of my family , ” said the man .	-1.9739
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.4955
With this second job , he is financing 60 % of his non-profit activity , so the rest are from private donations .	-6.6621
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia and voluntarily participated in Bwelles Group in the second year .	-3.5589
He is always in hospital or trying to spend money on the organisation so that he can go to these campaigns .	-2.8735
This is an opportunity for medical and health students like O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe , to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-4.8973
“ We can be at surgery where we help to stop blood or think of the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , ” says O 'Malley .	-4.8081
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.4174
Students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and bring with it frequently donated sanity material .	-3.2591
Once in Yaoundé , however , Bwell takes care of accommodation , transport and instruction .	-4.1601
“ He is certainly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-1.8432
He devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits .	-1.9842
The almost constant work is not a burden for Bwelle .	-3.9811
To help others to make life happier , to fulfil a promise that he has given to his father , he is very happy .	-6.2466
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwell .	-2.6804
And I remember my father .	-1.1142
I hope he will see what I am doing .	-1.3502
I do it to make people laugh again and to alleviate the pain .	-1.8410

Excellent Combat Easter	-4.0902
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " Der Old Man und the Sea " , has been cut to the body by Horst Janson .	-3.5485
Janson himself is an old hare in his meter , the actress art .	-3.0040
The old man Santiago cannot do anything about fishing .	-3.0108
So the two are simply great .	-2.1840
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the corner of the old man , of whom the fishermen young Manolo speaks .	-4.8486
If Santiago tired of life badly sitting on the chair , Janson is real .	-7.6806
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson performs excellently .	-3.8056
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against fish through his knowledge and his will . .	-7.9274
Janson is widely seen as the sole player on stage .	-3.8722
He manages to focus the attention of the audience , so his monologists are not boring at the .	-3.3098
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of water are so real that spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue watertight bottles .	-4.9510
Director Jens Hasselmann gives the old man a boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.5224
In the course of performance he reflects the respective active scene : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her magnificent voice , holds Cuba 's sense of life .	-5.8588
The four musicians play Kubas rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-3.2919
Tourism : descent to the Romans	-1.7071
At about 120 meters in length there is a sewage channel from the Roman period below Cologne . le.	-9.1513
If you visit Cologne you will not pass the Duomo .	-3.6873
Around 157 meters , the towers are in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.4933
But few visitors who admire the two filigrant churches guess that there is also a lot to discover under the Cathedral .	-4.2787
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne 's Underworld .	-2.0791
The service centre of Cologne Tourism is directly on the Dom .	-3.9678
The tour starts quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-2.8469
In the seventies , the city 's fathers wanted to be a car-free city , and that is why the remnants of the old city wall remained just that which was not too large .	-6.0073
Most of the parkhaus users now also run by the Roman remains and only deposit their car . and . and . and , , , , , , ,	-9.1488
But anyone who looks closer , discovers the archaeological site in the Parkdeck D2 .	-4.1985
There are about five meters high ruins of hand-size stones .	-5.1726
" There are remnants of the Roman city walls built to Christ in the second half of the first century , " Schulze tells .	-3.8045
Before returning to the daylight , Schulze still gives a glimpse of a dark , 15 metres deep shaft to the upper parkland .	-6.6386
This is the well of the old dome , which is unfortunately hardly perceived .	-4.2401
Next stop of round tail is the pretorium , and here the participants get down to depth .	-6.2896
We see here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the CAA Pretor .	-3.7703
What CAA means , a visitor would like to know .	-1.3596
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in good German as " the city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippines , founded under Kaiser Claudius at the place of the Altar for the Emperor " .	-5.4467
And the Pretorium is the former Statthalter Palace , the Power Centre of the Roman Empire in the Rhine .	-3.8335
From the pre-exhibition , a tunnel access to the Roman waste water channel , which is preserved here at around 120 meters in length .	-3.9541
" You can walk calmly a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want " , muthe guests .	-4.6409
Surprise is still in Schulze .	-2.2076
After holding the key on the ticket , he leads the group to a 16-metre deep shaft .	-4.6820
" We are now in the mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.8279
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground to get to the groundwater , which was essential for ritual washing .	-8.1093
Until today , at the lower end of the mikwe , the origins of which go back to the eighteenth century , different water stands can be read through changing Rhine peg .	-6.2260
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square for which the construction works will start soon .	-3.9150
However , some years will pass before completion .	-3.3807
Nearly hacked : Reignition of Rocker Process	-3.8956
A bloody attack in the rock milieu is rerolled after four years .	-2.5189
A trial of attempted deaths , dangerous bodily injury and material damage to two thirty years has begun before the Frankfurt District Court ( Oder ) .	-5.9606
It is accompanied by strict safety measures .	-1.3120
The defendants kept quiet about the start .	-3.3156
They should have been active in the rock scene and listened to the bandios at that time .	-4.5834
The Public Prosecutor prompts them to join in June 2009 with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt on three men in a car .	-4.5127
All victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-2.3191
The victims should have heard of the competing group Hells Angels .	-2.9398
A high-level member of Berlin was to have been a .	-4.3151
It seems that had been preceded by a prosecution hunt with several cars .	-3.3904
According to the indictment , there was a power demonstration .	-2.4508
The two accused had been released in early 2012 in a first procedure .	-2.7286
A court speaker said then that it could not be proved that men were actually involved in the bloody mistake .	-3.6196
The perpetrators had worn masks and were not recognized .	-1.5903
The Federal Court lifted the ruling after the Public Prosecutor 's revision and referred it back to the District Court again .	-4.0102
One of the defendants is currently enforced because of another offence .	-3.8669
The main focus was the reconstruction of the procedures at night .	-4.0159
As a witness , the Commissioner who was arrested at that time was loaded .	-3.6702
In the centre , mobile talks were held by the accused and other people who had stopped the police .	-4.6494

In response to the numerous media reports about redundancies , Obama called on Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for a new insurance .	-4.0570
Most citizens could thus receive better , broader health insurance for the same price or less projected .	-3.1596
“ You get a better offer , ” he said .	-1.4923
The government described it as little surprising that the five percent of the population that had completed insurance would have to look at a different rate , because their treaty did not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-6.4838

The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already been , in part , successful , attempted to deliver ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-3.5394

John Kerry , with an unexpected concession , suggested a weakening of America ’ s defenceless stance on its surveillance programs by saying that , in certain cases , spying had “ gone too far ” .	-6.0219
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for placing on “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden about NSA ’ s spy activities were publicly published .	-5.3515
The information leaked has brought the US government into a diplomatic storm of disarmament on the part of its allies . . , , . , , , , , , , ,	-7.5372
In a speech delivered by video binding at the Open Governmental Conference in London , Kerry said : “ Question without question , the president and I , as well as others in the government , have learned of a few things that have almost run by autopilot , simply because the ability to do what is going back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , September 11 ”	-8.8347
Subsequently , he was the first high-level member of the US Administration to admit that the US espionage crossed a border , but also emphasized that no rights were misused .	-5.2701
He said , ‘ in some cases , this has gone inadequately too far . ’	-3.1673
The President is determined to clarify and therefore conducts a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that there are abuses here .	-4.5949
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-1.5568
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good , and that it was saved many lives by its surveillance operations .	-6.8544
He added : “ We have a new world in which people are prepared to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.6029
There is radical extremism in the world that fails to kill people , break in the air , and attack governments .	-3.0342

Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and others this week and is concerned about their threats not to participate in anti-terrorist organisations because of the National Security Agency 's frustration of monitoring .	-4.2646
“ It is very important for US national security interests to keep Europeans on board with our joint efforts to combat terrorism , ” Murphy , who is sitting in the Senate for the first time as a Democrat chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , declared in an interview in Washington .	-5.0645
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes .	-3.0673
Media reports that the NSA collected millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , even though the head of the secret service this week stated that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.8041
Other revelations quoted from Snowden 's passed documents , whereby the NSA had overseen the mobile phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders .	-7.8983
The head of national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended the espionage as necessary in allies and declared that this was common on both sides .	-3.8990

He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programmes they have been using for years .	-3.8413

Australians appealed against prison sentence in Thailand .	-2.8208
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney , who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket because she wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver , has appealed and was released on deposit .	-3.6031

However , later the pictures of a video camera showed that she was safe in her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend .	-4.6528
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they confessed to have evolved the story .	-7.5761
She was present in police custody until the trial was negotiated .	-7.8154
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a detention centre with low safety levels on the periphery of Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .	-4.1549
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former Australian Rubgy-League player who addressed the Canberra Foreign Ministry with the request for help for his daughter .	-3.9235
Tunks told Sydney ’ s Sunday Telegraph that the whole family is “ extremely worried ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-3.5555
“ Of course we are worried about it , but we hope it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.2235
Bamford has deposited against the judgment appeal and is at large against a deposit of 50,000 railways .	-4.4808
In Australia 's reports it was necessary to read that she is on holiday in Krabi in South Thailand .	-4.2471
It was from the court ’ s side to hear that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and had been warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-4.4076
However , it is also possible that , after the recent assassination of the travel buyer Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand could endeavour to improve its attacked tourist image , and that is why there is a clear voice .	-6.4841
