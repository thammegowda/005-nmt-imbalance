Munich 1856 : Four maps that change your view of the city	-2.9516
A mistaken institution where young people are expected to meet today .	-4.2369
A group chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is being digged .	-3.4694
Small-scale partners manage the former reason for farfar. not only are small smsmall-small ones small-sa small small small-ssmall on.	-19.8009
The oldest official map in Munich promotes exciting stories to days .	-2.7097
It nerves if maps are not up to date .	-1.9172
This knows everyone who had to get excited , because the auto navi displayed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-5.1824
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlase , an offer of the Geoportal Bavaria of the State Government , are anything but current - but this is precisely why very insightful .	-4.8725
Especially when compared to current online maps .	-2.4659
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the nineteenth century in the distribution area of Munich .	-3.3052
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a flicking epic that you don 't recognize as such .	-5.0107
The large survey card was collaborated with more detailed maps for cities and communities , so-called urposition sheets .	-4.8013
These were created according to the Bavarian Management Administration between 1810 and 1864 and corresponded to the first measurement of Bavaria .	-4.2305
Your Customer : Napoleon .	-1.4993
The French army leader has been occupying Bavaria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.5795
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical reception of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-3.0903
Although the French troops eventually departed from the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , today ’ s neighbors created the idea of an extensive Bavarian card .	-4.1732
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph pursued the project further , established the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian Management Administration .	-3.6944
The original sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like any other on the Bavarian Library website .	-3.8783
The comparison earlier / today is most impressive in the city 's capital .	-3.5094
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.4144
An example of this is subsendling , which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .	-2.9286
Sendling was communicated 21 years after the creation of the map , in 1877 , as a Munich district .	-3.3239
Today , undersendling is in the middle of the city .	-2.7018
The buildings undersendlings focus around 1856 along the present Plinganserstraße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-4.1020
Where the Western Park is today , nothing is seen as fields - at first glance : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten pieces from the so-called " Uratake " from which the property tax was derived .	-6.6615
Small parcells today no longer occupy farmers - but small participants in the plant " Land in Sun " .	-4.6197
A large green area is located north of Untersendling .	-2.5379
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the October Festival , was indeed a meadow in the 19th century , not a concrete desert .	-3.7354
On the other hand of Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.4231
In today 's Au-Haidhausen district , you can read not only the name of the street " at the guest house " or the hill " on the air " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-5.6378
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstraße people were blocked with madness ideas .	-4.1022
There , in 1858 / 59 , the Munich Kreis-Irrenanstalt " On the Auer Füften " was created .	-4.8123
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who is brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II .	-15.9209
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chain of so-called errors .	-2.8275
In addition , he has prohibited the staff from applying violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt .	-4.8977
For 280 patients , it was initially square , later it was expanded to 500 seats .	-4.0814
At some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circle mansion in Haar 1905 .	-15.9931
There , since 2006 , the Isar Amper Clinic of Munich East , is one of Germany 's largest psychiatrics .	-3.9644
The former Auer Anstalt area now meets young people in Munich Salesianum .	-3.0873
The Orden acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-3.2941
Western lies the football pitch of TSV Munich East , eastern residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.0936
In 2015 , the children ’ s house “ Casa Don Bosco ” was built - in architectural foundation of the Irrenanstal ’ s origin , which was destroyed in bombings in the Second World when bombs were destrowere in 201in .	-18.1431
The Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as the " Haupt Square " , the Kaufingerstraße ( " Kaufinger Gasse " ) .	-4.5711
The Second World War brought a significant change in the heart of Munich .	-2.4131
The Allied bombs in December 1944 bring many holes into the city centre .	-3.1068
A big remained - at the Marienhof .	-2.7566
The English Institute , small business houses and a Middle Ages group chapel once stood at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn tribe .	-6.0246
With the slider you can compare the old Munich card with today 's air image - and fill the hole on the Marienhof .	-4.2517
Travel Warning for Missouri	-1.7815
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri because of discriminatory policies and state racist attacks .	-3.4898
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which will enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and missourians to pay special attention to travel by the state and to be extremely careful , as a number of questionable , race-based incidents have recently occurred in the entire state and are noted here , " the opinion of the group .	-6.2202
A recently adopted Missouri law , which makes people more difficult to gain discrimination laws , as well as the law enforcement authorities in the state that aim disproportionately at minorities , led the group to issue travel warning , said NACP .	-4.6824
" You have violations of civil rights that people happen .	-2.6368
They are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , " said Missouri NACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-3.0229
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . '	-1.7696
It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the US .	-1.9944
The group cited incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.0443
Sanders died in questionable circumstances early this year after he had no petrol during the trip by the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of crime .	-4.3101
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Prosecutor 's office , which shows that black drivers in the state are more often than white .	-3.9820
" The recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.4680
" People have to be willing to carry payment money or to let relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-4.7217
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hatred crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hatred crime reporting programme , which classified the state as regards the number of such injuries at the 16th level of the country .	-5.0029
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.6485
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states adopted immigration laws obliging local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , which , in the opinion of the ACLU , will contribute to further race profiling .	-15.7255
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends in the US .	-3.0952
Weidezaunproject is fundamental	-3.4956
The Fischerbach Weidezaun-Project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.0092
The CDU state members Peter White and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the spot .	-4.1142
At the right-grave farm of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU local association , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members , merepresentatives of the Fischerbach and in , in , the the the of and the the of of of of of	-17.7292
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his operation , in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 milk cows and also many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.9432
The " Black Forest Milk " is for him the alternative marketing route for milk of his cows , Schwendemann .	-3.2470
The table of the guests is exclusively regional .	-3.1741
Because he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaunproject " fundamentally important " .	-3.3610
I cannot profit in such sharp areas .	-2.4539
The green land surface provides a lot of work , much needs to be handled with the engine sense .	-4.6761
" We are fighting here with the conditions and with the topography " , Schwendemann stressed .	-3.3358
In 2003 he took over parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser , even if he does not carry biobeties .	-3.8553
For Mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : " The municipality recognized the importance of the Weidezaunproject and is happy about leader support " .	-3.9029
In the event of costs of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare , farmers should be supported .	-2.5926
One hopes that this could lead to a whole long period of afforestation of land .	-5.8573
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate , " the mayor emphasized .	-3.9752
Farmers are often in criticism because of promotion	-13.5827
In 2013 , a total of 25 participants were fenced by eleven participants through the grass fen.	-22.2566
This means that the opening area is 40 hectares , which cannot be forested up until at least 2023 .	-3.6599
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was encouraged by leader , a quarter of which was the town of Fischerbach .	-4.6209
Thus , farmers remain EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence .	-3.3124
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences , " said Schwendemann .	-2.6441
Kordula Kovac emphasised : " You do a good job , without farmers and farmers it does not ' .	-4.2027
Peter White also stood firm : " Here are the best food produced " .	-3.7136
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state support for Weidezenen .	-3.7012
The aim is to disclose the Black Forest .	-2.0572
The presence of a subsidy called LPR is required .	-4.0307
Furthermore , the land to be fed must not be delayed manageable ( slowdown above 35 % ) , and thus must be threatened by forforest. .	-22.7134
For the 2018 Fischerbacher Weidezaunproject , the request for eight participants with 24 parcells is currently running , which want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .	-4.8123
The opening area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-2.9939
Is nothing sacred ?	-0.9454
Now the Trump White House is taking the statue of freedom	-14.6568
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-1.9744
The Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on the Firdo Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.6298
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the status of freedom .	-3.7200
To stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue himself .	-1.5001
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-2.2571
But he attacked its importance , and in particular the meaning that she was attributed to when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-21.4123
When Miller Acosta said : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the statue of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-4.1815
The poem you refer to was added later and is not part of the original statue of freedom ' .	-2.9567
Miller is absolutely right , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.3064
It is a matter of contemporary resonance to the upgrading words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrant , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mothers , your poor , / your harsh masses , who see themselves free to breathe / the waste of your rich coasts ' .	-6.1961
There was never a time when the " wretched waste " was better to see on our screens .	-2.5220
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s U.	-14.5028
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.2717
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to put their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they had a highly political act .	-4.2884
The sculpture should show the connections between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in an abused classical picture .	-3.8367
Lazarus changed this meaning : In its poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-3.0253
And it gives itself a quite different name : mother of the exilers .	-2.6457
The connection of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.2971
And , just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it for a long time .	-15.3080
The Great Schreihal Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of the Dear for Trump ’ s coming , argued in 2010 that freedom statue is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the refurbished world : “ Lady Liberty goes ahead .	-5.6218
It is to wear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.4399
The torch is not to enlighten the path into the United States . '	-4.0023
Limbaugh has encountered something unusual here .	-3.1839
The importance of the statue is a matter of perception .	-2.4374
The great fantasy action of Lazarus was to see them in the way they were seen by the exhausted , wretched but hopeful people after long and often horrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-4.7872
It is truly a matter of seeing the world from the perspective of people , of seeking refuge , and of a chance to improve their lives . in a way the world is .	-24.4615
Your statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .	-2.4849
And , of course , this is not the prospect Miller and Trump would ever want to recognise .	-3.4084
Their torch should not enlighten the path , but inflict the hatred that is their only source of power .	-3.6232
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the British team in Bpart . the the of the of the in the of the of the of of .	-14.9932
Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scots were part of the British team of Britain	-2.8930
The Performance Director of the United Kingdom Light-Tathletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish quota will make a massive contribution to the team in the World Championship Cader " " a in . a in and the the the the the the in of of the	-17.8738
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .	-1.7531
Black believes that " something special is developing in Scotland " and the United Kingdom 's lightweight athletics must learn something from it .	-3.8905
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find out it , " said black .	-17.2140
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.4549
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.8707
British Light-Tathletics : There is something to do with what they have done .	-2.4402
And also with the type on the road corner .	-2.0144
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant ' .	-1.9526
Several of the Scottish athletes are medallic contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will take off Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to team captain .	-5.2443
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.4269
Your capital speech was incredible , " says Black .	-1.9084
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and motivated .	-2.6804
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally introduced were great . '	-3.9981
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will join the 400m-hurdles in her fifth world championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.1754
Scotland ’ s best total of athletes at the World Championship was seven , reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.0701
The Muir middle range leads along this path and set five British and two European records last year .	-3.6883
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m running .	-3.0851
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scottish to be watched after a great season that contained the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.2545
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scottish Scot was in the Team Lee McConnell .	-4.3953
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " to the fact that many of her compatriots will not only belong to the team , but in some cases will also interfere with the medals and the finals .	-4.8112
" Being a special team captain , it is because she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , making it somewhat special for me " , she added .	-4.6106
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team .	-1.8049
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.3732
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise in podia .	-3.1250
What concerns my speech as captain ?	-2.0590
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.0848
I just said that we are very happy in this situation because we have a World Cup .	-2.7705
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-15.0763
I get a second chance to go and compete there , and that will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-4.0040
Blocking critics about Facebook : Don 't buy a public office if you cannot contract the heating of voters	-5.0829
The father of our country knew something of a bad press .	-1.9014
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-2.9204
He died in criticism , safe .	-3.4339
But he did not silence his critics .	-0.9850
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb are led to slaughter as sheep . '	-3.7397
This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-1.7182
Hogan ’ s staff blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-2.6965
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week .	-15.9745
The bar of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a counter-reaction with " Na , and " .	-3.1492
" It is only Facebook , " many people said .	-1.6503
But it is important .	-0.8304
And it is especially important for it to be a type like Hogan .	-15.9112
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-1.9404
He has the second highest agreement of the 50 governors of the nation .	-13.5386
Hogan is not a reactionary heat heat .	-1.2811
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .	-2.8639
He was also very skilful to use Facebook as a primary means of combining with his constituents and playing his harless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-4.0802
Therefore , blocking people who come to the side of the governor is a public forum that is officially called and paid by staff paid with public tax dollars is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.0818
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking the comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-20.2459
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hatred people who swing online the stick .	-28.1424
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-1.7331
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a parish , not a troll .	-3.0425
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profan .	-1.7640
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-1.9612
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked for hate crimes .	-2.1097
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news " , she wrote in the comments section of the news sending " The Post " .	-2.9456
" I also do not appreciate this idea if a number of people adopt a position on the same subject , then some of them are being disregarded as a so-called collective approach and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected ' .	-5.9660
What the governor ’ s employees called a “ concentrated spam attack ” would likely call others " advocate .	-4.1739
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.3473
It is much cleaner than in the past , if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guide articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-3.8058
This is what is happening just digitally .	-2.3966
Hogan is not the first public official who is criticised for harassing facebook and other social media .	-2.2958
President Trump is sued by twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.7931
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-1.8286
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudon County injured the First Amendment , according to US judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a constituent from her Facebook page .	-3.9632
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.7684
That should not be so difficult .	-1.6606
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable porto had a similar effect as the Internet .	-2.8391
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous writers beaten his leadership .	-3.1019
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2098
People who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters of newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-2.8709
Petitions , which criticised his position on the Amity Treaty , trade and shipping with the United Kingdom , overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-3.7971
But he did not silence them .	-1.1744
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourse are the basis of our nation .	-2.2830
And real leadership means accepting this .	-1.7702
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-1.3295
Former Europeans No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will organise the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-3.6498

Less lung cancer Death by Passive Smoking	-2.0247
Over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer .	-2.1723
Scientists of the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) come to this result in a study .	-3.1982
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking every year " , Heiko Becher studies said .	-3.1404
As a comparison he made his own study on this subject of 1994 .	-3.4533
At that time , there were 400 lung cancer deaths for passive smoking in Germany per year .	-2.7220
The new investigation is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-1.7107
Domestic connections prove to be very complex	-2.4196
The construction work in the Villinger Strasse is underway and " lies somewhat in time " , said the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-5.3096
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because underground hides a lot , which is not mentioned in the plans .	-4.3193
The traffic that continually impedes the construction work is a major problem for the Stumpp building troop .	-4.3114

" There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most uneasy eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a declaration .	-3.0557

Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.6242
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal Council .	-3.2578
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-2.8076
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must pay back .	-3.2509
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2094
Despite the threats and intimidations , Paniai ’ s victims led to a last symbolic act of despite it : the body of a victim was buried in an area precisely against the police and the military station .	-5.0973

A fire found on Friday in one of the highest living towers in the world in Dubai its breakthrough and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee 79-storey buildings from the 337 metres high .	-19.7414
It is the second fire which , in just two years ' time , is called the Torch Tower ( Fackel Tower ) .	-4.6682
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-17.3859

We ran the staircase down , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor " , told a resident who named George , Reuters .	-4.0339
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fight against fires at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 GMT ) deleted the fire and cooled the building .	-3.5961
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-2.8155
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high houses around the world .	-3.3730
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from clothing , external clothing to decoration or isolation .	-3.7485

A survey under passenger passengers showed that more than 20 % consciously or unconsciously prohibited objects were smuggled at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % that accounted for the aircraft while accidentally banned knife or other objects with blades .	-5.7722
Less than 1 % claimed that they were delayed to have travelled mistakenly with guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.3192
The survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers failed to respect the rules .	-3.8691
Of those respondents who admit that they tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % of millennials were compared to less than 15 % that were members of the generation X .	-4.5392
The most common items intentionally passed on to TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.7270
More than 3 percent gave rise to knowledgeable objects carried by security control , while 2.2 percent of female surveys and 3.7 percent of male surveys also confirmed that they had deliberately banned drugs into the aircraft .	-4.8917

It is no surprise that the people who carry the best smuggling goods - knowingly or ignorantly - by safety were those who fly most often .	-4.6904
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.0913
People are often unsure which liquids they may take or how much of them .	-3.4931
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids banned by TSA are banned .	-2.7079

Elon Musk does not matter : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders	-2.6423
Electro thousand sassa Elon Musk is pleased to indicate with the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.8801
He has suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-3.0451
In addition to the always triumphant numbers on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla-Chief Elon Musk , for the first time , betrayed another , less glossy figure in the announcement of the recent quarter balance : cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-5.8763
In recent months , Musk has frequently bought the more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-4.5543
Musk now acknowledges that 63,000 pre-orders have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 .	-3.1776
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are just non-binding reservations .	-2.7126
In case of cancellation , Tesla pays the EUR 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and Britain 1000 pounds ) " Booking payment " completely back .	-4.4050
Currently , 45,000 such non-binding reservations are available , musk received a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.5146
But the Tesla chief does not believe that cancellation could become around 12 % of all orders .	-30.7495
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but on the production side .	-2.0172
Last year Tesla provided 84,000 vehicles .	-1.6560
In 2018 , all models should be 500,000 , one million in 2020 .	-2.7375
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.2777
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are made per day .	-2.9667
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you may expect to deliver at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its new production roads , which have never been tested in practice , without maximum disruption .	-6.0377
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.3178
However , if there are more delays , the non-binding reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-3.8489
Because then , the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in darks .	-4.4259
EPA leader Pruitt is dragging back to the delay in Obama Era ’ s rules to reduce emissions in .	-21.1840
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the environmental protection authority , returned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of smog causing pollutants .	-4.1923
Pruitt presented change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than before .	-3.4155
He did not mention the complaint that was made against his previous office in a federal appeal court .	-3.3157
It is a deadline for states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for ground ozone .	-3.2026
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time , study the plan and avoid interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth .	-3.1241
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules .	-2.9964
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to blocking or delaying regulations that oppose the chemical industry and fossil fuels industry .	-2.7000
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal backlash for the priits of regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.7614
Last month , a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-20.0374
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his turn to ozone standards simply strengthens the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in time .	-4.1845
" Under previous administrations , the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the deadline for implementation , " Pruitt said that the EPA sued more than a dozen times in its previous job .	-4.6236
" We do not believe in legal proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.0060
We are also taking the law and authority that exists . '	-13.7361
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA said that Pruitt will at some point use its ' delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on solid policies and the best available information ' .	-4.6514
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader revision of the ozone rules .	-2.0104
A draft legislation approved last month is to delay the implementation of 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.4267
The measure was not yet put to the vote in the Senate .	-2.0184
The New York General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states that sued the EPA this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-3.1884
" The reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the Smog , who flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-16.3334

Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village small " .	-3.3063
In 1267 , the St. Hilarius Chapel was first mentioned in the Württemberg certificate book : Graf Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the parish church in Tumlingen , including the Vogtei " at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark Silver .	-4.6058
According to the text of the document , the Tumlinger mountain , apart from the former parish church , was also a magnificent courtyard to which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not the other way around .	-6.3920
So people lived there too .	-2.0447
As shown in the description of the Oberamt Freudenstadt in 1858 , alongside the sub-village and the Oberdorf , which are currently understood in the village of Tumlingen , the " mountain " of the third , the magnificent settlement centre of the village .	-5.9162
Old maps from the period around 1600 underpin this history .	-2.9252
Patronate law was born of early medieval church law .	-3.6890
A Lord who built a church , equipped and occupied with a parish remained the owner of this church , and could inherit that churand inhea .	-22.7696
This was the right to use a parish or to propose a new parish to the bishop .	-3.4428
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.2341
The bigger of the two distorted to Christmas in 1673 .	-3.9652
The newly built belt came first in 1692 but later had to be placed in the Second World War in 1942 .	-5.1304
In the 30-year-old war ( 1616 to 1648 ) , window slides were beaten and the belt ropes were stolen .	-18.9832
Very friendly and helpful staff .	-4.6324
In 1796 French troops stored near the church .	-1.5185
They broke out the church and chair chairs and used them as firewood .	-3.5058
The remains of the church threatened to crash in 1809 .	-2.0593
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius graveyard also served as the last rest place for the dead from Hörschweiler .	-2.9624
In 1823 , the graveyard was extended and the Hilarius Church broke off .	-12.7244
Only the church tower was left .	-2.4916
In the New Year ’ s Night in 1834 , a storm collapsed the Church tower and half crashed .	-21.1867
To prevent an accident , the tower was broken off .	-2.9079
Only the tower dwarf still present today was the witness of the 750 years of old church history .	-3.1234
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem are maintaining the Hilarius system as a successor to Dieter Dockhorn .	-3.3277

The Serenade takes place only at dry weather .	-2.6556
The organizers hope to receive the historic St. Hilarius facility , which is important for tumults and pilgrims .	-5.3413
The friends and promoters Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade Organizer Walter Martini reaffirms .	-4.1691
Association wants to check authorisation of wind wheels	-2.7437
" Boisheim resists herself " does not see a legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat Council .	-4.4404
The association " Boisheim resists itself " has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its permission for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.1471
It is unlawful .	-1.4095
The Association argues that , at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Nette , no wind power plants could have been authorised , since at the time in four only a wind concentration zone existed at the town border on the Schwalmtal Valley .	-5.9935
Within this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind energy facilities is fundamentally possible , while the concentration zone is also an exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-17.1661
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being ' ' ' ' ' ' . '	-16.3121
Although the city of Viersen decided a second concentration of wind power in the Boisheimer Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan , it was not approved by the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a form error .	-5.9713
" The absence of a planning legal requirement remains unlawful and therefore withdraw " , said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim resists .	-4.9735
Current state of affairs : before the summer break the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette decided again ; an authorisation of the district government is over .	-5.6579
Erkens : " This excludes the granting of an authorisation for the construction of wind energy plants " .	-4.6492
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .	-1.8240
" The corresponding letters have received four people from last week , " said a spokesman .	-4.2267
The circle takes the opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-2.6655
But they probably do not mean that the procedure is stopped .	-3.4953
With regard to current proceedings in the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not wish to express its opinion on the reasoning of the association ' Boisheim ' .	-4.6330
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four metres high wind wheels on an area on the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.3022
Last year , the company , in which the city of Viersen is directly involved , had concluded practical contracts with the owner of the around 65 hectares large grounds in in the past the year . the towin the of the the the of the of the and the of the the of the of the of the of the of the of the of the	-29.5508
With the construction of the four wind energy plants , the electricity needs of around 11 400 households can be met - approximately one fifth of the electricity needs of all four-households .	-4.5016
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.4110
Last summer , Foursen ’ s town council gave the green light to purchase three wind power facilities in the Linnich wind park and to participate in a wind power plant in Ubach-Palenberg at the Heinsberg district .	-5.1039

Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Pin to to .	-17.9250
On 27 January , Trump called on to stop publicly in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.7001
The US president was denouncing him publicly , according to reports , " You cannot tell the press . "	-15.3144
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and swore to pay for the project .	-3.0427
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.3776
Mr. Trump said , Mr. Turnbull , that a trade for the US refugees emigrating to Australia would be ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence of the trade conveyed by the Obama administration would look like a ' depp ' after proposing a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US .	-5.1567

Moores Ford Massacre : Activists are restoring racist lynchact as a call for justice .	-13.3932
A 1948 Ford Mercury moved through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rummed on the Ford bridge of Moore .	-3.8989
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-2.6199
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train to his cigar and looked through the windscreen test . a in the a a of the of the and the of the the the of the .	-20.6730
Inside , the occupations swept in fear .	-3.6866
" We want this n --- r roger ! " brought the man .	-3.1978
'Get him out of the car ! '	-1.6601
Cry the silence when a young black man was destroyed by the front-passenger seat .	-3.6294
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a replacement .	-2.9781
But when a blade is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience fell very real sights .	-5.2063
Since 2005 civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to repair the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.6870
Nobody was ever accused of murder .	-16.6899
" It is really inconceivable that in all these years no one has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks who helped organize the post .	-4.8183
" It is a dirt spot on a story , but it is a burden for our souls . "	-2.7337
Brooks is a 71-year-old former member of the State of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist .	-2.7922
It serves as a dramatic call for action and an annual memory of the Monroe community is that a wrong has never been corrected .	-3.2727
" We want criminal prosecution , we want an end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , " he said .	-3.6962
'We cannot get to heal and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.2088
A court medicine puts a cloth on the body one of the victims of the Moore Ford Lynchen on 27 July 1946 .	-3.9898
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-3.1207
No one has ever been charged .	-1.4860
Although suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights activists say that double motivation for lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex in all .	-18.4428
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in the summer election campaign .	-3.1248
About the same time as the choice , according to the FBI , the black farmpower Roger Malcom stood a white property owner , Barnett Hester , during a battle - supposedly because of a woman .	-4.2067
Brooks said that the rumor was in the city that Hester slept with Malcom ’ s Mrs Dorothy , and that the baby she went down was not from her husband .	-10.9384
On 25 July 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , says the FBI .	-2.9487
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-1.8046
But when they removed from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob killed the car .	-3.0574
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders " that concludes a FBI report .	-2.9735
" It is also obvious that there was a complex between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered the identity of witnesses " . the of of the and the of .	-15.7351
Brooks formulates it even more concisely .	-2.6472
" It was an electoral law massacre , " he said .	-1.4497
" You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . "	-3.4187
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual reporting of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murder .	-2.8682
Their representation is illustrative , grasping and is based on a kind of deep racism , many want to believe that it does not exist in America any longer .	-4.5754
It is hard to watch and look even more difficult , but Greene said that this is the point .	-2.8578
" We do not want to talk about the lynches because we are then confronted with their ugnity in all of us , " she said .	-3.7612
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I did " .	-2.9507
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day nearly 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed themselves into a space and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece .	-5.1455
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co director .	-1.1756
He has been playing the role of the chief clan member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-3.0904
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-2.0794
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times ' .	-3.0406
On the other hand of the room , Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-3.0003
The piece begins with Malcom , who attacks and urges him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-2.7534
'I said n -- he , disappear from my property ! '	-1.1793
Rascona returns the fire .	-1.9178
There is a break .	-1.0797
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) will break into smiles .	-2.9920
Greene laughs the loudest .	-2.0086
" What ? " , Rascona asked .	-1.7305
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.8259
Was I too hard ?	-1.5026
" No , " Greene said , still kicking .	-2.3805
" I simply do not believe that white people then said ' n -- he ' .	-2.6757
" But " , one of the other black representatives witnessed .	-2.5287
" You only have to meet the hard R. " .	-2.5102
And that is precisely where energy shifts in space , a sense of camera adventure replaces the unease .	-3.5912
Everyone is working to get this right , not only because of the game , but also because of memory of the four people killed .	-3.2171
The scene begins again .	-1.8031
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharp and strongly .	-2.4719
No one laughs absolutely anyone .	-2.2044
This repeat ends violently and quickly .	-1.8103
There are shots , shots and then silence .	-2.2993
A woman , dressed with a mourning dress , stands above the corpses of the actors and executes Billie Holidays dreaming lobby " Strange Fruit " .	-4.9952
Your voice breaks in every second word .	-2.0395
About a hundred meters behind it a group of about four dozen spectators wishes sweat and tears from the eyes .	-3.5112
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .	-1.5562
A couple arrived from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the road .	-2.6611
They have experienced Georgia 's depressing moisture every eight hours when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcom and Dorseys on a pilgrimage trip .	-5.1418
To this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now when one stands on the same country where the lynch murders took place , the air feels spensive .	-4.4191
When the last notes of the song come out , Greene invites a lot to come closer and inspect the body name .	-3.9480
Children lie up on their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent body and flushes to each other .	-3.9725
" They are not really dead , " murders a small boy as if he wants to remember it .	-3.3884
After a few minutes , Greene thanks the amount - and suddenly it is over .	-2.8715
The actors throw the lynchrope away and wipe their tears . the acthe actoraction .	-18.1483
Bradshaw embarrassed Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan meplayer .	-4.7568
Nick Rascona killed two of his fellow players and then crying together in her poor , the emotional burden of performance breaks with him .	-4.6687
" It is okay " , flushes one of the women .	-12.5792
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.3631
You did so for one reason ' .	-1.6359
Later the audience composes with the actors for dinner .	-2.9235
On a table , a white couple from Atlanta suggests that they have just met with a black couple .	-4.6958
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance .	-2.2977
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , " she said .	-3.1348
" What really does with me , let me believe that the lynch is still going on , " she added , " today it is called the police shooter . "	-4.6281
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof holds on his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights .	-14.1354
He said he started planning the performance next year .	-1.7011
" The submission is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the horrors of what we have suffered , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.3371
" It is so if we learn nothing from it , it can happen again .	-2.8656
Anyone who does not study his own history is condemned to repeat it . '	-2.8388
" Dawn of God " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth .	-1.8738
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf puts director on a bunt-frivole staging of gigantic , six-storey scenes .	-5.2188
The rotary stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) shows a shabby street corner , including wall rest and donerbude in Berlin , a " plastic and elastic " logo from DR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-4.7148
Before that , an open Mercedes-Oldtimer , in which the Rhine daughters position as rockergirls , or alternatively an Isetta .	-4.0329
Stacked oil barrels remember Castorf ’ s leitmotif - money , power , and greed - due to his " ring " staging .	-3.7919

The audience thanks the ensemble with powerful applause .	-17.1440
Stormically celebrated Foster , Milling , Vinke and Conductor Janowski , who modest and formally hid the hands of the Merkel Raute .	-4.3076
Great applause exists for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - given the big heat again in empty leisure clothing .	-5.2470
The presence of Frank Castorf and his regional team was expected to be exciting .	-17.0752
He had still to leave a successful arrow concert over himself in 2013 , five years later , there were big jubles in which the individual " bow " calls were called called .	-8.4631
Head of Festival Katharina Wagner is likely to have welcomed this .	-3.7463
" One notices that the audience had grown up with the " ring " in a way , " she said just before the performance of dpa .	-4.7697
The audience has not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but it is also an understanding of its view .	-3.3575
I draw a positive response .	-2.3399

Fortuna 's Hoffmann : ' Three-chain works better '	-2.6727
Andre Hoffmann hopes , after the 2 : 2 season beginning against Braunschweig , that the optimization of defense formation will lead to eye points .	-4.4323
With the first season game Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the result , there would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-3.4079
" These were two opponents too much , and we need to be careful in Aue " , says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-3.8093
The triangle is to be further optimized in the archbishop .	-4.0072
And a gate for a free girl doesn 't want to enter the fortunes anymore .	-4.9946
" For the future it will be that no longer sets itself on the line next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-4.1529
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better off after the experience of preparing the triangle than with the four-chain .	-4.2763
" Yet I don 't know how we will act in Aue " , says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause " because we have just in the triangle at the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gießelmann players who can build well " , said Hoffmann .	-5.5542
" It is a prerequisite , but that we are harmonising even better and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction process . "	-17.7649
Of course Hoffmann will also go to Aue to win the game .	-3.0306
" Whether you can speak after a decision on a failed start doesn 't know .	-3.2314
The performance could well be okay , " said hopman .	-2.5857
" But if we stand with four points on Sunday and focus on the pocal , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal start . "	-5.0113
His coach did not want to know anything about this .	-2.7194
" I judge the start in the season only after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who doesn 't want to speak of an advantage over eye just because the game of Saxons in Heidenheim had to be aborted prematurely because of a weather .	-5.2813
" Now they can start the season quasi with a home game " , said Funkel and Hoffmann believed that the players from Aue might even be somewhat fresher , because they had no difficult and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones .	-5.6057
" But they do not know so much where they currently stand , " says the interior defender of Fortuna .	-3.0801
Guests from the Rhineland , as a light favorite on Sunday , go to the meeting in the final ( almost ) manufactured stadium of Aue .	-4.5609
" That we discard them just because we are entitled to come under the first six is bloodness , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet at only one defeat from nine games is very positive .	-6.4970
" There is no team in the second Bundesliga to beat from the outset , " Fortunas Chefcoach explains .	-21.0069
'To make such a statement would be arrogant and overwhelming ' .	-2.9438
So Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday .	-3.0040
New results of Swedish asylum assessment tests	-2.2106
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have undergone a new method of evaluating their age , show that more than 80 % of the tested persons are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of those results .	-19.7817
The Swedish Authority for Forensic Medicine ( Return Medicinal Verket ) has begun to carry out the tests last year .	-17.2432
They are intended to clarify the assessment of age during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration authority ( migration ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugein part . the not the the of the in the of .	-23.2622
Until today , migration verket 6.880 has sent to test cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-3.6686
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) was judged as 18 or older , while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-2.9533
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person ' may be under 18 years old ' .	-2.6139
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-2.6020
According to Johan Göransson of Forensic Medicine Agency , the results of recent months are constant .	-2.8429
" We see no major difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are quite constant , " he said the journal The Local .	-3.2811
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.0110
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that ' suggest that the investigated person was 18 years or older ' .	-13.8742
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladt examined the 581 results published , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person was frankly told that she would be 18 years old this year .	-3.7299
The method of medical age evaluation , in which X-ray recordings are made by wisdom teeth and MRT photographs of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-5.1985
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work covers evaluation of human biological maturity to see whether they were used sooner or later as usual by puberty .	-17.1325
" I had reason to think about this and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.5155
This way of judging the biological age is very uncertain .	-3.0358
If we cannot say it securely , we should not do as if we could , " he said to the Metro newspaper .	-13.2390
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of an adult assessment is incorrect .	-3.6580
The biggest risk is when the person is barely less than 18 , in this case this is about 10 % . '	-4.3569

On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meters bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-3.4512
That is what the pedestrian path should be .	-3.5107
This is particularly because it is completed parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-3.7617
The other two bridges are already patented bridge caps .	-1.6526
Special fingertips required the laying of lines by the construction work in Lauterbach .	-4.1372

The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 .	-2.1202
The country as a whole is financed .	-2.5574

He said it is sorry for " all athletes who have been snapped away from gold and silver medals in competitions " .	-4.5342
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report from the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) had found references to state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-15.6556
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAF President Coe the reporters .	-13.6275

These included Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the general spectator of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-12.9241

The man of the Danish queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-2.7730
The Königshaus announced on Thursday .	-3.0061
Traditionally the Danish queen couple is served in the church of Roskilde .	-4.4467
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already produced a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.1573
The queen was in agreement with the decision of her husband , it continued in the communication .	-3.5471
Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is still unclear .	-1.9483
He did not intend to be set up in his French home .	-2.8320
Prince Henrik had never made a hide of not happy with his title .	-2.8304
He would like to become king after his wife Margrethe ascended in 1972 .	-4.2298
In 2016 he went to retirement and also put the title " Prince Mahl " .	-4.3662
Since Henrik in Denmark did not receive the title and function he wanted to see himself as equal to his wife - not even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief spokesman of the Danish King House .	-4.9932
Where the last retirement of the 83-year-old will ultimately be unclear .	-3.7314
He did not intend to be held in his French home , but in Denmark .	-2.8146
He may be the country for which he has worked over the last 50 years .	-2.4300

Prime Minister Weil wants rapid re-election	-1.4296
CDU and FDP before the possible majority in Lower Saxony	-2.3486
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister , Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country , but he does not want to resign after the loss of the red-green majority .	-3.5249
Because on Friday Parliament advocated resolution .	-3.0366
Previously , the surprising exit of a Green MEP from her country group in Lower Saxony had overthrown the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.4276
Five months before the official election date , the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its scarce one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.7315
Elke Twesten , the Green MEP , took her step with the nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg .	-4.5162
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained in Hanover on Friday .	-2.0870
CDU Group leader Bjorn Thümler wants to recommend it to his group .	-2.6761
CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Landday , SPD and Green 68 seats .	-3.1630
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-2.6158
The new country day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-1.6532
Thümler said that the red-green national government must now decide whether they can continue to govern in this situation without a majority .	-3.3344
However , Stephan Weil believes it is essential that the country 's own resolution be decided as quickly as possible .	-22.9713
The CDU Group is likely to decide on Tuesday its follow-up .	-2.9455
The country ’ s Constitution also provides for the possibility that the country ’ s day will withdraw Prime Minister ’ s confidence and choose a successor .	-19.5641
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.2201
Thümler said that these opportunities must be examined in a clean manner , " said .	-4.6447
'You will be quiet when you have a reasonable check on the matter ' .	-4.7170
Thümler called Twesten 's step " yet a little curios " .	-2.7561
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.0848
I feel very good ' .	-2.3299
She was a black green supporter .	-2.4347
The Greens asked the dissenting Members to return their country mandate .	-2.6577
" We assume , of course , that she will return her country mandate , which she has received through the green country list with immediate effect " , shared with the country leader Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-4.6630
The Chairman of the Greens Anja Piel said : ' We regret the decision by Elke Twest extraordinarily ' .	-3.3588
You have deliberately chosen not to hold a debate in the group .	-2.5925
'Even against the background that there were no differences in substance , we cannot understand this step ' .	-3.1108
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the entry of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Twesten to the CDU as a treason .	-3.6018
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only treason to voters , but also treason to Red Green , " the Chief of Social Democrats wrote on Friday at Facebook .	-4.0130
He supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly re-elect the country day .	-2.7167
Twestens exit Red Green in Lower Saxony costs the majority .	-2.6535
Politicians " in their injured frustration , and in their frustration , criticized Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.8450
" It is a scandal that the CDU participates in lower axes in this dirty intrigence game and tries to beat political capital from it " .	-17.2633
Lower Saxony 's Chief of Democrats , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend his Members to include Elke Twester in the CDU .	-3.9219
The leader of the Socialist Group in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , imagined that Twesten , with personal career thinking , falsified the outcome of the 2013 country election .	-5.1650
At that time , the CDU was strongest in front of the SPD , SPD and Greens had a very thin majority of one voice in rural areas .	-4.5039
Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisoning , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.5800
Germany discusses contaminated eggs .	-1.5222
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.0196
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.7206
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is interviewed with the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-3.1353
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.1775
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp impression .	-2.5695
On the consumer protection portal www.foodstuffs warnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the egg charges concerned .	-4.7113
Egs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.5968
Even if , after all we know , a health risk is virtually excluded .	-3.0416
Does Aldi now take the best possible response - all eggs out of offer - because the central role of the Enlightener is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture ?	-4.0659
Food surveillance is a task for the federal states .	-2.3467
Nevertheless , my house has turned up immediately and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it is known that Germany has been affected .	-5.1690
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.1398
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are traffic and healthy .	-3.6200
If eggs exceed 0.005mg / kg , they are unable to travel .	-3.6379
However , unburdened eggs can be sold and consumed .	-2.0231
This time , farms are not to blame .	-2.3723
Is production companies and consumers on the same boat ?	-2.9173
According to the current level of knowledge , production companies are not directly blamed .	-3.4974
Rather , they must expect economic damage because of the illegal practices of service companies .	-2.8883
As always , there is too little controllers in case of seriousness .	-3.5456
Is there a lack of staff or competence ?	-3.7174
It was precisely the official controls that discovered the process .	-3.7383
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .	-2.3942
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent education of such events and the handing over to the public prosecutors is of crucial importance in cases where crimes can be made .	-5.2355
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to be fully informed .	-2.9443
Is the regular alarmism really necessary for food scandals ?	-2.3380
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and efficient food .	-3.0349
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.7388
The panched means have brought manufacturers , traders and consumers into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .	-4.2958
Basically , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticide fipronil in the attitude of food supplied animals is unacceptable and must be ended immediately .	-4.1680
This must be done consistently at all levels and with high pressure .	-3.3746
I look forward to all the competent authorities to ensuring that the situation is rapidly and completely informed .	-4.7144
How to affect football ’ s financial rules on Neymar ’ s move to Paris	-2.5898
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris Saint Germain .	-3.1428
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that monitors the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-3.3657
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must eventually prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-3.8635
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of his treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several million dollars per year .	-2.8292
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France .	-1.4515
PSG can certainly make money easier to sign Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energy rich ruler family of Qatar .	-4.2907
Associations may spend a great deal of money to purchase players , but they must control with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to make the Break Even point in their football business .	-5.1572
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA president in 2007 .	-1.7999
Former French players believed that associations that had succeeded in seeking enormous debt cheated effectively and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdraw their support .	-3.9052
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.3503
The change meant that the business model , which originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand , should become a tougher issue .	-3.5898
During the current three-year FFP investment period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept EUR 30 million .	-2.6109
And , although Platini 2015 has fallen into disgrace by the presidency , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to fight to deter excessive expenditure .	-13.9105
" Of course , FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future " , said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , in relation to The Associated Press last week .	-3.7334
Although the PSG paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat rate , it may distribute the amount for the invoice over the duration of its contract .	-3.9465

The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , took the most serious sanctions .	-3.2604
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) that was reduced to EUR 20 million later - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 player .	-4.1295
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by blowing up their revenues by club owners .	-4.0261
While a catarian company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsoring exceeds standard market rates , UEFA would not be regarded as legitimate income .	-3.5551
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA ’ s sponsorship was bloated by Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.0833
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the World Cup 2022 Organization Committee .	-4.0625
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed the fact that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators .	-4.3726
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observing any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.7911
UEFA did not have preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar ’ s Transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-27.7476
They spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.8773
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with sales of EUR 542.4 million , gained more than EUR 10 million .	-2.9026
The accounts for the last financial year must be published .	-2.2895
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising and tricot sales .	-2.7348
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-2.9095
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players , and she tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would infringe the FFP .	-3.0653
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to Catars the ultimate ownership of PSG .	-3.6007
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-2.9137
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.2805
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.4517
It will be very difficult to respect the Financial Fair Play , because one can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-3.8227

Now sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline is rewriting its mission .	-3.4678
Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request from the News Agency sda a a corresponding report from the Northwest Switzerland newspaper on Friday .	-3.4182
In accordance with current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.1936
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and would be subject to quality control .	-2.7916
" With the current supplier Chocolat Frey we are very satisfied " the speaker said .	-2.2221
Around 17 million small , red-white packaged shoggital boxes to 14 grams per year distribute passengers before landing to passengers .	-20.2776
The cost was not to provide information about the swiss .	-2.5540
Industry insiders appreciate the order volume of " Northwest Switzerland " to Francs 1.5 to 2 million - the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around one billion Francs .	-13.4080
But more important is the advertising effect : it is a prestigious order for a shogging manufacturer .	-3.2812
As many candidates have in the new tender procedure , Swiss does not want to be betrayed .	-3.8525
But only Swiss manufacturers come into question .	-1.7948
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey intends to try to renew the Treaty beyond spring 2018 .	-2.6252
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.2998
Since 2006 Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board of their flights .	-2.6230
Before the Swiss concluded a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had delivered the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug .	-2.6120
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.2824
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-1.9827

Nostalgia is in " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " in the Nissan Nish	-3.2386
This repetition of history is also nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-year grunge era ( when the foreseer David Wain and Michael Showalter rotated the sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things .	-17.2463
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and embodiment of our Facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-2.9144
But as a franchise , it feels as if the time was short .	-3.0175
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking dose of vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.0289
By climbing at the heart of the gag - actors of middle-age play hot children who will grow up - they nevertheless created the impossibility of winning the last part of the joke .	-12.6704
" Ten Year 's Later " , with his adults who are now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the cast knowledge principle , including a reef to the stalker films of the 1990s like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ) .	-5.5853
On one point , an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates , and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.9450
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.0529
The lovely coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now novel author , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.7217
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost its virgin .	-2.5044
And there is another malignant plot that is included in the Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a very successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.6737
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.3220
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillon ’ s sub-lippenbart of " Singles " , whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-14.8863
It is the moments random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Year 's Later " , whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.8257
" Comrade Detective " in Amazon now reminds us of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its east-gene-west ring iconography .	-4.1010
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism .	-4.1203
The main roles - a hard-collected gregor and an idealistic iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-3.6025
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.0175
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.2320
There are some beautiful gags to reputate ( police spend time looking at chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-3.8968
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - provides a decent game ' Find out the voice ' .	-2.5866
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.3453
With six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or frequently enough .	-3.3250
" Comrade Detective " , which has been conducted on a lengthy length , could provide its agitprop-satire better , since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American Embassy whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who squander a cluster of Hamburg .	-5.8171
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a feed .	-2.7223

Battle against Drug Mafia in the country	-2.2780
The police have succeeded in fighting the Italian Mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-21.3097
On Wednesday morning in the Black Forest Baar district , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , numerous objects were searched , as the prosecutor communicated Konstanz on Friday .	-4.4349
At the same time , 15 accusations were arrested between 25 and 77 years and were already issued against them .	-5.3576
In addition , officials secured larger quantities of marihuana and cocaine , shooting weapons and several hundred thousand euros .	-2.8859
Two people were arrested at simultaneous racies in Italy .	-3.1875
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects in Italy .	-2.3932
The two will probably be delivered to Germany .	-2.3499
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-1.5096
Overall , over 300 police officers were in operation .	-2.2612
Mafia members are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , tempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-3.3950
Since summer 2016 , the prosecutor has been investigating constance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.6592
Between the public prosecutors in Constance and Palermo , there was a staggering exchange and investigators of Cripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily . the the of and the the of the of . the of the	-14.4727

Italian citizens were closely related to the Italian mafia in particular to the investthe tests .	-29.8343

Major gaps in the Foreign Register	-2.3021
" Data from citizens who should not emerge there " : a report shows significant shortcomings in Germany .	-4.0619
This leads to serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-2.0832
The Representative for the Federal Government ’ s management of refugees , Frank-Jürgen Wise , has drawn attention to a media report , according to a large gap in the foreign central register .	-12.4794
Failings in the data registered there could lead to partial serious mistakes in asylum procedures and deportations , in an analysis presented by the " Southern German newspaper " .	-18.3158
According to the register , ten million people are involved with foreign nationality , including some 5.7 million people from non-EU countries .	-32.5432
The data are therefore managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.5201
Because the data was not sufficiently maintained , the data quality has not been good in parts so far .	-4.0468
In individual cases , data was found in 1921 , " by people who have long since been no longer alive , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer appear in the register " .	-5.3955
" Incorrect data inputs can slow significantly from return processes , " the report continues .	-5.0252
Moreover , statistics about adequate people are covered by EU citizens who do not need to travel .	-4.1255
Such incorrect assignments , however , led to ' a distorted debate on the management of travellers ' , that is , in analysis .	-5.5497
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun sending refugee families back to Italy with children under 16 years of age when they arrived from there .	-3.9580
This is emerging from an internal paper of the Federal Office of Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the New Osnabrücker Zeitung .	-12.2698
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has been re-engaged in Italy since 1 June 2017 on families with children - with the exception of infants and micro-children .	-5.4412

The Dublin Agreement is responsible for the refugees of the EU state which they reach first .	-3.9747
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country of entry .	-2.8881
To explain , the Office is now writing : " Meanwhile , the reception capacity for families with minor children in Italy has increased substantially .	-5.0370
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.2181
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECMR ) considers these commitments sufficient .	-2.1363
Other EU states would also send refugees there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.2816
The domestic spokesman of the left-wing group in the Bundestag , Ulla Yelpke , criticised this decision : " families with children are threatened because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights conditions and a threat to children 's well-being . "	-5.2246

" It is genius how our body is built for it and we pay respect to the donors who make their blood available to foreigners , still unusual , " emphasized mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.2161
" A single donation helps several people " , explained the Deutsche Red Cross ( DRK ) distributor , Holger Maisenbacher , because the conserves are dismantled into their components .	-5.4012
For example , three people could benefit from a blood donation .	-2.7275
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported the actions taken in Oberreichenbach in spring .	-3.4067
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK Preparatory Leader .	-3.2245
Obviously , the change to the Theatre House just a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-3.4785

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.0627
The Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakened speculation over an increase .	-3.2153
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " bearing " when it kept interest rates on family incomes at the heart of increasing pressure .	-3.2947
The Bank ’ s policymakers , with 6 to 2 , voted to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking to rise this month , as weak economic growth weakened support for increasing .	-4.3224
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation likely to rise to around 3 % in autumn .	-3.6566
But it signalled that in the next few years , raising interest rates would be necessary to rein the inflation fueled by Brexit , saying that credit costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.3047
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut Economic Recovery Package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.4955
It will call for the financing plan to allocate cheaper financial resources for banks from next February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the scheme - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .	-4.7420
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the central forecast of the MPC , GDP remains weak in the short term , since pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption . '	-4.3518
As regards interest rates , it reiterated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would require cooling inflation and a ' slightly bigger ' extent than the markets expect . , , h, the , , the , the , , the , , , and , the , the the the	-18.1564
Markets are currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.7312
The Bank stressed , however , that increases would be ' step-by-step ' and ' limited ' .	-2.0980
The Bank ’ s downward growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % projected in May and 1.7 % .	-3.3955
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.9942
The pound fell to the dollar and the euro after these news .	-2.4107
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .	-1.7992
The decision does not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of interest rates , and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .	-21.8890
Growth will probably be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year .	-3.3003
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by increasing inflation and slight increases , since the tightening first becomes worse before it improves .	-4.5967
She added that monetary policy could not ' prevent income collapse in the next few years ' , but it added that wages will recover " clearly " at the end of their three-year forecast .	-4.6983
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate part of lower consumer spending .	-3.1688
The decision comes one year after the reduction of interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s decline to .	-18.5074
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until it fully achieves prices and the economy .	-2.7936
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the reputation for an increase in interest rates was rising , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers in July demanding an increase to 0.5 % .	-4.5406
Last month , inflation dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , despite the fact that the Bank said that this was expected and will attract it back in the coming months .	-3.9136
The Bank said that exceeding relative to its 2 % target was " entirely " to the weak pound .	-3.6893
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as creditors are looking for business loudly and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.6033

NHS ( National Health Service ) is intended to write 10,000 people in disputed HIV drugs .	-14.3582
Patients will receive access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September following a struggle before the high court against finin the NHin .	-28.1549
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylax ( PrEP ) before sexual traffic , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now being supplied by the health service by an initial three-year study estrisk of 10 0risin high.	-17.8093
He agreed to fund the process after last year 's appeal court confirmed a judgment by the Supreme Court of Justice that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP , despite claims that local authorities should finance it .	-3.8913
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chairman Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as a " crucial moment " .	-17.2632
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be the first to enable people to register and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.0690
Preexposition prophylax ( PrEP ) is a result of HIV preparators taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-17.0886
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces the HIV transfer of infectious dangers .	-2.8575
Taking PrEP before sexual traffic means that there are enough drugs in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-3.3755
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual trans.	-21.7845
Those who call into question the treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.2905
The clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.2692
People living in England and registered with a doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-3.2950
The program will sign <unk> 10 million and NHS England a contract to supply medicines this week after international competitive procurement .	-3.2252
The study is intended to assess the whole potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-3.9373
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.4083
It is another milestone in the progress that persists over three decades in managing one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind . '	-23.1259
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.6017
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.1723
From September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .	-4.0036
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.1830
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to ensure that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that nobody who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-3.7135
Now that PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV infected people . '	-2.9742
Sharon Hodgson , Sharon Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitant implementation by the government .	-2.6937
The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention , and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-13.0037
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-1.6634
It is important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible in the country as possible to protect people who are HIV-infected and that it will help us to bring a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society .	-4.5439
Large life : Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have transformed these little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.2582
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.3222
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their pockets .	-14.1575
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-2.0995
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-1.7371
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.2271
I loved them and made an offer this day . '	-2.3196
Since the first visit the 1,000 square feet has been completely overtaken .	-2.8697
Originally a single property with a neglected layout - one had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Staurant and an intermediate floor to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .	-5.3121
" I wanted high ceilings , big windows , a lot of light .	-2.0963
That was my requirement , " she says .	-1.3681
For this purpose , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill , to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne . . the a in the the the , , and , , , the , the the the the the the and	-18.0216
The ceiling was not big enough to place two rooms together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate stage in which one could face .	-4.1535
He had to think creatively to resolve the target .	-3.4856
" The steel work is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.1982
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked together without having to pick ourselves up .	-4.8519
Not only was it a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function at the top or below . '	-12.3724
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with much more drama .	-3.1282
A classic copper light window from Retrouvius downloads over the glamorous living area .	-3.5342
Mixed gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.2401
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .	-1.6528
In both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer .	-3.4160
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.1699
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all connections and glasses of Joanne .	-3.7339
By perceiving a more glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen unless it is used .	-3.4278
Cooking cooking is nothing new .	-3.4974
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.4167
" A little engineering art went into there , " explains Erfan from the steel reinforced , furnished MDF door .	-3.0896
'It is balanced , so it is very easy for you to move the door ' .	-4.6970
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne could win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-2.9780
" At the end of the day you will sell the basic area - or how your property is estimated " , says Erfan .	-3.0024
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate broker will enter and calculate based on the ground size " .	-3.5455

Brothers are fighting for US $ 500 million in real estate empires	-2.2266
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a debate because of one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.4640
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors from his recent brother Paul , bringing him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be distributed .	-3.7127
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion of the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-12.4542
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a deal in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.1236
There the Westco Jeans family founded and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.6758
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .	-1.6190
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , developing areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , as well as shopping centres in the Management Centre .	-3.6085
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin , described by Paul as the " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family , is about two-thirds of company assets and Paul , about a third .	-4.7770
A court act states that this means that Colin has $ 316 million worth of $ 176 million worth of dollars .	-2.9044
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.2745
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidavit .	-2.5446
Last Friday , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place after several failed conciliations .	-19.4741
The brothers are now also fighting for control over the existing business - Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out him .	-3.4422
Colin argues that this is not true , but rather accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetent .	-20.4612
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-2.0934
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority " , he wrote .	-2.1470
The costs are rising in the case , with hundreds of pages containing affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-12.6646
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants who operated milkbars and delicate business from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a deal in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.6039
They used the security to buy the collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansloads of the family .	-3.0839
Colin says that he began there when he was " in my last years the high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.3676
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property friendly to their sons .	-2.4676
" Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brethren to go to court " , she wrote .	-2.1310
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group of companies , claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke $ 26 million .	-3.5359
Both Lukas and Mark are , Paul says , ' has been bittered about the conditions of their financial separation ' .	-14.6343
Colin was very reticent , although he was a former AFL board member and , after a biography from 2015 , by Eddie McGuire , the best friend of the TV star .	-16.5731
Fairfax Media took contact with Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.5022
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-2.6380
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.4830
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .	-2.5625
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-2.5152
On Friday , this hope seemed to be over .	-1.8016
" Our matter will be solved by the courts in the near future " , Colin wrote .	-2.1207
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.1018
Others tried and failed .	-0.9202
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-1.3782
If so , he will be the first .	-0.7266
Politico reports that the new White House Chief of Staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the chief on a more even-handed course .	-3.6182
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.4557
" When John F. Kelly , the new Chief of Staff of the White House , met with senior employees on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wants to repair : poor information that comes into the hands of the president .	-4.6384
Kelly said to the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in Briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had good information . '	-4.1552
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media .	-1.6851
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.5751
" When Trump was angry because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts to be convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February about politico .	-3.7408
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a steady praise . '	-3.0016
Okay .	-0.5430
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit ever was “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.7806
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions . not .	-18.1614
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.1660
If his colleagues managed to keep trouble away from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .	-4.6311
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from generating controversy .	-2.0564
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-3.7819
Politico - quite dealing with this history - reported in May on the preference of consultants to give dubious information to the President for strategic reasons .	-3.9730
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.3461
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he claims to find out where they come from .	-3.3234
That is what happened at the end of February , when somebody willingly accused the president of being a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the source behind a bunch of leaks in the White House .	-4.9329
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence , or that he made mistaken accusations in the past and revoked them .	-4.2154
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh . '	-2.2916
Goldmaker added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , ' tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper scram received Trump .	-3.5798
How did this fold ?	-2.0554
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .	-1.1214
Perhaps he will prove to be a priebus more effective manager , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-2.8233
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.1743

Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millionary Series '	-3.1812
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travellers at war foot who negotiated a tomb drawn from the town to demand a field before their manor houses .	-5.8587
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , called the " Millionary series " .	-3.1410
They have brought horses , babies and an army of transporters until they were designed in May , without being discouraged by a tomb excavated by the Council in order to prevent their incidents .	-5.2052
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pressed its vehicles by a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.3045
Angry inhabitants have urged the Solihull Council , saying that it is ' useless to address the problem ' .	-16.3384
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They drew there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath where they thrown stones on the passers-passers. .	-20.5114
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-2.7355
Travellers were there in May , continued and are back now .	-2.7054
More arrived last night , probably today . '	-2.0985
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to handle it by keeping long instructions to protect their parks .	-2.6483
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot even stop this . '	-23.9707
A resident who did not want to be called , said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers , only to be plundered by another round .	-3.9026
The numbers have increased this time and we have even seen a horse in the parking area ' .	-3.2394
A Solihull Council spokesman said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work together with the Solihull police , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move ahead as quickly as possible .	-4.8429
To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior with the police by calling 101 .	-3.2485
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-3.1403
Waldhotel Luise is from Birkenhof	-14.0052
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise becomes .	-2.5627
The house will be renovated in front of the gates of Freudenstadts and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.2744
These are good news for the city .	-1.7716
Because the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH as of 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 nights were lost per year and revenues were also lost by the curtax .	-5.4442
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the countryside , the hotel building was offered to the Board as a collection atmosphere , causing controversial discussions .	-5.1417
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a construction plan to secure the area as a location of the hotel .	-3.9355
At that time the decision was not uncontroversial in the Council .	-3.0202
However , in particular , pleasure stadts Upper Mayor Julian Oswald defended the location and spoke to the house at that time of serious interest .	-5.3499
He should be right .	-1.5895
The group Luisenhotels with managing director Birgit Scherer , located in Bad Bergzabern , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-4.9851
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object .	-2.4082
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.2893
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.4006
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it is clear what extensive renovation work is being done .	-21.4860
The floors were extinguished , ceilings partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-3.9010
The entire hotel is a single building site .	-2.3242
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.8447
" It 's really a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.5127
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-1.5819
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is changed and new windows are built .	-3.9834
Everything should be ' beautifully close ' later , as Thomas Scherer says .	-3.7360
'We want to make a jewelry out ' .	-2.1626
Swimming pool , wellness area and meeting rooms are equipped with all facilities .	-4.2221
One doesn 't want to position itself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but already at a high downtown level , Scherer emphasises .	-5.3989
The Forest Hotel Luise , with its approximately 60 rooms , widely explains Scherer .	-4.3513
Both individual holidays , groups or businessmen should feel comfortable at the hotel .	-3.7151
Talks with OB Julian Oswald and director of tourism , Michael Krause , he has already held Scherer .	-3.7411
The ideas of the city are equal to those of the Hotel Group .	-3.2315
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.2782
When asked about investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to define himself precisely .	-3.6766
Just under one million euros , he is expecting .	-2.5376
The outdoor facilities are also brought on front , and this is already clearly visible .	-4.3797
In an inner courtyard a large terrace will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .	-3.3528
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.3428
Russia affair : US Special Enterprise uses Grand Jury	-2.4410
In the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump , special investigators Robert Mueller should have used a Grand Jury after a report .	-3.4269
The body has taken up the work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " on appeal to familiar persons .	-28.0533
The newspaper assessed the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations .	-2.5917
The Sender CNN reported that there were already first submissions of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-18.1869
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of interfering specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-3.3695
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-1.5407
The focus of the investigations should be on several men who acted in the election campaign as advisor of the Republican .	-4.1705
According to reports , Mueller also reported more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment under the lupe .	-2.8711
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that Trump ’ s special investigator had personally gone to the centre and investigated the accusation of whether the president might have hindered justice in the wake of the affair .	-5.7281
The main task of Grand Jurys is to check this evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to charge it .	-20.7229
Grand Jurys are therefore also called charges .	-2.2020
They are usually turned on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-3.5192
The procedure is always behind closed doors .	-2.2781
The body can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to submit persons for interrogation under Eid .	-4.9640
According to the CNN sender , submissions have already been issued , around the encounter between Donald Trump and a Russian lawyer .	-4.0233
Persons involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement in the report .	-3.1922
Furthermore , they should provide documents .	-1.6207
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son Jared Kushner , and his then campaign chief , Paul Manafort , were also at the meeting .	-3.7389
Legal experts said on Thursday in the US TV that the installation shows that Mueller does not want to be intimidated in his work and that , if necessary , he wants to act quickly .	-4.9789
But it is not necessarily necessary to mean that the Grand Jury will be activated at the end to decide on the collection of an indictment .	-4.5119
Yet the setting up of the body is the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump .	-3.3483
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.8931
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.5063
The issue gives the Democrats a chance to feel ' well , because they have nothing else they can talk about . '	-3.7399
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , explained in an opinion that he knows nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.5423
But he also usually worked in secret , he emphasised .	-3.5348
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special investigator in a ' fair ' way .	-3.4697
Former FBI leader James Comey said three times that the president would not be determined .	-2.6200
There is no reason to think that something has changed , the statement continued .	-3.7982
But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey had fired . the the of . the of of of , , , , , , , , and the of of .	-16.2072
Because of this rubbish , accusations against Trump were loud , he wanted to hinder justice .	-4.8559
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-2.9707
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-1.8602
According to US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and its employees .	-3.0228
The speculation triggered whether Trump wants to release Mueller .	-2.1055
Unlike an independent Congressional special investigator , such as the Watergate affair for the later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could , in theory , be fired by the Ministry of Justice by the Ministry of Justice .	-4.1737
Several senators of both parties , however , want to prevent such a ste.	-3.4901
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented legislation on Thursday , according to which special investigators could no longer be released so easily .	-3.4427
Antarctic : Gigantian iceberg drives Antarctica	-3.2333
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg resolved from Berlin ’ s scarcely seven times size .	-4.5018
This announced the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday .	-2.5467
Over one trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres are now driving to the north , and will probably need two , three years until it is melted .	-5.1778
It has 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres of one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-3.6769
He does not run a threat to human beings .	-3.2834
To what extent climate change has played a role in the eruption of the iceberg is unclear according to research indications .	-3.5817
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for about 30 years , the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) writes in a fact background .	-3.8288
Many researchers believe that this can be connected with global warming .	-2.6911
The now broken coloss has been part of the Larsen C-Schelfeis .	-3.6859
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.0675
Thus it is growing into the sea and regularly breaks down .	-4.2880
The Larsen C Schelfeis is located in the south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.5175
North of this sleeve was the balance between growth and collapse a few years ago .	-3.7121
A complete schelfei was fallen there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.5825
There is a lot to say that the Larsen C sleeve is at risk , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-5.2333
Moreover , the ice plate is under tension and may fall if a key point crushes a piece .	-5.2900
Melting Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase the sea level , because they swim on the water and push ice so much water as it results after the melting itself .	-5.6696
However , the loss of the schelfeis leads to the fact that the glaciers can lead directly to the sea and flow much faster than before .	-4.8003
This could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a little extent , writes the British research project to observe the Antarctics ( Midas ) . not , however but also a low-to write dowabout the antthe of the .	-29.3833
The Larsen C Schelfeis , according to AWI data , with almost 50 000 square kilometres , is the fourth largest schelf of the Antarctic .	-4.9488
At the transition from mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-4.0100
There it disrupts regularly .	-2.9962
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice shield is now coming into a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-19.9398
" This is the broadest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.8789
Scientists were controversial about whether the Larsen C schelfei would grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.0988
But this development will take decades .	-1.3664
Even though these researchers fail to break this gigantic iceberg back to climate change , in the last few decades many of the iceberg of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen .	-5.7088
This long Antarctic summit goes in the direction of South America .	-2.6253
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-2.8316
The temperature rise has contributed to the decline .	-1.9209
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years , including the areas where temperature is most rapidly rising .	-4.1002
CDU wants house tariff for staff	-2.8804
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy free-growing bodies , the CDU is demanding to leave the employers ' association in order to become more attractive .	-3.9489
Just just before the summer break , Kreistag has raised 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.0007
More than 1100 employees and officials work for circle management in Mettmann .	-2.1261
Now 17 trainees are behind their first day of work .	-3.0144
The lessons in the circle seem to be very sought .	-3.6473
Around 620 applications have been recorded for the places to be sent this year .	-3.1132
Nevertheless , the circle lacks further staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks .	-3.3526
Currently , there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the Mettmann district .	-2.9411
Among other things , doctors and engineers are looked at as well as forces of general administration .	-3.5019
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , wants to take the initiative and oppose the shortfall of professionals in the administration in the course of rounds .	-6.3140
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration should draw up a concept of recruitment and staff development .	-4.5761
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals , but to counteract the shortage of applicants in the future , that is , to in the future . not only but the in , the in and in , , , but the in in the in the	-21.6191
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , show concrete measures for cross-beginners and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.5801
This sounds like a good approach .	-2.0932
Because the circle has to deal with staff problems that were not known earlier .	-4.6035
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-1.5004
The speech is about a genuine ' competition between the public employers ' .	-3.0893
In addition , a high number of employees who dismiss illness or ageing from the service will be rem.	-20.6904
So the maximum time to act so that no more jobs remain unoccupied .	-12.7779
But Klaus-Dieter peoples , the Chief of Group of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.8042
He recently caused a faust-thick surprise when he publicly challenged personnel costs and stunned the rest of the parties .	-5.2320
People want to see all the possibilities to leave the municipal employers ' association .	-3.9688
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the district management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with cities - should seek a house tariff " , people .	-5.5008
Thus , the CDU is trying to pay better the employees and officials than actually provides for the public service tariff forum .	-4.4158
The salaries are currently exactly required , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level oriented to professional years .	-4.3189
But the tasks of the circle have grown in recent years .	-2.4595
Only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be established where employees were concerned about the provisions of the new Prostitution Act .	-4.1670
Not least by the rising number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .	-3.2544
Italy tightens the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats	-2.1276
Italy has warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-3.5063
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work " , Interior Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-3.0019
Miniti ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German Youth Rescue Organization , because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.0170
The assistance organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian Prosecutor , Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.1712
" For us , and remains our top priority to save human life , so it is very sorry that we cannot at the moment operate in the search and rescue zone " , the organization said in an opinion on the social media .	-4.4715
" We cannot judge all the accusations currently made until we have collected all the information and evaluate the situation ' .	-4.1723
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Retet ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.4224
It is suggested that his crew take hose boat migrants on board who are directly supplied by traffickers and that the smugglers can leave to allow ships to be used again .	-5.2357
At least one such meeting was supposedly held only 1.3 miles from the Libyan coast , according to the acts of the Public Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.3914
The occupation is suspected of overseeing the authority of Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-3.2922
Under the code of conduct , boats like the Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .	-2.7786
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep to the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.4804
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , because they would not entail " substantial changes or disabilities " of their rescue operations .	-3.9376
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.2606
Miniti has meanwhile said that the number of migrants who arrived in Italy following the rescue measures has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.0612
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the minister said .	-2.2816
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-2.8203
Rise and Trial	-1.4102
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outdoor Post " and two host drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Palace to enjoy four days trials and sights .	-4.0997
Three friendly guides were available for this .	-2.8092
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours .	-2.5459
The Castle and Weinfest of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-2.2941
The first tour led to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-2.7032
The following views were followed , partly on towers , far from which one could look far above the forest and the previous layers .	-6.1263
In the meantime , longer and longer trials were rewarded .	-3.8780
On the second day , Bad Dürkheim went to the saline and the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-3.3511
Once again , viewpoint rose , combined with " flowering " trials and moderate increases .	-4.8241
Over the last two days , many heights have been scheduled again .	-14.2664
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refugees brought welcome breaks .	-2.3251
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers attracted healing sole in the outdoor inhalatorium .	-2.8471
New town was also taxed .	-2.2092

Console instead of Rases - Bundesliga is equipped for e-sport .	-3.0147
Do the sports stars seat in the future in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium rases in wind and weather ?	-5.3731
The fact is that e-sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages .	-3.8286
That is also the first federal ligaverns that are becoming increasingly involved in this area .	-5.2985
The beginning of 2015 , VfL Wolfsburg , later followed the FC Schalke 04 and last of all the VfB Stuttgart , founded an e-sports department in mid-July , and two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 underin . the the in and the the in the of in . the the	-15.0018
" We hope to enthusiastically create new young target groups for the VfB , " says Management Board Jochen Rö.	-4.0448
He is sure to " climb up several clubs on this train " .	-3.8718
Next weekend the Football World Federation FIFA in London will organize the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in which the games of various clubs will come together .	-5.3564
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.5276
Robin Dutt also has great potential in e-sport .	-2.0771
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-1.9637
" Real football must deal with the 14 to 30 years in particular , that the young people go into the stadium in the future , " says the 52 year-old .	-5.0634
And : the associations tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.2412
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , one could be much more present on these markets than just once a year to send the Federal Ligament to Asia .	-4.9628
What exactly is at stake ?	-1.7225
In e-sport , computer games like " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or even the FIFA football simulation are found at competitive level .	-4.2613
As in normal sport , leagues have long established themselves in which professionals compete with each other .	-14.6863
And in the 2022 Asian Games , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-2.3763
But is it a real sport ?	-2.2261
For many , the idea is certainly needed .	-3.0604
Ingo Froböse , too , has looked at the issue for a long time .	-3.5294
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that you find in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-4.4425
It also needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capability .	-2.3766
Professional gamers should train not only console but also their body and respect for diet .	-2.9910
" The fitter is a good player " .	-1.9907
However , Frobbish also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-4.3647
Checks are difficult to perform online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport .	-4.0006
The scientist highlights the high inclusive effect of e-sport .	-2.9340
Players travel internationally , this is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.2283
A study of consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts e-sport to grow rapidly .	-3.6211
In 2016 it was implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments .	-3.2505
Sales are expected to be at 130 million in three years .	-2.6222
That is little against the barely EUR 2.4 billion of the Football Federal League .	-3.6176
However , the e-sport " is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , write the Deloitte consultants .	-3.2423
Internationally , many countries are already on the way .	-2.1025
Large markets are Asia and the US , where ex-basketball players participate in Shaquille O`Neal and Baseball Star Alex Rodriguez in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.8139
Hollywood actors Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-2.5473
There is something in Europe , too .	-4.8821
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as an instructor , Frobösse says .	-3.2402
In the Netherlands and France , the Football First Liga Association , according to Dutt , is now committed to setting up an e-sport department .	-3.0481
" In European comparison behind Germany , " VfB Management Board of Röttgermann explains .	-3.8467
Falling only in nostalgia and clarifying the old days is no longer enough .	-3.1981
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but also of orienting the company in the modern market .	-4.1341

Michelle Carter convicted of the texts urging Conrad Roy to suicide	-2.8479
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two-and-a-half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicito be suicide .	-21.5190
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of its conviction behind grids and five years have been exposed to proof .	-3.6756
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .	-2.6496
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is intolerable .	-2.6742
My son was my best friend ' .	-1.0928
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-2.9092
She was confronted with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered a mental disease .	-2.6390
In red trousers and a creamy blouse dressed , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down eyes when it was convicted .	-3.9061
" Their actions killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.5668
" She ended his life to make their own better .	-1.9725
She took no responsibility , " she said .	-2.2738
" She has shown no repentance . " , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.5983
But Carters ’ lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance that she completely regrets ' .	-3.4523
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not discover that their ' age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant impact on their actions ' .	-3.8687
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy , saying that there is " no day on which I am not afraid the loss of my beloved son .	-4.2479
I would like him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything , and despite all my pain that we will carry with us for eternity , I am trying to be there for his sisters ' , that is , it . not , but .	-19.2582
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she was " persecuted " that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a tante for his children .	-3.8397
" Not having this only person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life " she said .	-4.2668
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide .	-3.0145

Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the New Mini Lahm of FC Bavaria	-2.7550
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run at the Audi Cup as a captain is no accident .	-14.9696
The FC Bavaria trusts the Confed Cup winner to a large season - extra motivation does not harm it .	-3.8300
Something else was different in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .	-3.8599
But since there was no Philipp Lahm on the second day of the Audi Cup , and no manuel new to see , he stopped the bond allocated to it .	-6.2024
" The trainer has not announced it " , told the Confed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavaria .	-4.0900
Well , the hand could have run better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.9449
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-3.6799
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player from young people , debutants and just from holiday professionals , but he was chosen .	-6.3120
Sugar is one of the best distributors to those who want to keep trust in rubber .	-6.1745
Anyone who was chosen to enter the heritage of lamb can only use a small extra motivation well .	-4.4829
Kimmich confirmed : " That is what you want to take responsibility as a player " .	-3.6602
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old fled the field as a mini-lady .	-3.9568
Right behind , this is now his position , the white bind on the arm did her .	-4.2945
And at all , Kimmich worked in this startup formation as the one who could best take the rudder into the hand .	-20.5923
He gave instructions to guide the unplayed force .	-14.7077
He had a look at the whole , while many others were involved in himself .	-4.0393
Vidal with overplaying his missing fitness ( fallen hardly ) ; Renato Sanches with devils coming from the achievements of the Asian journey ( fallen even conditioned ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle are not negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian trikot .	-7.4807
After all , it failed very well .	-3.6494
Süle ran beside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both were sovereign .	-3.3115
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult , and Süle also tried to build a few times successful in playing .	-4.7870
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result ' was not as we hoped for ' .	-3.7108
But he also showed a proper performance in the debut .	-2.5773
Relocation , Tempo change : " For this style I was also held " .	-4.6940
How unusual this Bavarian world is for new accesses , one looked after the game .	-4.3705
Rudy , for example , did not have one or two in the catacombs , but determines six or seven interviews .	-2.9377
Kimmich followed a few painful statements in the back of his new players .	-4.5392
He heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here I have already noted .	-3.3799

Company satisfied with the Minister of Rheinland Palace : Economy praises Wissing ’ s Tempo	-4.0490
It often became unusual , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Rhineland-Palatinate Minister of Economic Affairs in the world in the past .	-6.6761
This is demonstrated after more than a year when the new Economic Minister , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.5684

Frank Natus , chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy , which has blocked all of them " .	-4.1559
The biggest reverse is Natus in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country 's priority list .	-4.2960
Even this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , until 2021 , constructo stand .	-16.7431
A role in the country 's plans also plays a role in the Western circumvention of Trier , which is the primary needs of the Federal Transport Plan .	-4.6409
The goal is to start the route in December 2020 says Ministry Speaker Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.0639
Natus sees a signal to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.7565
The industrial and commercial Chamber ( IHK ) Trier seeks , as suggested by Wissing , a Rhineland palate label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been descending for ten years .	-4.9658
In addition , knowledge has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , the IHK praises .	-3.6070
The Chamber of Handworks Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new master bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-4.0477
A premium of EUR 1000 for the existing master examination and EUR 2500 when graduates become self-employed within ten years of master training .	-5.0024
But the homework list for the country remains long .	-1.8009
The planned road construction is fast to create facts , while at the same time it lacks the necessary personnel , Jan Glockauer says , IHK Trier ’ s prime manager .	-6.1242
Of 56 new engineers wanting to stop knowledge in the rural business of mobility , only 29 jobs have been filled so far .	-5.7347
The IHK calls for more contracts to external offices .	-2.1513
CDU group vize Christian Baldaf refers to the Court of Auditors ' calculations that the country invested more than EUR 20 million in receiving national roads than proposed in 2017 and 2018 .	-4.2328

Audi should change 850,000 diesel vehicles - Car manufacturers face a backlash of a backlash .	-3.0726
A day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.4577
The BMW chairman said that the company believed that ' there are smarter options than travel restrictions ' , referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based , to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-3.9208
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there would be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-1.9013
None of the companies described the undertakings as a withdrawal .	-2.6339
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.5507
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogenic and can cause asthma .	-2.3400
The cost of car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive . in , , , , the the the the the the the the the in of the the the of the of the of the	-20.6096

Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen at the beginning of this year , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emission rules in Europe , and a question focused on the United States has been expanded .	-4.1834
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavily burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.3977

Mordillos Collennases and Laughter against Silent	-4.0910
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawings , the bonus of his figures are his trademark .	-3.8690
Even with 85 the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-3.6239
His message : Laughter , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-1.7474
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.5211
In the first years as an artist , he succeeded as a drawing for congratulations cards , which frustrated him .	-4.5439
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-2.1495
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-14.9008
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.1144
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-2.7964
Large , round mordillo figures are found in drawings with the slave tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.2847
According to his own data in the early morning , he is still working on the drawing table , almost ten hours a day .	-4.3613
Through calendars , puzzles , books for big and small , T-shirts , plush animals and watches , his drolling figures continue to find a lot of spread worldwide over the world . in the the the of the and the of the .	-16.6130
For six years he has also worked on a sign ticket film and a TV series with his figures .	-3.8959
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand fillers as an opponent .	-4.1984
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie to enter the cinema screen in 2019 .	-3.2336
" I do not know exactly what they will say it is strange to me , " says Mordillo .	-1.9011
The script is not written by him .	-1.8411
That is why it relies more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced without wordless .	-3.8681
Threatened Provence ’ s Climate Change Lavender	-1.8682
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.1393
The lavender is declining because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases , which makes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions major headaches .	-4.5074
Eric Chaise , expert of the agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in the Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has suffered in recent years the effects of climate change , which brought much less rain in in the spring , and much more in autumn .	-5.3152
This affects the life of Lavendel .	-2.2057
There is also a small Zikade , a microbacterium transmitted by the dwarf cicades , and there are many of them at very dry weather . "	-4.6839
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.8214
Lavendell oil not only attracts holidaymakers , it is also very demanding for perfume and cosmetics . not only the but also the the best in .	-16.1503
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long flora tubes , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.1698
So we have less parts of etherical oil ' .	-2.9957
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing downgrading from the soil , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dryness .	-4.6844

The assassination of journalists underscores the growing threat in Mexico	-25.2395
Riodoce employees usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organised crime , corrupt officials and drug wars .	-4.2417
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .	-2.4722
They have been told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.8005
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children into the office , which were the goal of an attack with granates in 2009 or leave them home .	-4.7359
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-1.9532
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and belly feelings .	-3.9363
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen , journalists who are suspected to be on the government ’ s salary list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals making the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-3.1537
There is no rest break from the violence , and while the bodies are growing throughout the country , more journalists are there : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are according to attacks and threats under federal protection , and until now there have been at least seven deaths in seven countries this year .	-5.8314
Among the latter , its publisher and inspirer of Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas , is located .	-4.0219
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in relation to drugs .	-2.3553
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , showing his middle finger with the word " justice " , depends on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-4.9494
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters are discussing their shared topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-3.0915
Although a special federal prosecutor was built in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , it has only begun two criminal proceedings .	-3.8046
As with most thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely brought to justice .	-2.9027
In Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are undeniable and although the terrain is now even more treacherous .	-4.7876
Without information about the killers , without justice , the meeting on security has little use , Ibarra says .	-2.4983
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.6358
'Until we know why , we all suspect ' .	-3.1339
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the country capital of Culin the of the of the . the of and the of of of .	-18.4097
He only managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with " Twelfth River " .	-4.9060
The shelter went away in his car and damaged it near .	-3.2582
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.5844
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.1058
Rumors tend to fly around Culiacan freely .	-2.7375
But there is virtually nothing silence about Valdez .	-2.1429
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s most bloody battlefields , as rival groups struggle here to fill the vacuum .	-3.0115
It doesn 't matter that every day in Sinaloa someone or more people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for living .	-4.7183
Forget for one minute that there is a state of calm if only one cartel controls the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-3.5591
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , has broken with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .	-13.5552
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.2627
First , in February , an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-2.8325
This release may have angry the sons , suspected members bought each copy of the output once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.0073
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after confiscating another newspaper that had published the same story .	-2.9835
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.7772
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.1872
He worked in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he merged with five colleagues on the foundation of Riodoce and sold US $ 50 .	-4.5063
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the noise problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.6417
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.7329
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-core investigations without fear of censorship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else dared to treto .	-18.9282
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-2.5540
In the same year , Valdez won the Committee ’ s International Press Freedom Award for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-3.2770
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-2.0684
" I want to live on " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.5580
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.1362
" You must take on the task that you , as a journalist , have , either that or you play the dumb .	-5.1425
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.5485
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird who could flee like a port worker , the friend who was generous with embarrassment and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-4.1600
They familiar with his routine .	-2.1005
He would always bear his hat .	-0.9600
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar towards the office , and always sit on the same table .	-2.5982
Now they asked : did his love of routine his ruin ?	-3.1055
His death has also forced them to challenge their own assumptions about how best to do their work , while staying alive .	-3.5801
" You may not employ yourself with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runway and runway " to move drugs .	-4.2281
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-1.5685
The result , even in the best times , is a high level of self-censorship and self-conservation .	-2.4772
Its own instincts trust .	-1.8649
If it is wrong , it will stay away .	-3.2356
The trouble is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said , that ' smell a sense that can be misled ... and then the case happened with Javier ' .	-3.8868
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials at home .	-3.4189
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.5066
Riodoce ’ s staff met for security training were suddenly not allowed mobile phones ; days before , it was known that spyware sold to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-4.6266
Outside , two police seeked protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shade of a tree .	-3.0950
They were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class area of Culi.	-17.9564
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police who described the governor himself as untrusted .	-2.7161
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.2231
For this week 's output , Riodoce has looked at three main stor.	-16.1106
There was the murder of the brother of former known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.3372
They also had an exposé on government spending focused on the governor ’ s home city .	-2.6991
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block away from the office of the prosecutor . a not to the of .	-18.8079
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so there was caution when there was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local for drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.1064
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled almost all the century political levels .	-3.4132
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of high-quality cases of corruption .	-22.5065
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including a son of " El Chapo " Guzman deprived a military attack .	-3.8672
Just a few months earlier , the readers would have seen the Valdez column as the best informed source of kidnapping .	-3.1638
" In the past , we knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its small body stature .	-3.9242
'Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . '	-1.5437
The Valdez office became the storage room for characters and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they never expected : activists in the name of the press .	-3.8710
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and took a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-4.3925
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.4399
A burned body was discovered and civil servants say based on DNA tests that it is his .	-22.6633
In the whole country , journalists became louder by writing in organized " SOS Press " on paths and buildings .	-3.9884
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez .	-3.2951
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa a a day after the murder of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they said the truth .	-3.1172
Since then , it has asked that it be re-divided by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-3.2636
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organized crime , involved government officials and an indifferent society .	-2.8581
In his last book , " Narco-Journalism " , he wrote that reporters were killed not only by drug gangs , but also by politicians and security forces who were under a ceiling with organised crime .	-3.9396
The media guard group " Articulo 19 " assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials last year .	-3.0729
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.0534
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-2.0639
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-1.9982
Your body was found together with a note signed by the Zetas cartel : ' I am here for my reports ' .	-3.0920
A computer keyboard and headphones were in addition to their separate head .	-2.8720
Some branches have chosen to close , such as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.9314
Others continue , as Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.3543
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a guide on the front page heading " What do you want from us ? "	-3.5077
Some journalists have fled from their home countries , or even from the country .	-2.1691
It is a painful decision .	-0.7339
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.3510
And sometimes they are driven , as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who , in 2015 , was murdered in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.5618
For those who are lagging behind and continuing work , it is a daily dance with risky decirisk risk to dance .	-29.9410
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-2.1648
" Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I was reporter , " he said .	-2.3091
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Riodoce on the citizens ’ climb before the office and drink beer when all their phones began to sum up .	-5.9069
A series of shooters with bands rivals and security forces near the resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-3.1565
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-1.8605
From the stone edge , you have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-3.9277
The title page had to be changed on the next day .	-1.8265
Sirenen helped in the vicinity - another shooting in the area .	-3.0208
Bojorquez threw a look at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were ready .	-3.6856
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-1.7432

Researchers have now found that the initial findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner have been received so well that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of dinosaurs " .	-4.1843
It was so well preserved that they even found that his skin was rotary brown - and she said she had something of a " untroubled past " .	-5.9130
The report in the Current Biology magazine called it " the best preserved dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world " .	-3.5031
The fossil is a newly discovered kind of nodosaur , who lived in the middle of cycling between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.2778
Its incredibly well-preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it " really remarkable " .	-3.0780
According to reports in National Geographic , the tanked plant fresser is the best preserved fossil of his kind .	-3.2835
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was grub on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.5361
He met something that seemed absent from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.0722
He discovered Fossil in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.0967
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) of serious earthquake .	-3.6915
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.7404
" If you only blink a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen .	-4.0374
" It will go into the scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of dinosaur. "	-18.3063
Researchers have found that , although it is covered with an armor and similar to a changing tank , this plant freezer was likely to be threatened by dinosaurs who flesh flesflesh in the of the . the of the and the the of the of the of the the the of the .	-18.6585
The heavily targeted dinosaur used a red and white camera to hide before predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-shadow , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.9312
This would have allowed us to mix better into its environment and deviate from enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-4.7168
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.0644
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum Technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours carefully discovering it .	-4.0276
The surprising preservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and form of scales and armor over his body .	-3.6472
They discovered the intershadow , a common defense method in animal kingdom , which means that the tip of creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.7607
Although the shadow of control is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta is far exceeding the animals living today .	-4.7165
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by meat frustrating dinosaurs that evolution favored confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.9071
But most contemporary animals using contemporary animals - think of ripe , zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nodosaur was exposed to a real fight for survival .	-4.2423
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , strongly targeted dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the cred-time have been " , " said Brown .	-6.1391
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of dinosaur was redbrown .	-2.2254
Scientists continue to investigate the animal 's evidence of his life , including his conserved date to find out what it eaten as his last meal .	-4.3191
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was driven into a river and driven to the sea where he dropped on the back to the sea .	-4.1816
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further than they are today .	-3.4597
" This nodosaur is really remarkable , because it is fully covered with conserved skin , but also maintained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal " , said Brown .	-16.4322
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as it was in the early crying period . the the the the of the of .	-18.6814
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it , but if you only shoot a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is at sleep " .	-5.3973
Creating time was a time when huge theropods , fleshy dinosaurs who were on two legs pulled through the earth .	-4.6564
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the targeted dinosaur was driven by some of his dreadful ancestors .	-16.0583
This includes Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-2.5040
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology believe that Borealopelta was dropped in the sea after death and mumified in sludge .	-4.5743
The creature was found by Shawn Funk , when he grub on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.5862
According to the museum , it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the schnauze to the hip .	-3.9118
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.6235
It contained two 20-inch lengths leading from his shoulders .	-2.7632
The researchers believe that the targeted plant fresser was flooded by the Western Canada until a flooded river flooded into the open sea .	-3.6304
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserves its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.3997
The stoned remains of this special copy are received so well that the skin traces still cover holy tank plates along the dinosaur .	-5.0153
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto .	-2.5184
The more I see it , the more confusing it will .	-1.3611
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the holy plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-3.3627
His right front feet is on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .	-3.6383

In the Watter : Mass carambolage on A8 : Many Virtues	-4.2613
High accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-2.8240
There are numerous injured , kilometers long traffic and jaffer .	-3.9364
At the motorway Stuttgart Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass carambolage at a late Thursday afternoon .	-3.1067
According to the police , at 5.00 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg district ) during a storm , nearly 30 vehicles , including probably also lorries , were interconnected .	-5.7461
The exact number of injured people initially did not provide information .	-3.1760
It is easy to medium-sized injuries , a police speaker said .	-3.4525
A large choice of rescue vehicles was at the accident centre .	-3.8077
The A8 has been completely blocked towards Munich .	-2.2902
In Munich , a 10-kilometre long backstau was formed .	-3.9377
As an AZ reporter reporter reports , there were also massive disabilities at the risk railway - by numerous gifters .	-5.5121
The fire fighter noted the characters of the drivers who now have to expect sensitive penalties .	-4.3080
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.8121
There was a collision between car transporters and cars .	-3.2344
A helicopter was on the road to the accident point .	-3.1377
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests ' Comfort Check-in '	-1.3200
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing imaginable is sitting in the train and sleeping .	-3.8633
Or one is deepened into his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-2.8137
And then : puff .	-1.0515
Come the schaffner and arouse an imgent or tear the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-4.4551
Ticket control .	-1.6051
But the times of interruptions are over soon .	-2.7533
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing unscheduled ticket control .	-2.6552
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and devalue the ticket .	-3.6526
At present , one test operation is running on two routes .	-2.8735
" Comes the offer , we expand it .	-3.2741
It will probably be available on many other distance routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a rail speaker .	-3.9370
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train the ticket devaluation without schaffner .	-2.9626
In order to use them , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.1229
And you have booked an online ticket - and most passengers already do so .	-3.8168
You also have to purchase it through the App of the railway , the DB navigator , which is anyway the most convenient way of booking tickets .	-4.5529
Last but not least , a seat reservation is needed . a a a a a a a a . a a a a	-15.5478
Because the " comfort check-in " works like this : you get to the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.5743
A button for electronic devaluation appears in the test customers .	-2.7746
The train companions get a message to their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.1163
If the train accompanied by the ticket control at Platz Y he knows that a passenger is sitting there with already devalued online a tic.	-23.1970
So you can sleep , continue working , remaining silent .	-3.6663
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway , which is to use the passengers in turn .	-3.5501
" Those who wish to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying staff just check in the DB navigator themseland chin . not only . but a few tourspecific special offers . special offers are and .	-27.6598
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Far Transport .	-2.7323
Second Plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer requirements " .	-3.2271
Who often travels rail knows that , alongside delays and missed trains , the ticket controls are among the biggest angers .	-5.1477
Often you have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-5.1138
Either the credit card or the personnel identity card , or another document you have to show .	-10.1755
The result is endless discussions between passengers and passengers , which leads to poor sentiment in the department or large room and delays in controlling their own ticket , and the Schaffner finally takes time to take care of other concerns .	-5.7115
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-1.9529
Also on ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart Essen .	-3.0761
Other grant numbers on the same route are not yet available .	-3.8490
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-1.6408
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core .	-2.2568
Only one day after they arrived in New York City , the one in St. Louis was born on the bed of an Airbnb apartment which she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-4.4309
She stumbled over a post of someone from the High School .	-2.3697
" The police have just killed a 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " it was there .	-2.8988
Confused because nobody else had posted the information on their feed , closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.8479
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah has been constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-2.6150
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18 year-old killed by a white police in Ferguson , Mo .	-19.3820
He posted a picture of browns lively body that was extended on the street and would stay there four hours .	-3.8083
" That 's wild " , Ferrell thought about himself .	-3.2518
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.3997
She dismissed her mobile phone to return to tweets later on the Canfield Drive in the evening .	-3.4088
There were photos of the police band and people who wrote , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who went a sign with the label : ' Ferguson 's police have just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.8022
She observed a live feed in which a police stood before a group of demonstrators with a belling dog .	-3.6229
In another video , she said , another policeman unleashed his gun and scripted : " I will you ... animals all kill . "	-17.7363
" This is not common , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-15.7575
" This is not the kind of murder we used to and which we can call typical . "	-2.9531
I felt frost at this time .	-2.3605
I was angry and wine . '	-1.9459
It booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.6881
After landing at 23 a.m. , she retired from the house of her father 's father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-4.5840
What happened in the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11th century .	-2.7007
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , consisting of the people who live in the Community and have filled the streets to demand answers .	-3.4791
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , who went a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a talk that she had innumerable times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state « .	-5.0242
" You first remember , as I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-20.5036
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not correct .	-3.3069
I could not take them " , said Ferrell later .	-2.5774
" What happened today is a peak of what happened in the past .	-1.9242
It needs to know and see it and to be brought to .	-3.8968
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-3.2329
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is not different from the next black child .	-3.7360
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep them far from it ' .	-12.2016
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a campsite when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.3036
Ferrell and her daughter linked to a local business holder who made lunch .	-2.9476
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.8933
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to accept shape .	-2.4218
" My activism changed totally after August 9 , " she said and noted that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St . Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.3318
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.7724
Everything happened ' .	-2.3541
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.1706
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar only wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.0843
One question came about Ferrell : ' Does you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-4.1510
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often by white , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.4237
As Folayan recently stated in an interview : ' We had heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not centre their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-16.5113
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist in the field known for his activism around death insasses .	-3.9695
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-3.2232
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us . " We talk " , said Davis .	-2.5390
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are represented , because that is how I will be presented . "	-4.5548
The goal was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together " , Folayan said - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-3.9579
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life , as she loves and marries her wife .	-2.9636
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.5728
'But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humiliation of black people ' .	-3.3685
Furthermore , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black live matter movement .	-2.5096
Two of the three founders of the movement that , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , shaped the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.0836
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have worn the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-3.5231
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything ' .	-2.3669
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement is really kept upright by black women and many black women " .	-2.7230
However , it insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity .	-3.4740
" She was the person who framed this energy , " she said .	-3.1567
" It is not a coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because a life at these crossings is at stake as a black , gay woman .	-16.4067
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.2005
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but racian links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-3.0505
Ferrell is on proof for 2 <unk> years for blocking a motorway with a demonstration .	-3.3116
It describes the social atmosphere of the area , which she calls her home : " A chaos " . not only , but a , but and a not only , but , , , and , , , , ,	-14.8676
However , she is gathering to a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Fergusoa few years she toin her . shshe a short and shshshe a shor	-17.0758
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.7364

From " dream " to " size waw " : TV readers discuss bit gallery	-3.7010
The bit gallery moves people , even though it is not built for a long time .	-2.6122
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone since the first presentation of 2009 split the population in supporters and opponents .	-3.1449
Cold does not leave the topic any .	-2.7885
On our Facebook page " Volksfriend Bitburg " the topic is also being discussed .	-19.7436
While the one said about the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be truly class " ( Nicole Schaussen ) , comes from the other side : " Do not need a human being " ( Siggi Betzen ) or simply : " Great Craze ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-5.7870
While the advocates are building that a gallery moves more clients into the city , which also benefits the other shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed .	-5.2657
Additionally , the gallery is planned on the premises where the farm market hall , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-16.4939
This will stop at the start of the construction work .	-3.0848
The Gallery Machers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with possibility to the outside seats .	-4.7449
Simone Rooms : " We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years .	-3.2679
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers are always very happy to come back again to lifethe day . a lot of to see .	-23.9531
We also discovered the butchery for us .	-1.7172
We would like to see a chance of maintaining this offer during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-3.5445
In other cities it is also possible .	-2.9497
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting . '	-2.2274
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery , comes to the amount of rent .	-3.8947
However , the new project should not be low . '	-3.4860
Eva Kilic : " Why Bitburg shopping palaces ?	-2.8446
Whether clothing , shoes , drug or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-2.6652
There are enough of them in our city .	-3.0954
One can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.2608
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we maintain the market hall at least .	-3.9667
After all , the goods offered there are fresh fresh , mostly offered directly from the producer and is top price .	-5.0906
As you can see , shops are rented in a shopping center only by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not acceptable to a retailer .	-4.9063
It is a pity that special business almost no longer exists and what remains will disappear . '	-3.9146
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together .	-1.8690
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.6874
Above all , where is the farming market hall going to be during construction ?	-3.7956
The old edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives at some point .	-16.6008
Or will the specter of bit gallery be able to drive all shops from Bitburg beforehand in ?	-15.7011
George Marquet : " That simply will not work .	-1.6607
And a shopping centre that is empty does not need anyone .	-2.2795
I believe that it would have been better to promote a proper farming market rather than this gallery .	-3.1417
But for a farming market hall , thanks to the miraculous many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg are no longer a place .	-4.7341
When the farming market hall is broken down , a piece of culture will disappear again . '	-3.4868
A suitable similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-2.1880
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cable .	-3.8782
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey Hagborg of Wangen poppers and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.1516
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst had a 35-year-old imprisonment after she made public as a secret classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.6916
The new exhibition opened on August 2 means A Becoming Resemblance ( an appropriate similarity ) .	-2.5584
It is the product of two years correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united its technical expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and manning , a transfrau and groundbreaking dissident , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted only three days ago in his office .	-4.4458
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA , which was extracted by manning and created from 30 portraits , as someone might look like with these genomic data , has a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual , comment not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.8691
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but since her puberty has spoken openly about identification as woman , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six infringements against the Spionage Act , Computer Fraud and Thief .	-4.0342
Through the prison , her image was oppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a grainy , black and white selfie where manning apparently sits unlikely on a driver 's seat and wears a plating-blond bead - with which she was associated .	-6.8032
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 ' Stranger Visions ' project .	-2.5563
In this , the artist produced portraits of foreign artifacts such as cigarette stumble and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people might look like .	-4.1026
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.0205
" They led an interview with Chelsea Manning , while they were in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.3347
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so he took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.2655
The artist and her imprisoned muses became unequal letters who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-3.6330
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " that was illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , predicting a future in which President Chelsea ’ s ruling would be converted and able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.2959
Indeed , that Obama would demand mannings release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.7712
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against government camps and against transgender troops to find new , wealthy ways to flame further the rigid divisions that he should really remedy .	-6.6576
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that ' things happen for a certain reason ' .	-20.6899
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for an overwhelming signature among them ( the " i " in their family name is with a heart ) an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which has been gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-5.2738
On the opposite wall , its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand fillers of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-4.0006
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-24.3910
" What people will hopefully take of it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-3.7346
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . "	-1.9635
The last piece in the exhibition that is stored in its own room is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-3.6486
She shows manning how she appears in the hands of a disciplinary caserns of the United States such as King Kong .	-4.1715
" If you cold-plate your speech , then they won , " it is said .	-17.8048
" So never stops the mouth " .	-1.9185
" It came directly from a letter she wrote " , said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia .	-2.1958
'I still get gase-skin when I talk about it ' .	-3.5775
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as foreseen in the comicbook - but if it should be done , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by its own genomic simulators , who like hordes of protesters combine .	-5.6246

Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford for killing	-2.9092
A nationwide human hunt is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford who was seeked as suspects after a man was stolen in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .	-4.9331
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murders due to their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as showed by the acts of the Cook County Official Court .	-12.4687
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , after several sticks died .	-1.6062
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-1.8347
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-3.2579
Cornell-Duranleau was still explained at the place of events dead , and detectives examine the pieces as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , civil servants said .	-4.4188
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor for microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-17.4958
Alan K. Cubbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem was now in vacation and had been excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus .	-3.9566
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.0704
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-1.2651
A spokesman of the University and Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that ' we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and willing to help the US investigation authorities in every way ' .	-3.6177
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked , and he wanted himself to be .	-3.3105
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urged the suspects to face up to the authorities .	-2.4303
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them reinforce themselves , " Guglielmi said .	-14.2674
Guglilmi said that local , regional and national authorities help find the suspects .	-2.0414
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip , which said that something was happening in apartment 1008 .	-4.0048
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.0009
Guglilmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.6024
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-1.6928
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .	-1.9920
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : " The police are currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-11.8362
" We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future " - the Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko	-2.3994
The Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of Russia ’ s anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) to be in place in Rusthe remainof the to do so . the Russiin the the in the of of the of the and the of the of the of the	-17.4351
" At a certain stage of fulfilling the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-2.9233
The WADA Road Plan was updated in this regard , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.6437
The PM commented the second part of the WADA road map to comply with the code describing the criteria for the reinstatement of RUSADA and was recently published on the organization 's website .	-3.7434
According to Mutko , he contains nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia .	-2.2510
" Everything has been announced , everything is being implemented .	-1.7130
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future " , he added .	-2.2546
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to allegedly supported doping in Russia 's sport .	-20.3859
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : " We carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has acknowledged a error in this .	-5.2774
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.3012
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-2.7033
Mutko ’ s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission .	-13.5100
In conversation with Russia ’ s RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov gave rise to problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.4117
Nobody intended to unconditionally accept this report , " added Smirnov .	-2.3165
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the wake of the doping scandal of the WADA .	-3.5224
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK anti-doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.0546
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director Olivier Niggli stated that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be re-established .	-3.7895

Start ups that will help your company not become the next Uber .	-2.1830
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your employees at your e-commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-3.2084
Answers were often vague , little helpful or , worse , fraudulent .	-2.0388
Even if you promised anonymity , some workers do not dare the process .	-2.0384
" There was never consistency and objectivity " , said Errett , who operates the 75 person San Francisco e-commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-2.6606
She has called people from outside for help .	-11.8649
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help businesses find out how their employees feel .	-16.4678
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it allows companies to carry out polls , address special groups and demographic groups , offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases whistleblowers , circumvent C-Suite executives and directly contact the administrative board .	-4.5751
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .	-3.2109
Herrett said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel won with glint in the three years .	-3.1424
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company , which shows at a glance what units have most complaints and which executives have low consent results - so that you can redress why .	-4.8471
Companies come to realise that the leadership of job culture must remain to ensure that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment that punished those who have spoken .	-4.9301
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business option .	-2.5860
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments financial website .	-2.8380
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps businesses to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in miscredit .	-3.3174
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.3298
Uber recently signed up as a client .	-1.6596
Like Glint , Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-3.2805
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.9405
And if the principal manager is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.2450
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and manager of Convercent .	-2.6065
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , Quinlan said costly consequences through consumer boycott , employee fluctuation and complaints .	-4.3326
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their corporate centres .	-3.6435
Previously , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate centres , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.4609
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to track complaints from employees .	-3.2128
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems hidden previously by leaders who were in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair internship - can be identified and addressed faster .	-3.9333
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view into the experience of employment , " said Vitrano , who leads Ruby Tuesday ’ s risk management group .	-15.7497
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-1.7021
Companies began to take ethics , values and employees more seriously in 2002 , after Arthur Andersen collapsed the Enron scandal for ethical infringements , Quinlan said .	-3.8767
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies recognized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry online .	-3.4207
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4575
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurrent charges for using their products .	-2.5989
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups .	-2.4537
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-2.9146
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners , bringing total funding to $ 60 million .	-2.8073
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture , and venture capital .	-2.2471
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-3.0103
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only operational .	-15.2986
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.0623
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.5970
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well , companies run well when employees are employed and committed .	-3.5089
If analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and employment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.3141
Data on employee engagement according to experts in the workplace culture are important .	-3.4975
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-2.8419
Indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may be expected to change the way .	-2.9949
And if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and demotive employees .	-16.5479
" If you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 discussions " , said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , the companies that have relied too much on data collection .	-4.3116
" Because if you do not follow , employees will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.5572
Do you care about this ?	-2.4075
Who do you not care about why should I ? '	-3.3226
Madison Reed , who now carries out monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint , Errett .	-3.7474
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , capable of reorganizing several teams within the company and adding a communication training to address the problems .	-4.0394
With Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into employees , and it hopes that in the long term , this will lead to a better link between workers in an industry known for high revenues .	-5.3287
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.8454
" And if you lose people , you lose customers too .	-1.9004
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-1.7486
NCAA eliminates the two day practices and makes a long day for Bruin	-16.8331
It is up to 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA football players maintain on a page of the team ’ s new exercise fields on plto .	-7.8171
Some have pulled out their trico parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of training camp .	-3.9322
For a good part of the team , these minutes are a lunch break .	-2.7455
Players entered into summer courses will return to their final tests after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Water Football Center next morning .	-4.3713
" This is a real treat mill for the boys next three days , " said Bruin-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Tuesday became a Tuesday .	-4.4677
NCAA eliminates two day exercises to facilitate the burden of the players and has actually extended their days - at least until the Friday final .	-3.3871
Therefore , the first three trainings of UCLA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the players ' already packed timetables .	-4.2030
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season , and for the first time during the summer school , Mora ’ s six playing hours in Westwood carried out practical exercises durinin in Westwood in the summein Morand in Morin .	-14.3326
They are to hold 18 exercises during August 20 prior to the beginning of the formal preparations for their beginnings against Texas A & M in September .	-4.6070
Mora said that he supported the regulation of NCAA , even if they add another point to the multi-employed routes of the players .	-4.4014
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.3759
" And they simply pushed it through , they keep placing themselves , they are great people .	-3.7850
I think that once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-18.6068
UCLA will end its practices once the camp is completed , which will not be easy , given the clear views of its fields from an adjoining parking space and the adjacent Luskin Center , a high-class hotel already designed with footballs , which clean a protective network behind a camp .	-7.9151
Bruin players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there might be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-3.0423
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.6517
" This is a real problem , and it is not far from being seen to think that people rent a room there and then prepare themselves to record an exercise .	-21.5488
If you have the video bound of an exercise , it is a fairly good deal .	-3.7063
But we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.4435
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.7557
I therefore do not worry too much .	-2.3465
We have a plan ' .	-0.7941
Facebook wants to intensify fact-checking in the fight against counterfeit messages	-2.7385
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party fact reviewers and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-4.2007
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false messages and to send them to fact reviewers that may display results of the fact checking from the original article .	-4.3760
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake-News , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 . not only but the the Facthe Faceand Sociof the United in the the United of Amof Amand and the United of Amof Amof the United .	-25.1283
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to penalise social media networks if they fail to address hateful postings as before the September elections .	-4.3842
On Thursday , Facebook , in a separate declaration in German , said that in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany , a test of the new fact check will be launched .	-3.3786
" Besides the recognition of the stories contested by third-party fact reviewers , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for facebook messages in a blog .	-3.4521
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the " related article " and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong news .	-3.6538
Creating a Comic Roman Castle in England ’ s history	-1.8142
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-2.9006
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rhodes , a mophaary Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.9750
" I find it so beautiful to look at the handscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years " he says homogeneous .	-16.1454
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-1.8290
" A Castle in England " spans the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-4.4277
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotionally .	-2.5035
" I reacted only to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter so written by a double agent in the 1700s working for the Jacobins " he says .	-3.5216
" That is his thumbnail pri!	-11.9836
And letters always appeared to smoke , because at that time they did ignite a fire because of the light .	-4.3302
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were there himself .	-3.2736
Oh , I love Archives ! '	-1.1402
For someone who was beaten with old papers in such a way that he was supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived almost four months in a castle ( " To be honest : I have overvalued my welcome a bit " ) , this seems all too beautiful to be true .	-5.1091
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , seeing the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hygiene heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .	-4.3925
He walked through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes also with artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-3.7597
Then , night he trank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-2.5702
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access until 2006 , when the last heritage , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-13.4888
When Rhodes entered a decade later , employees began to take care of the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , discarded it on the attic " .	-3.8573
Divers , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent what was said : " One might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-4.2791
Ladies and gentlemen , let everything go in their way ! , "	-11.4296
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labour ' , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm revolt of 1381 .	-4.4755
" There is a record of a turmoil in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.3706
" The farming uprising began in this area and I thought that a revolt was a good start .	-2.9501
Perhaps the two are interconnected ? "	-2.2163
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuit patriot that the Darrell family hided for seven years during the English reform .	-4.1701
Or ' The Smuggler ' , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell was displayed from the 18th century , who staged his own hardship by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-5.8478
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be pretty gauners to be , continue to debt , and spend money on things they could not afford .	-4.6026
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marriing rich old women - I present them as a bunch of good guys , with a talent to promote heritage . "	-27.1860
After the end of his work in the castle , Rhodes is searching for other unique writing experience . to the and the to . the the of the of of	-14.9635
He brought behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness to a comic novel above Elämäki , the terrain of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature .	-4.8465
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.2293
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.3851
It was like ' Oh , now I have to deal with the condemned life ' .	-2.9815

Military reform in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.5648
Every year in early August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) discusses pension and transportation in officer corps .	-3.6561
This is also the case this week .	-1.9958
At first glance , a normal process .	-1.5874
But nothing is routine to Turkey ’ s armed forces one year after the coup .	-2.0110
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the general staff , as previously , but in the Prime Minister ’ s office .	-3.9939
The Head of Government has now also participated in the discussions and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .	-3.6737
Thus , the civilians in the YAS were overwhelming .	-3.6364
The government attracts reins in the military .	-1.2789
Hulusi Akar , General Head of Staff , remains in office , but the army commanders , airforces and marine forces were deported .	-5.0136
Since the failed coup , Erdogan ’ s leader has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirales .	-18.5134
More than 10,000 troops were removed from the army 's ranks - mostly because of supposed connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , Erdogan sees as the coup test wire .	-4.7231
486 people who have been directly involved in coup trying have been negotiated in Ankara since this week .	-3.8001
On the day after the coup Erdogan described the overthrow attempt as a " gift of God " as he gives him the opportunity to purify the armed forces completely .	-5.2200
But has Erdogan really undermined the army ?	-1.8650
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article heading " Uneasy in the Military Headquarter " .	-18.2021
In the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing " Islamization " of the army , which , among other things , manifest themselves in lifting the ban on headscarves for soldiers , the newspaper wrote not until the newin ques, but also in the .	-19.2319
In any case , great purification of the army and the security forces continues .	-3.5036
In mid-July , Erdogan came to fire another 7395 state servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.7998
Erdogan seemed to have counted the military .	-2.4985
The generals used to be the real masters of the country .	-2.6446
Three times , they called on their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-3.4609
After his 2002 electoral victory , Erdogan pressed for the military ’ s power step back step by step , not least on the European Union ’ s reform targets .	-18.4309
Former officers say that Erdogan is targeting an Islamization of the Armed Forces .	-3.3291
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a not-named officer who was looking for asylum to coup for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army will be in a few years ' full of extremists and salafists ' .	-4.7101

Washington Changes the Green Card Rules	-1.5763
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Trump said , cited by the media .	-1.8959
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-3.5803
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.6367
The draft legislation is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.0725
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , and save billions of dollars to taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way the US spends Green Cards from other countries . "	-2.9237
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.1890
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-2.9706

In order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , construction will begin this year , according to the Department of Transport .	-4.3434
" With the decision to continue ordering and refurbishing the route Ilmenau Racing , the country is committed to this major link , " explained Secretary of State Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-27.5674
The cost of replacing the route was around EUR 2.5 million .	-2.3898
Of this sum , the country accepts 75 % .	-1.7546
The Treaty , on which the shuttle should be ordered in future by the country , will finally be voted on , explained shuttle .	-4.7689
The Ministry and the South Thuringia rail as operator have already agreed on the technical details .	-3.7349
" This means that the roadmap , the used vehicles and the quality standards are negotiated " , said soul .	-4.3522
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years .	-2.1780
The racing shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-2.9212
The racing shuttle is a popular railway link between Ilmenau and racing stations .	-3.7954
In recent months , pilot operations have been tested as a result of whether the route is used by sufficiently many people to regularly order it in the future .	-4.1784
The route is also heavily constructive in parts .	-2.7816
The rise in sex robots is real , and we should be concerned about it .	-15.1046
It was precisely when you thought that 2017 cannot be even more crazy that a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots will come .	-4.8722
Yes , in fact .	-0.8338
Sex robots are currently a great thing .	-2.0352
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-1.7805
According to Noel Sharkey , emerged professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founders of the FRR , we must start taking their rise seriously .	-2.7793
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast wart and the type of fingernail .	-3.0079
" People are making fun about them , but companies provide a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , " Mr Sharkey said when publishing his new report .	-5.3259
Modern sexuals have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.1767
The user can also " adapt " his robot according to his convictions , while choosing everything from the robot ’ s eye color to the shape of breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.4166
But it will be even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that a Stepford woman would be progressive .	-3.3567
Modern sexups have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.2724
The RealBotix robot allows users , for example , to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as boldness .	-4.0146
And then there is the Roxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of boldness and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-3.7944
" Roxxy Gold has a personality that is customized to your personality as well as possible " , swarms the website of True Companion .	-3.5354
So they like what you like , and they do not like what you do not like , etc .	-1.8488
She also has her moods during the day - just like real people !	-3.2412
It can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be " in mood " ! "	-1.9488
There are many worrying aspects of this rise in sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the subjected female characteristics , the allusions to rape when one step towards Frigid ( i.e. here : reluctant ) Farrah worry one most .	-5.3846
On its website compared True Companion Roxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.0058
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxy ? " it says on the site .	-3.2288
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish , or just another sex toy .	-3.5421
Their origin and growing refinements point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality , to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-14.4353
Most men will obviously not hold sex robots , and while the FRR notes their rising popularity , they remain temporarily on the brink of consumer culture .	-3.8017
But what transcends from the peripheral zones can be very lessons in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.1620
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission .	-2.0109
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots emerge at a time when women 's rights are threatened worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who has boasted sexually attacking women .	-4.3017
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of Magd ' ) is not the graphical images , the swallowed body and the eyes , but how realistically this vision works .	-3.8164
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment this does not feel like a great leap .	-2.4496
The aim behind these sex robots is to create a physical similarity to actual women as realistically as possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-2.6943
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they emulate the movement of a real body .	-2.3025
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , robots are not real women .	-2.8366
They cannot separate themselves from their companion or simply go away .	-2.9586
They have no mediation or background history , nothing indicating independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-3.6362
In other words , they are complacent slaves .	-1.8110
Or to put it in the 2017 speech : Girls of service	-2.1060
Trump ’ s great performance ?	-1.4570
He makes Mitt Romney the concept of common sense .	-2.3307
It has become a Trump era ’ s knowledge that the political divisions that the US voters have polarized have also divided families in small format .	-4.4466
There were newspapers in the US around Christmas and Harvest with advice on how to deal with the Horror of Trump .	-3.6498
We are all supposed to be strict to put our filter bubbles on the .	-17.1171
Less commented has been Trump ’ s power to bring together families .	-1.9711
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-2.9812
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-2.0308
With Trump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republican family with whom she had fought for decades because of politics , is suddenly unique on the same side .	-3.9785
It is certainly a good thing for the dining table , but it falls to me in another context that this will also bring considerable risks .	-6.0112
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the dismantling effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.2639
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the cruel possibility that , one day , his girls will no longer refuse us .	-4.3921
But there is an even more appalling long-term scenario in which Trump ’ s right-wing Republicans “ normalize , ” suddenly appear as the embodiment of reasonability when compared to its standards .	-5.1588
Today , I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urkomic version of crazy - the dog on the roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked ) - both indeed occur as a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-5.3170
If Trump goes , the Republicans ’ next candidate must be mental only to qualify as immeasurable improvement .	-2.7704
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the Central Park , the largest of New York ’ s carousel park , and the best three dollars that can be spent in the city when no caffeine is needed .	-4.8276
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are short and the animals turn away to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and climbing music gives this in a strange way .	-4.9233
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not lived up to the dream .	-4.4123
Thirty years later , and I am still not entirely over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not included - but a great roundabout in the north of London .	-4.3164
However , the Central Park Carousell is still a strange magical experience , since two two-year-olds , a 11-year-old and two women can go to it in the 40s and all have a great time .	-5.0767
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but , fortunately , nobody has asked for it .	-3.2150
On the other hand , this week I was forced to assess my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could go through my credit card .	-3.2531
In the coffee house on the corner of my road , it is the same , plus the option of comparing the evaluation with a 15 % tip money - to buy something across the shop table .	-4.7399
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where no need is needed .	-3.8256
The poor woman in the department stood apologically grinding , while I muddled the experience to reach her credit card with five stars .	-4.4399
Oscar Pistorius with Pains of Breast to Hospital	-4.0472
For the second time , Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit .	-2.0550
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts on his handles , which he suffered the prison authorities according to one cell .	-4.4101
Pistorius was condemned against the first sentence of death for murders after an appeal by prosecutors .	-3.3929
He killed steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine Day 2013 by shoting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.8240
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night invader hiding in the cabin .	-3.6876
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year Pistorius Penalty Penalty , which they say is too indulgent .	-4.1384
The national law enforcement authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.3556
Pistorius runs the risk of increasing its penalty to 15 years when prosecutors are successful .	-2.8060
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7717
As a Bauer Arnold , there is a strange egg	-2.9171
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the fourth classes were released from rubbers and holidays in the holidays and in the extensive schools .	-6.2039
Three of the dismissal students will go to the gymnasium , four on the real school in the fuin the fu.	-4.9808
School manager Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public in the Biesential House in Epfenhofen on Tuesday .	-3.7760
As a symbol for the school release , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle growing up in the Hünerhof , but then released into freedom .	-4.4565
The muntere Shar led a musical title " The Adler in the Hühnerhof " .	-3.9982
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it break it from his chickens .	-2.3277
Instead of a chicken cows , a small eagle came out .	-2.8282
But the hope of making a chicken from him was disappearing , the eagle spread out and disappeared on a high mountain .	-4.0062
Then the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-2.5380
The hens danced with the young gockels who wear cylinders to bet .	-2.8421
The eagle stood for integration , said Schuller Angelika Sitte .	-2.3206
The virgin is different from the other kitchen ( kitchen ) , but belongs to it .	-4.7583
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.0380
Its provision is to be free .	-1.5707
She wanted every four-class that he feels accepted in his new school .	-16.1714
Thanks to the Members , the former school leader Michael Müller , who keeps teaching shortages and parents ' representatives .	-5.1811
The cold season is over , class teacher Sophia Schumacher explained .	-2.8711
She released her students after two years of lessons very unfortunately , because it was a really great time .	-4.8885
After all , they have relied on the fourth classes .	-3.1335
To conclude , all students made a song of summer time and holiday time .	-4.6546
The children were very happy about this .	-3.1877
For the new year , eight first-class classes are already registered .	-3.5811
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-0.9660
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , cited by television .	-2.6222
On the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegally campaigning people in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.5412
They were released on the same day , while an inquiry is currently under way .	-2.8745
The foreign ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-1.4921
The Greek authorities have tightened control of the free camp and put significant fines to everyone who is found in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-3.6955
Controls continue throughout the season .	-1.9205
The ministry said that the court can impose fines .	-2.2236
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the people concerned now need to know .	-3.0362
How exactly will the software update take place ?	-1.4454
Does diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?	-16.7525
Overview of the most important questions and answers .	-1.9408
At the Diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for about 5.3 million cars .	-2.9869
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emissions classes .	-3.7666
Euro 4 diesels or worse are excluded .	-1.8623
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :	-2.4864
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.8438
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-0.9570
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have control software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.1617
The Federal Railway Agency ( KBA ) has arranged its retrofitting .	-22.3460
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-1.5610
Manufacturers have announced swift implementation over the next few months , but have not yet mentioned an exact date .	-3.6570
Daimler has communicated to write to every person concerned .	-3.2227
If , in any case , an inspection is due , it will be done within its framework .	-2.8350
How long will the restructuring move ?	-3.6662
" To say hard , " says Smetanin .	-2.4603
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and political pressure .	-2.3222
'Because we have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environment has not yet been taking . ' so . , , , , , , , ,	-12.0530
How long will the update take ?	-1.5314
The upgrade could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.9431

LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award	-1.2503
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington .	-1.5046
President Trump ’ s first award promises to be politically spe.	-12.4169
One of the winners doesn 't want to come out of protest .	-16.6387
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive the renowned Kennedy Center awards .	-22.1400
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and the Choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the prisoners .	-3.7017
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .	-1.5733
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will be hosting a reception and , along with his wife Melania , attend in the a.	-22.3829
The Prize winner Lear , known with progressive TV series , has therefore already announced that he will not participate in the gala .	-5.0693
The " New York Times " he said : " This presidency has decided to completely neglect arts and human rights - even withdraw the funds from them - and this burdens me . "	-5.1032
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the talk with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.3763
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.5111
Previous winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-1.9055
We are making the city life worth living	-3.5333
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s town master , will be in pension next year .	-3.1118
The place is already prescribed - suitable applicants are rare .	-3.9428
For 31 years , Wacker has been a town master .	-2.4609
And the work still enjoys him great fun in the press conversation .	-4.4404
He reports varied and demanding tasks that wait for his successor .	-3.1325
At the same time , it is wondering that no application has yet been able to meet the requirement profile .	-4.7320
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next possible date .	-22.1316
So , in accordance with the regular termination deadlines , there is still plenty of time to work .	-5.3372
Since Haslach is the sub-construction rights authority for the administrative community , the candidate must provide accounts .	-4.8439
This function certainly wants to keep the city .	-2.7190
If they could no longer fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-3.5516
But closer to the city and to him himself , Wacker says , who reports of a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and the citizens .	-5.2236
More than 30 years in office have accumulated some important projects , which are proud of the wackers .	-4.3417
" We make the town lively " , he is safe with the construction office and its employees .	-4.5292
In the future , however , varied projects are also on the agenda : the reshaping of the former Hukla area and the low-court parking space , for example , has been initiated .	-6.0725
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .	-3.3692
The latter alone will book at around EUR 1.5 million , " if we do the right thing , wacker appreciates .	-4.4427
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.5256
The work here is fun . '	-1.0275
Great room for a town master is designed .	-4.7687
With Haslach ’ s own construction house and gardenery , many can be reacted quite flexibly .	-4.6681
" You can move a lot " , wacker , and the shape of green facilities is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-4.2823
Since the old town as an ensemble is under protection of monuments , it is important to " have an eye to what matches " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city tree master emphasises . the the the the of the of the the of the the of the of the of the the of of the of and the the of of	-27.0135
In any case , the city tree master has a high responsibility .	-3.8758
He is a building owner , " at the end everything goes on my table " .	-4.3108
Markus Neumaier ( high construction ) has been in the process for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( deep building ) for 15 years .	-4.2309
Even that his successor remains long , Wacker wants to see , " We are looking for someone who really identifies and wants to stay with the place .	-5.1095
For continuity is important not only for a good operating climate , but also for further design of the city .	-3.0006
If you wish to inherit Roland Wacker , you should study a completed study as a diploma engineer or a bachelor with specialist architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction law .	-5.6515
The city building office has high and low construction , construction planning , basic business matters , administration of urban properties , urban business house with building house and city garden , as well as under construction rights authority , including monuments protection .	-7.0039
Bicycle on directions : Locked South Railway	-4.1024
According to the police , the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the train transfer in the Leobener Street ( B116 ) .	-4.1330
These were so heavily damaged that the accompanying train had to be encouraged .	-3.8513
The investigators are based on two male perpetrators and have been looking for them for them since the night . a not , but a not .	-15.5430
A rose-red scooter and a bicycle rider were observed near the fact that witnesses had been observed .	-4.4948
" This goes far beyond a couple of bungalows , " said ÖBBB-Speaker Christoph Posch to the APA .	-4.5782
The perpetrators or the perpetrators would have dangered themselves and threatened train .	-4.1747
In addition to the damage to the location and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of replacement for rail transport , the rail customers could also pay to the perpetrators .	-6.5760
In total , the speaker said that it was " substantial " sum .	-4.3759
The damage was resolved on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern track could be carried out without disabilities .	-4.7042
Nearly ten passenger trains had fallen Friday morning , two of them concerned distance traffic .	-3.5530
Goods failed , but they were delayed .	-3.5245
According to ÖBBB-Speaker Christoph Posch , around 200 metres of overpipelines had to be exchanged .	-3.9805
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.6817
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate may help relieve IBD ( inflammatory noise )	-1.9281
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestion system .	-1.2410
But a new study claims precisely the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory noise diseases .	-2.3917
The incurable state in the US affecting around 1.3 million and 300,000 in Britain causes stomach and bloodstream , recurring or bloody diarrhea , loss of weight and extreme fatigue .	-4.7528
While those affected usually failed to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant noise .	-4.6443
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , stated that immune cells patrol in the inside to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in eating do not enter the body .	-4.1745
Cells capable of causing inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissue .	-2.8555
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory loan disease .	-3.1035
In experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance promoting immunization occurs in mice that bear a particular bacterium in their influences .	-5.6447
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-2.4569
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbium and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-3.2107
The more tryptophane had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells " .	-13.2983
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a Tryptophan rich nutrition promote tolerant , less inflammatory inflammatory darmmy if the same system also works with people .	-4.9249
The postdoctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes barragan examined a kind of immunization that promoted tolerance when she found that a group of study machines had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not have it . .	-17.1058
She suspected that the difference with the darmmic robiomes had to do with the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms that usually live in the stomach darm tract .	-4.9526
The nozzles of the mice were sequenced and six bacterial species were found that were available in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missithe mi. the the the the of and the the the of . the the the the	-18.8197
Mauses were refurbished in a sterile environment , so that they lacked a darmmicrobiom and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-5.6589
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri were growing in liquid and then transferred small quantities of fluid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated by the mice .	-4.1111
Immuncells developed into tolerance cells .	-2.4687
When the active component was cleaned out of fluid , it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid .	-2.8064
If researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the tryptophane values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-14.6388
Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same cells that promote tolerance as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our stomach intelligence tracts .	-4.1481
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in people as they are in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found among people with inflammatory noise .	-4.8476
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we would like to promote , since these cells control inflammations on the internal surface of the inside of .	-4.3207
Potentially high tryptophane values in the present of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population ' .	-3.5782
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic committed a " genius " to Nemanja Matic .	-2.5938
At Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-2.7426
The 40 million pounds signed by Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid on Tuesday begins , and impressed in the holder role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira moved to popular .	-5.0236
However , Matic was excluded from the blues ’ preparatory Asia tour and created only 45 minutes , adding Mourinho that he had to improve before the Premier League season bebegan in the . the of the in 1995 , the the the the of the Bluof Mthe in 199of of the of the British .	-27.7483
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-2.2085
'We will help him sooner than later ' .	-1.9979
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started Aviva Stadium when Mourinho formed his Start XI for the beginning of the season .	-3.4200
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three further new obligations , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfil three of its four priority new commitments .	-19.7529
" Three of four , for which I thank the association , " he added .	-2.3328
" I will be happier if they receive four of four , but they have made a great effort " .	-3.6965
Boeing " Dreamliner in Sky	-1.9296
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in heaven .	-2.2106
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US state of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which are several thousand kilometres .	-3.8866
The action took 18 hours and one minute .	-1.7449
A dreamliner was shaped on the radar screens .	-3.0833
The whole was a stamina test for new engines .	-2.4751
Boeing had already made such advertising .	-1.6779

Since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundamentally .	-2.1892
Since then , employees from the Willy Brandt House have been watching the events in SPD ruled capitals with growing horror .	-4.7269

The Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Greens following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony .	-3.1151

Transferring to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will to vote .	-17.5060

It is the provisional highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD associations .	-2.5306
And no one knows what comes next .	-11.2878
The misery began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-2.0969
A blue eye , no longer , the comforts at the time calmed down .	-3.3305
After the country ’ s elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-12.1006
That also became - and everything became much worse .	-3.5362
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the tamules that the Düsseldorf Pleite scattered the party smoothly .	-4.6719
The comforts then turned up again during the weeks .	-5.2762
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-2.5382

Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD country chief , lost his nimbus at that weekend because he was in Elbphilharmony while his city burned .	-3.4966

They allowed him to grant him because they promised to stabilise the in that .	-5.8190
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-1.7531

For children , refurbishments to date are a " success project " - finally , it is important to encourage internal development and not just to open up new construction areas .	-4.7805
On 4 April , the Karlsruhe Government preserved the information that there will be a refurbishment area III .	-3.7610
The total funding amount to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country , the rest of the community receiving receptions from it .	-17.7145
How does a recovery area arise ?	-3.6292
You will continue to study where the " really old " houses are .	-3.5623
However , it also plays a role in restoring interest in the planned area .	-4.0343
If necessary , the territorial borders could then shift again .	-2.6970
The STEG took place on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.1885
Keller presented the content of the Federal Country Program " Social City " , in which the refurbishments would be carried out .	-4.3330
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of domestic cities , improving housing and working relations and maintaining and developing infrastructure .	-4.0197
The measures would be implemented object-related , i.e. per property .	-3.7013
The restoration area would then finally be defined as a statute .	-14.5319
Since 1 January 2017 the approval period for the funding has been running until 30 April 2026 .	-3.5724
However , until September this year , the inventory would only be carried out once and for all , in which the parties involved in the restoration area have a questionnaire to fill in .	-7.0349
In November or December , the decision on the statutes will be taken , so that rehabilitation can begin next year .	-5.2306
Pietzsmann then explained that each community must carry out the previous investigations .	-3.5464
It is a question of evaluating the urban building abuses and deciding when will be renovated and to what extent .	-4.6818
A refurbishment note is also included in the Ground Paper for the respective land .	-5.8271
Pietzsmann will come back to reception and make a picture of the location , she promised .	-4.0491
Godzel emphasised that the project was the participation of the participants . in the project was a in and .	-20.9047
There will therefore be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and filled out until the end of the summer holidays .	-4.2458
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land arc " , which concerns , among other things , the construction and the restoration intentions .	-4.4418
In the grey questionnaire , the " budget and housing arc " , data can be made on size , division and residents of a housing area .	-3.7491
The blue " Operating Arc " is only to be filled out if the building operates business rooms .	-4.8147
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a full questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-3.9364
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .	-1.6735
Schindler still stressed that the distribution of funds worked according to the ' wind hundreds ' principle - who comes first waits for the first .	-21.8642
You cannot " reserve funds later " .	-3.1188

British inventors themselves have a microchip to get a hand movement in house and car and car .	-3.6358
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip so that he can open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.7419
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointing fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .	-3.5475
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire Council Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implantation process is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.8041
The technology is similar to a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.1197
Mr Northam also wants to change locks to houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-3.7744

The White House ’ s advertising costs thousands of taxpayers	-1.2584
The White House ’ s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to US $ 24,000 according to the military ’ s declarations left to the TIME magazine to be done . to the in the the in the of the of to the to the to the the the in of the of .	-19.1832
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-2.9168
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials took a round through products from all 50 countries .	-2.7732
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a fire car from Wisconsin and a fork stack from Mississippi .	-3.8944
The White House Military Office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , after the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-3.6030
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility " , the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event of his chairman , the Deputy Commander for Aviation .	-16.8472
The message showed that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn on 17 July at 7 p.m. , and so long until the grass was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-4.1954
The note adds that , if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second team would be needed for the return flight because of the restriction of service hours not . the the of in the of . the the of the of of the the of the of the .	-24.0349
The original crew was helicopter during the event , while the security personnel remained on the aircraft during the time .	-20.4098
The records provided by the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second crew was ultimately necessary .	-4.0225
Hatch Act prohibits state employees from using government property for political purposes .	-2.4352
Records indicate that HMX-1 has asked whether the event could infringe the provi.	-20.7003
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act , and we were informed that this was not the case " wrote the commander .	-19.2124
" Submitted as though you are closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-20.0705
The event " Made in America " was described as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.3982
But official events also have political upper tones .	-2.0153
At the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of health reform , which was under way in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to contain government regulations .	-23.6841
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically advantageous purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.3605
Presidents are obliged to use them for their journey .	-2.2088
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.6218
Trump carried out an investigation in February when the presidential aircraft , against the background of his first campaign rallye in Melbourne , Florida , was carrying out taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of presidential aircraft by his predecessor .	-4.7055
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers with American materials " , said the Vice-Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.4336
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to replace US president in the White House with precise centimeter rates .	-3.4515
When Trump was in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , HMX-1 in the White House had 58 landings .	-3.0318
The flight for the " Made in America " event was counted during the training needs of the crew for the month , a civil servant said .	-3.6775
Helicopter units flew 11 hours a day for non-presidential support missions .	-2.6707
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden on none of the other requirements presented at the event .	-2.5821
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.4458
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event .	-3.2303
According to hours of the US Defence Ministry for the financial year 2017 , the VH-3D refund rate is USD 24.380 per flight .	-3.2317
Records of the unit were recorded in the aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-4.1458
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below this rate .	-2.1092
" The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-2.7297
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual resources ' .	-3.0387
According to a 2015 RAND study , refund rates for DoD do not include staff costs , but include fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion costs .	-3.5682
At that time , the former White House press spokesperson , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter for the event .	-3.1029
" The idea is to present things made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-1.9574
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people , depend on it .	-2.6891
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.4094
It is of course appropriate to emphasise this . '	-9.8579
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event , but he put himself in the driver ’ s seat of a fire car .	-3.9589
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky , shooting with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-15.7452
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.0408

How to Damage OMV America	-2.0834
Really , Donald Trump did not work when Wednesday night he set his signature under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.5438
" In his haste to legislate , " Congress packaged a few " unconstitutional rules " , he estimated .	-4.2013
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance .	-3.6360
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-2.5309
Accordingly , investors of the domestic OMV have been worried since then , co-financing the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea election Nord Stream 2 with other European companies .	-5.2511
The threat scene is enormous .	-2.8207
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , such as the Oil Group ’ s official statement .	-3.4876
Indeed , Donald Trump would have to bring the sanctions to life by executive order .	-2.9165

Despite the second season of Narcos , which revealed Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.7133
The seasons three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest evils of the show .	-3.9415
With the third season , the DEA has drawn attention to the world ’ s richest organisation of drug trafficking : the Cali cartel .	-2.9472
Leaded by four powerful patents , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribes and violent actions .	-3.2487
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican connection , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is in New York .	-2.8535

Return : The city provides 46 kitchen aid	-14.0444
The town organizes the Kita lunch table itself .	-2.8801
With solid contacts for the children and an assignment to the team .	-3.0982
The clock is shot back in the city ’ s children ’ s days .	-4.0074
On September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes care of food supplies in the urban children ’ s daily facilities ( kitas ) back into own regime .	-6.0115
For Sonja Pomerance , Deputy Head of Youth Assistance , this is a good news : " We have all been very pleased " .	-4.2571
Cooking is continued outside the house : a caterer assumes this task and delivers fresh cooking cooled .	-4.3191
The town operates 46 children ’ s places in the Krefelder area , in 44 children receive a warm meal for lunch .	-4.5621
In the past kita year , 2800 children were on the tables , and needs are steadily growing .	-4.6288
" Meanwhile , not only are children looking for 45 hours in the kita to lunch " explains Pommerance .	-17.7726
" Offer also applies to 35-hour care when children stay until 14 p.m. "	-3.6240
From September 1 , 46 part-time forces have kitchen service : They warm the dishes supplemented , supplement them to salad , raw cost and fruit , portion the meal individually , spend food , clean up and clean the kitchen .	-16.8079
" The employees are assigned firmly to a kita , " says Pommerance .	-2.5743
The size - there are two group facilities as well as seven group facilities - decides on the amount of hours .	-3.5437
" The kitchen helpers are now fixed to the kita team " , says Pommerance satisfied .	-18.0677
" Thus , they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for kitalization " .	-3.7030
This is also about healthy diets and cooking lessons .	-2.7786
" The children shall help prepare food " .	-15.8621
The direct connection of kitchen power to the team makes sense here .	-2.5960
Also for the children .	-1.4820
" You have a known power in the kita , a person familiar to them , and not always changing people " .	-3.1552
This continuity is important for children .	-1.1743
The cleaning of kita rooms - until now also the task of the kitchen forces - will be carried out by special cleaning staff .	-4.2078
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance , the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in the cost comparison between ownership and foreign awarding for the city , is said from the press team .	-7.1997
And that is despite the fact that 46 part-time forces are recruited .	-3.8913
" But these hours don 't even fall so much in the weight of around 750 people in education " , says Sonja Pommerance .	-4.6194

Men try to exterminate 13 years of girl	-3.1591
Two young men aged 19 and 23 were attempted to deprive a girl of 13 on Thursday .	-3.5051
According to information from the police , men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stayed with friends on Kolpingstrasse at 14.55 p.m. , because they wanted to call with the mobile phone of the girl .	-4.9778

GMB anxiety about investment in the Glasgow McVite factory	-2.1420
A trade union wants to assure itself with managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production in Glasgow .	-3.7567
GMB Scotland said that the company was silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-2.8648
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse in addition to other products .	-4.0527

GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot win clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affecin our Members not . to do the same in the future .	-26.0748
Family generations have worked here and the workers have focused strongly on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-3.7509
Therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising living costs and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie .	-4.2135
A Pladis spokesman said : " The filial leader at Tollcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-4.4457
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were openly discussed .	-2.8367

Interview : ' Domspatzen report discharges Pope Bruder Georg Ratzinger '	-2.0611
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on cases of abuse relieves Pope Bruder Georg Ratzinger .	-2.6443
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.6664
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions .	-2.8717
Christian Weisnder , Speaker of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , explained after publication of the German Press Agency , he expected an apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerged Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.3928
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their mistaken assessment of the transactions .	-5.0087
The vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised that in reporting violence in the dompats ' double standards ' would be measured .	-4.6548
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is ' shameful and shameful acts ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; but it is striking to be the ' degree of media manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee .	-5.0960
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep this normal , " Scaraffia writes .	-3.6894
Also Principal Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said in the interview with the Bavarian broadcasting : " You are happy to go to the church and this is a found fresh fresh fresh " .	-5.6551
In addition , she pointed out that in her youth , " strikes were a quite normal pedagogical means " to be done with children like me , one thing . "	-6.3471
It would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , for the world has changed .	-15.2907
In connection with the reports on abuse cases , the Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-3.5161
Wrongly , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with ratzinger the memorial band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated in 12 languages ) .	-13.9118
" I must defend Georg Ratzinger " , says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he values the results of the final report .	-3.6746
What exactly does the 440-page report presented by the Ulrich Weber lawyer , who was appointed by the Bistum Regensburg ?	-4.2226
In total 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were used sexually between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domspats .	-3.7287
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 , states that in many cases , Domkapellmeister R. has been applied to forms of physical and mental violence .	-3.7791
Especially with high emotionality , punishment for pupils could be more vigorous .	-3.7567
Nevertheless , contrary to many other accusers , many victims estimate R ’ s general humanity and , therefore , in many cases , even positive memories combine with him , despite violence .	-5.6657
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger discharges it .	-3.9186
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence exercise of protective foals in the Regensburg Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.4831
Firstly , many students highlight his ' humanity ' .	-2.7689
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist who was often handy when a domspatz did not bring top performance .	-4.8131
How do you , as his biographer , value this final report ?	-2.5310
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is in the first place .	-4.7163
He is just eight sides dedicated to them , and it is clearly freed from any suspicion of the middle or co-science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.9498
The force excesses at the pre-school were also beyond its sphere of effectiveness .	-3.2146
One can at best accuse him of learning too late or not taking initial statements seriously enough .	-4.3422
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was felt by practically all those respondents as - so literally - " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-14.2708
For example , the vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understandable " , as an extremely good teacher who regularly supplied the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and always " was transferred from grapes of children " .	-5.4771
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality , which also led to anger .	-3.6765
The fact that he did not only collapse with chairs and raised the key bond on the ground , but also distributed early figs and too fragile guys to the hair or ears , he admitted , deeply regretted and apologized for it even years ago .	-8.1347
However , as regards his honour rescue , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , which was the 1960s and 1970 ’ s , for parents as in teachers .	-4.8351
Are you also aware of such breeding methods ?	-1.7864
Of course , I think everyone who was born before 1968 .	-2.2484
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-14.7406
What is actually at stake in this report , namely the appalling sexual abuse and force excesses on the pre-school , are , of course , bagatelles .	-5.2046
The question is whether it has to do with his well-known and role as a brother of Benedict XVI , that many media crashed on him .	-5.1550
The Bavarian Pope is still working hard for many who have never understood him .	-3.9522
The truth is , however , that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-2.2879
The media reported a great deal about the issue of abuse in the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-3.5983
Will Georg Ratzinger also put any involvement or co-science on sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.2861
Michael Hesemann : No clear .	-2.1538
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted to the Domkapellmeister .	-14.5791
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.7492
" I never dared to speak to my father or mother about it " , said a person representative for others , " I was all very embarrassing .	-16.6012
The real problem with educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims remain silent .	-2.7469
If they did not even entrust themselves to parents and sisters , then certainly not a choral leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a way .	-6.1726
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzingers 's role in terms of abuse cases ?	-15.3584
Michael Hesemann : A surveyed student put it : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had had had some timely insight and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-17.3555
I think it is also truly absurd to assume that he is calculated ... Looks more forcefully or clearer , or even more , than towards their parents , boarding leaders , trust teachers , etc .	-7.1700
That one talks with him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.4582
Thus , the report comes to the very clear outcome : ' The students and / or their environment entrusted him in the run-up to it could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation ' .	-5.5755
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore free from every co-operation .	-3.4662
He cannot be accused of not being prevented or displayed .	-2.8776
So there is no reason to link his good name to these violent crimes , as unfortunately , in some cases .	-4.2478
In the media there was much to read about " violence " at the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-3.7544
The former chapel chapel , Georg Ratzinger , is accused of being accused of the report on the way .	-3.8259
Does he have to live with this accusation ? a a a a a a a a a a a a	-13.7907
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything is mixed in the reporting and has been merged into a huge multitude of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere in the midst of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.1545
But that is precisely what the report is abusing .	-3.6825
The fact is that there is clean separation : between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the dompats , between sexual abuse and violence excesses , and , let us say , other accusations .	-4.8176
Moreover , the report discusses incidents since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of the domspats .	-3.7881
All the terrible test education , cases in which cases of sadistic teachers were harassed and painted on a regular basis and suffered appallingly , all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions have been prevailed .	-7.0129
But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with , for he got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium .	-4.3513
As the vast majority witnesses emphasize , this was the theme " Preschool " tabu .	-4.7933
It was only happy to escape it and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-3.0586
What was different on the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-3.1666
Michael Hesemann : There was already discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-2.9927
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims estimate the general humanity of R. R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories are combined with him ' , despite violence .	-4.9429
So , at best , the accusation of looking away is still at all . a not , however a a not a a a not .	-18.1895
But , despite all the efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the states at the pre-school .	-4.2376
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and from what happened at a school where he did not listen and was not responsible ( so witness ) nothing , and then again around 1993 .	-5.9300
Does Georg Ratzinger close the ears consistently before the conditions ?	-2.5054
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-13.2822
He indicates that ' in pre-school the cancellation sentence will continue to be practised ' .	-6.4520
He recommended urgent intervention , given the danger of negative press releases .	-2.4012
This was , of course , when legal clarity existed , when caning sentences were long prohibited in Bavaria too .	-3.9628
Before that , they took place in a legal grey zone , as everyone of us knows .	-3.3961
It was difficult to assess where the parties concerned were perhaps exaggerated or dramatized and where the permitted limit was actually exceeded .	-5.2801
However , one cannot say that he had always looked away .	-2.8138
That is simply not true .	-1.0617
Only in 1980 was the official abolition of schools in Bavaria .	-2.8774
Principal Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's educational standards to the time .	-3.4137
What do you see ?	-1.6819
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " case strick of anachronism " , that is , the danger of evaluating past today 's moral standards .	-3.8291
The Principality is already right here .	-3.5036
But of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times , nor to what was happening in the pre-school of resistance and violence in innocent souls of children , which goes far beyond the usual .	-16.4145
That is all very terrible and I am glad it is finally being reconstructed .	-3.5835
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.4913
His means of disciplining and punishing , in other words of ear figs and the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.5984
When physical punishment was banned , he also kept strictly attached to it .	-3.8742
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reflected in talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-3.2617
Can the topic of caning be addressed in this ? the of the in the of of the of of the and the of the of the of of .	-18.8300
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book concerns the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , where the dompats played only one side role .	-3.9211
Nevertheless , I do not conceal the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-3.9909
But this too must be said : without this perfectionism , without the demands of essential discipline , it would have been hardly possible to form an institution of world-class cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which twice went on tour in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.6285
With biscuits and bonbons alone , one does not even make out of restrained bones a major singer and before every success , whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-7.5116
What kind of people did you experience Georg Ratzinger at the talks on her book ?	-2.6821
Michael Hesemann : By working on the book and beyond , I really known Georg Ratzinger very well and repeatedly experienced Georg Ratzinger as wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deep and heartfelt people , who cannot imagine that he could suffer even a fly .	-6.2324
I receive regular contact with him , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-4.1886
So those who have not forgiven him to this day that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority .	-3.5578
Most domspats are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them close to the world of music .	-2.4612
And that he always was a good , father teacher - a strict father , certainly - but also a loving respect to which they still look up today and which they worship .	-5.2860
Please , once again , make it quite clear that everything you accuse him is educational methods which were on the agenda at the time .	-4.6242
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-2.1180
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat .	-2.5667
There is the evil intention behind it all too obvious .	-2.5421
The report that has just been published releases it .	-14.7223
Now it would be decency that a 93-year-old man who gained great merit and would finally be able to peace without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany nobody would the Rnot be able to to a a peto .	-19.9344
