Gutch : More security for pedestrians	-2.2122
They are not 100 meters from each other : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian ampel has been operated at the village park - in view of the older town hall ampels .	-5.7910
Two systems so close to each other : Does the intention or citizenship strike ?	-4.0903
This question was clearly answered by Gutach ’ s mayor yesterday .	-2.5152
" The town hall ampel was installed at that time because it safeguards school path " , explained corner yesterday .	-15.7140
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus guests and the mountain inhabitants .	-3.1035
Yesterday 's official facility is important for the crossroads Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-3.3871
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.5734
" At the high traffic and pedestrian level , another traffic light had to be secured " , said Eckert .	-4.8944
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Offenburg Council Office .	-2.6249
" According to current measurements , at B 33 , about 12 000 vehicles pass through the Gutch community every day , including ten percent of heavy goods traffic , " Arnold emphasises .	-5.1767
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is simply going on here , " says Arnold .	-4.1291
Overall , four traffic shows were carried out , but a roundabout was also considered , but because of the narrow street in the crossroads Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-5.9161
According to Arnold , the traffic lights were previously tested : " With an extra long wooden tribes for us , we have established whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbach path to the B 33 without knocking the traffic lights " .	-6.9718
About 15 000 euros of expensive traffic light itself is the most " modern thing that exists on the market " , explained Arnold .	-4.6394
The complex is equipped with coloured LEDs , which are so powerful that the lights are well recognized by drivers , for example , even at deep sunshine . the the is in a way . the the and the the the the the liin the the the the the the the the the the the the the	-31.4169
It is also economical : the older light equipment consumes about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-3.9634
There are three light equipment per direction .	-2.5071
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.6404
Press the pedestrian button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-2.5309
If the road is free , the green comes immediately for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-16.8454
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be finished for the pedestrian pedestrian .	-3.4394
" If a group or disabled people go above the road , the green phase is extended , so everyone comes safely across the road , " said Arnold .	-4.3966
Of course , the drivers must think here as a partner and observe the driver .	-4.0445
This was not the case yesterday : hardly the traffic lights were green for pedestrians , a upper class vehicle rolled - at bright red .	-4.7063
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the necessity of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-2.9956
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - language lessons , the slope to raw violence and dull sexuality , the close and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet .	-5.9131
The Büchner prize winner is especially known as prosauthor , theatre texts are rar in his work .	-3.9763
Collage from prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher combines a collage of prosatexts for his performance " Weather Lights on the Tungspitze " , which is now available in Garage X at Peter Square .	-5.8627
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Beibegenen " ( 1987 ) with proaminiatures from " Beichnam , his family belonging " ( 2003 ) .	-4.5015
On the largely empty stage - important requirements : a crushed sofa , where intelligently copied and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble hangs through the text material .	-5.5655
Director Fresacher does not seem to trust the text very little in .	-3.7743
The 70-minute performance overwhelms the template with a multitude of direction incidents , known from the repertoire postdramatic forms .	-5.1404
Above all , the actors are sometimes scenic implementations of .	-17.8936
They are tough , dipped with the head under water , tackled with their evening robes to the wall .	-4.4403
Forced in cellophan or songs , they stake on dangerously high plugs through the stage , either monologize them loudly or are completely silenced on stage floor .	-4.9748
The text , however , is hardly conveyed in this strict way .	-3.4121
The best moments have the evening when song - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-4.1291
Only after the end the overturned performance comes somewhat to rest , and Winklers after just absurd humor is flashing .	-5.8482
A Blackbox in the car ?	-1.7397
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe that the solution is found in a small black box that finds each car in the armature board .	-4.3395
The devices that record every kilometer driven and report information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal state planning agencies to revise the outdated system for financing US roads .	-3.9803
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-2.4279
Libertarians have joined environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then using the information to calculate tax models .	-4.9623
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.3741
The US Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.1595
But , while Congress cannot agree on an approach , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.5687
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system for drivers per driven mile over the next decade .	-3.2235
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-1.9466
That really is a must for our country .	-1.8980
“ It is nothing we will only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn of Governments , who plans to record the driven miles in all California drivers in the federal state from 2025 .	-4.2867
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.4951
The technology is there .	-1.7186
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from taxes , is suffering Americans from the zapping column .	-4.6399
But in America , no longer as much tank as before .	-4.0154
Cars use less petrol .	-1.3728
The government tax on mineral oil of 18.4 cents per gallone ( less than 4 euro per litre ) has not risen for 20 years .	-2.8239
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even to a cent , with high prices .	-4.0445
“ The tax on petrol is simply unsustainable , ” said Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.1052
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.7245
“ That is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-2.3568
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user charge .	-2.8572
It is not surprising that the idea is accustomed to urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are being reducin .	-19.7041
The Californian planners rely on the system for drawing up strategies aimed at achieving the ambitious , state-enshrined goals of the federal state for climate change .	-4.3392
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he regards it the most viable long-term alternative .	-17.7423
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also intended to pay drivers after returned route .	-3.6090
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President for Reason directives .	-2.8711
People pay directly for what they receive .	-1.2809
The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers , who had asked Congress to move towards mile-based accounts in a 2011 report .	-3.6941
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year , which would have covered 10,000 cars .	-2.5131
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push , responding to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people , who often have to take many miles on the road to work or town in everyday life .	-6.4742
Several states and big cities , however , are moving in this direction , despite their own fist .	-3.4831
Oregon is the most committed driver currently purchasing 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country .	-3.2010
These drivers will soon pay mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .	-2.7923
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.9437
New York City is also considering such a situation . the the of and the of of .	-16.1701
Illinois tests it with a limited amount of trucks .	-14.8476
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the Transport Ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-3.2890
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.9572
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-3.3593
“ Worries about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” says Alauddin Khan , head of the strategy and result management in the Nevada Transport Ministry .	-3.2262
People did not want it .	-1.3876
When the test arrived , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned : “ It would be relatively easy to transform tachographs into adult monitoring equipment . ”	-2.8918
There is no need to build a gigantic , horrific technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals .	-2.8909
Nevada belongs to a number of states now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the driven kilometers , but not when and where .	-3.8456
With that , Khan , the public would also be more reassured .	-2.7841
Hunting after this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-1.9879
The company has not initially started to help states tax drivers .	-2.6909
Instead , it was their goal to foot into an emerging market for vehicle insurance , where drivers should pay on the basis of the driven miles .	-4.4862
But their tested devices are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is uploaded regularly by modem .	-19.3464
“ People are more willing to participate in it if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage , said .	-3.3635
Some of these public pilot programs have made huge mistakes .	-2.5032
There are considerably cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this . in , the the in the of , and the the in .	-14.3862
In Oregon , the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of choices .	-2.7655
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.2768
Or they choose no device at all and pay a flat-rate fee instead based on the average miles driven by all the state ’ s inhabitants .	-4.7189
Other places hope to sell the concept of a distrusted public by providing the equipment with more functions than with less .	-3.2896
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a device for taxation that also pays parking fees , insurance must be paid only for driven kilometers and speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion .	-5.4034
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages offered by the system , ” says it in a planning document in the city .	-3.5774
However , some transport planners wonder whether the whole talk about payment per mile is not just a huge diversion manoeuvre .	-14.2406
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay officials stated that Congress can solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel taxes .	-3.1242
An additional one-off fee or annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol so that they also pay a fair share .	-15.6990
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of Commission legislation and public affairs .	-19.0735
When we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers care about their privacy and many other things .	-2.8119
Royal Field : Small team beats Wacker	-3.5731
Voluntary fire fighters handled their autumn sample despite lack of personnel with Bravour .	-4.3387
Only eleven man took part in the exercise .	-1.6343
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property of Feder in Burgberger Strasse in his exercise .	-4.3080
There was a shortcut in the saw .	-4.7449
Two people were injured by the emerging fire and smoking development , but one of them was able to send an emergency call .	-3.7771
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two breath-protected workers made prepared to enter the building .	-5.1575
After a short time , it was possible to find the first person and guide the outdoor .	-4.1281
The second person had to be wearing .	-1.6535
This was not easy since a narrow stairway was also to be overcome .	-4.1140
The hotel was not easy to secure a workshop with an integrated design for two horses .	-4.0256
It stored a lot of wood and also wooden bulbs in it .	-2.5492
Furthermore there were electrical machines for wood processing .	-3.4819
The first extinction was done via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.7455
Another management took place over a flurring hydrant in about 100 metres distance .	-5.2206
Three extinction attacks have now been designed .	-3.2999
There was also a hollow tube in the building .	-4.5471
Hans Kammerer also wanted to show what is to be done with little staff at his disposto do . a in .	-21.8450
In case of seriousness , support is carried out on the Königsfeld Day-Bet Group .	-6.1487
The commander was satisfied with the expiration of the exercise .	-2.3883
Interconnection of universities and companies important	-3.1231
At his visit to the Breisgau-High-Black Forest , President Guido Wolf could also inform himself of where tomorrow 's workers come from .	-5.3393
At the Hochschwarzwald School Centre , he followed this important question in conjunction with the managing directors of the professional schools , as well as the circle gymnasium and the chairman of parents .	-7.1537
" Education is an important location factor " , underlined Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma school , which presented the networked educational project Hochschwarzwald .	-3.7142
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education .	-2.8630
Since 2011 , successful cooperation has existed in the Forest City between Forest Centre , Kreisgymnasium and Vocational School Centre .	-4.3948
He also praised family friendliness in the county .	-2.8740
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also to have the phase of caring for members , " Wolf explained due to demographic change .	-5.1837
He also indicated that more and more employees were concerned about the care and care of their families .	-3.9415
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.5439
But nobody can afford to lose qualified workers , he said on .	-2.7097
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-2.3472
" For whoever known the benefits of the region during his studies , with his acquired knowledge and skills often retain the regional economy , which contributes to strengthening the region , " the President of the country showed convinced himself that he had acquired the knoand capabilities .	-15.9733
Only if sufficient training places were offered can the specialist need be met .	-3.7019
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its favourable position in southwest Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-17.9662
In addition , he experienced the efforts already undertaken to develop public transport at Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg on his train ride .	-5.1015
" Stay insistent and ensure that public transport is better " , he explained the address of the local politicians present .	-3.8044
Music Enjoys an Entertaining afternoon	-2.9718
For 15 years the Kaul family has been inviting seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vesper .	-3.2806
In the past , the older fellow citizens were managed in the restaurant .	-3.4077
This afternoon will be held in St. Josef 's maintenance secret .	-4.0860
The inhabitants looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.9261
Later , there was salad of salads .	-15.9953

The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front definition of the old school courtyard at the Kirchstraße ( Churchstraße ) is to be reinstated with the refurbishment cost of the city of Bräunlingen .	-7.1863
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angle wall , stabilization and static discharge of the natural stone wall with Balustrade was built during the first work of the refurbishment of the front school courtyard .	-5.5858
The following approach is to include Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger City Office , the National Development Office in the planning and to create a recovery concept for the old wall .	-6.3873
The subsequent cost calculation will be carried out by experts , who will then be put on the table to the Council of Communities for the decision and establishment of the follow-up .	-6.6084
A decision on this is likely to come next year .	-2.7047
After the renovation , plastering and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the 1912 school , it must be renewed in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure , restoring the needy border wall from scratch and putting new underground .	-6.5991
The historical , one hundred years old dividing wall of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstraße , is mainly due to water and frostal damage , as there is no drainage , needs to be renovated and has an arch newspaper forward .	-6.9176
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently under threat .	-3.2199
A standsafe wall is a prerequisite for a school courtyard used by pupils , which is carried out through the current fortification work .	-4.7305
Originally , the school house renovation was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure delayed a shift . the in the the of the of the of the .	-20.3932
An important word in the historical school renovation , which has even been used for film shots , will speak to the National Discovery Office .	-5.3988
Should requirements come from this site , the city hopes Bräunlingen on subsidies from the protectors of monuments .	-5.2735
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school who are now re-informed in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula can soon use the old school court .	-4.5702
Ozdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart	-2.0699
In the ongoing discussions about the future of music universities in Baden-Württemberg , Cem Özdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now turned on .	-4.1307
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart music school " , said Özdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.4097
Jazz and classic belong to Stuttgart jazz location .	-3.0090
This is contrary to Özdemir , who , in Stuttgart , is regarded as a favorite for a direct mandate in the German election on 22 September , the Green Red Government .	-4.2640
Based on an expert study , this promotes a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.9745
After that , Jazz and Pop will be relocated to the Musikhochschule Mannheim , among others in Germany .	-31.1953
US border : " Super Tunnel " discovered as drug smuggling	-3.3624
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and closed a " super tunnel " for drug smuggling .	-2.5757
As the US tariff authorities have said , the tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks and an ventilation system .	-4.3288
Three suspects were thus arrested , eight tonnes of Marihuana , and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated .	-3.2221
According to the data , the tunnel was not used yet . the was a not . a a a a a to a a a	-15.6535
" These cartels are stupid , if they think they could crack through under the radar , " said the prosecutor of the US district of Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a storehouse in San Diego , where an end to the tunnel was discovered .	-5.0437
Duffy walked about drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.7463
Both the US authorities and Mexican security forces are in a lasting struggle against the drug cartels .	-2.4955
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in relation to drug crime .	-2.2858
Constructed by experts	-1.4286
Due to the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that they were constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took approximately a year .	-4.3349
The rooms were equipped with electrically operated cars .	-4.0852
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building 80 meters from the border .	-16.8869
According to the authorities , a head of 20 meters leads to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.2438
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters altitude and 90 centimetre width .	-14.2228
He would have been able to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-2.9693
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the Cocaine Fund .	-1.7832
The third , a Mexican , was taken because of the confiscated Marihuana .	-2.8197
All three threatens to be the maximum penalty of lifelong freedom , as officials have said .	-3.6010
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , at the press conference in San Diego , it continued to be to be discoin the fu.	-15.8427
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction .	-2.7355
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not tunnels .	-2.1665
This shows the " despair " of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said about drug trafficking DEA in San Diego .	-3.9932
They would do everything they can to get to the US .	-14.9880
No details were announced on the arrested , at least one of Mexicans , it was .	-3.3801
They must expect prison sentences up to ten years .	-2.4805
Geinger Festival 2014	-2.4291
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.7287
Return of the first historical mention is getting closer and closer .	-3.3138
When the year ends in good eight weeks , the anniversary is about to come to an end .	-4.3669
Heisingen and church houses were first mentioned 794 together .	-3.4204
A document was made in churches where both places are mentioned .	-2.5048
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and as hostages currently have no hall , this event will take place in the place where both first mentioned 1250 years ago , church houses .	-6.2245
A number of events are planned during the anniversary , both in hospitals and in church homes .	-4.5364
Church houses will be the 1250 festive weekend of July 18 to 20 .	-4.5550
Celebrate again .	-0.8160
On Friday with a festive act , on Saturday and Sunday with a celebration around the church hall .	-3.0945
At this fixed weekend , the Church House is also the Church Festival .	-5.4281
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city during the Jubilee , which is listed at three dates .	-4.6241
On June 21 , together with the Sonnwendfeier of the Black Forest Association , on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of town music in the new festival hall .	-4.9207
This is finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date is on September 27 and 28 September .	-4.3254
On the occasion of the Geisinger city jubilee , a new chronicle is being brou.	-17.3417
" But it should be a chronic not only of hostages themselves , but a printed work about the hostages of today , which is precisely made up of hostages , church houses , body houses , carrots , and goodmadings , " says Walter Hengstler .	-7.0037
And today ’ s hostage celebrates 2014 birthday , in 1974 , today ’ s space was completed with the individuals .	-4.9418
The new Chronic will be presented in the new festival in hostages on 21 or 22 November .	-4.1347
However , 2014 is another year with many anniversaries .	-3.2909
Strohglonki Narrenzuft begins on February 8 , with a custom environment at its 60-year-old existence , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will celebrate the Festival Banquet on March 29 and will celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-7.3218
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new site for 50 years and will celebrate this on May 10 , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and will celebrate this in the framework of the fountain feast of July 4th to 7th .	-13.7757
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a document owned by the St. Gallen monastery in 764 .	-22.8830
The document was made in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court .	-2.9045
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.0920
In 2014 , this 1250-year-old celebration is due to be celebrated , and the in the the of the of . the of the of , , the , , the , , the , and , , , the , , , , the ,	-29.5607

Should the transition " Am Hirschen " be converted carefully to increase traffic safety ?	-3.5101
Yes , the municipal councils decided .	-15.9339
Shieltach must take EUR 220 000 in hand for this .	-4.0570
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-1.9285
In particular , the safety of railway transitions is to be increased - collisions of trains with other vehicles are regularly collised throughout .	-22.7677
If communities vote in favour of reconstruction , they must participate in the cost of one third , the rest share the railway and the federal state .	-4.9918
Schiltachs ' town tree master Roland Greethower explained the specific characteristics of the railway pass " Am Hirschen " .	-17.6050
There the city plans to build a book in the amount of tunnelling in the west of the railway track .	-5.6282
There , too , larger vehicles , such as those carrying long-wood , could stand by counter-traffic , without having to block the track . the flethe flethe of the of the . the the the the of the the the	-22.6362
Greetholders therefore proposed to construct a necessary backwall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth transport flow .	-4.5740
This was controversially discussed in the Council , as some councils cast doubt on the need for road spread : Thomas Kipp , with his statement , put the critics ' mood on the point : ' Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles ? '	-6.4576
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : Train passage " Hirschen " is used regularly for long-wood transportation .	-3.5507
Even wood from the Kuhbach area is partly transported through this route , because the vehicles up to 20 meters could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn to the main road .	-5.3706
Furthermore , the route serves as a discharge for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel if the main road is blocked , Haas argued .	-4.1292
Since it is predictable that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel should be rebuilt and refurbished , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the train pass " Am " Hirschen " could also have an important road for a longer period of time . to the to to to to to to to to to . to the to to to a a a	-20.3826
The councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause road broadcasting .	-4.5086
Regardless of this , the majority agreed to rebuild the railway transition by means of the necessary support wall in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstraße " where appropriate for meetings to around 5.5 meters .	-6.5070
The rebuilding of the railway transition in the Trautwine domain could lead to a very different problem affecting access to the heavily rising " geroltzhäuser path " .	-6.6211
The administration had left the railway conversion plans from the Breinlinger engineering office , because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser path was then easily possible .	-5.8658
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not to be excluded that the street ’ s tendency could lead to longer vehicles rising .	-5.5798
The city is responsible for this in turn as a carrier for road construction .	-5.0188
The reconstruction could therefore cause liability disputes .	-3.7120
Because both the wood export and the turning in the current state of expansion were working , Haas argued .	-6.3141
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of train with a transitional vehicle is significantly lower than the other railway transitions , because directly next to the centre stop , to which there is a good connection .	-6.3237
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed down here so far that no collision threatens .	-4.2984
The majority of people refused to rebuild this transition , because the city of Schiltach had to " battle the problem with supervisory vehicles " , so the councils could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction was completed .	-7.5557
The body considers unproblematic the transition to railway transitions ' in front of Heubach ' and ' Before Kuhbach ' , for which cross-road agreements have already been reached .	-6.1923
Esa decides on billions of space missions : Missions for billions	-15.4561
Far from planets , gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years .	-3.2072
30 proposals were selected , five are still in the race .	-2.4876
Far worlds .	-0.6444
Astronomers have already found more than 1000 planets on other stars .	-2.1544
No one knows whether there is life at least on some of them .	-17.2507
The selection is hard : Should you look for gravitation waves ?	-2.8975
Or prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-2.6429
Or after similar planets , and thus perhaps discover outside life ?	-4.0120
These questions are precisely those responsible for the European Space Agency .	-3.0117
For their programme " Cosmic Vision " they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make progress on research .	-4.1053
The budget for such ' L missions ' is about one billion euros each .	-2.7273
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.9740
In early September in Paris , the elite of European space research met to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.1601
30 ideas were discussed , five of them have now come to a closer choice .	-2.9696
Many bodies considered the proposals , hacking with researchers .	-4.3507
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-2.7036
Overall , four major questions have selected the Esa to find answers to the missions of the 2007 Cosmic Vision programme .	-3.5242
What are the conditions for creating planets and life ?	-14.5503
The exact processes of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and hence also the creation of planets circulating these stars - are still in proverbial darkness .	-4.6341
A big infrared scope in all may penetrate this dark .	-3.0874
And if a star has planet under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-2.4643
To follow this question , the space telescope " Cheops " will be launched in 2017 , with which 500 already known planetary systems will be examined more closely in our surroundings .	-4.8180
However , the possibilities are limited , cheops are a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.3894
With larger instruments , astronomers could display similar planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , seeking " biomarkers " : gases that are considered indicative of biological activity .	-3.7313
How does the solar system work ?	-0.9488
This question , too , should ultimately provide an indication of the conditions for the creation of life .	-4.8580
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field , as well as the particle radiation it emerges with the planet system .	-4.0459
In our solar system these processes can be examined in an exemplary manner .	-3.7829
With the " Solar Orbiter " the Esa has already granted a mission of the M class ( there the budget is approximately half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-3.8736
The Sonde is to start in 2017 and watch the Sun 's surface and activity carefully .	-15.4958
Researchers are also of great interest to Jupiter and his moon .	-3.3410
You want to know what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-2.7576
For this , the Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program in .	-18.2108
The Sonde " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) will start their journey probably 2022 .	-3.3967
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and was intended to study the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.6513
What are the fundamental physical laws of the universe ?	-1.1020
The spa offers many opportunities to study material under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws that we know are still valid there .	-4.6105
Perhaps there are also differences that could lead the physicians to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .	-4.2920
How did the universe develop and what exists ?	-2.9004
Our cosmos came from the banner 13.7 billion years ago .	-3.0741
In addition to the gravity of galaxies and galaxy clusters , the stars , planets and live creatures we consist of , there are dark matter whose gravity is coherent with galaxies and galaxy clusters , and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of space .	-6.5881
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the bankruptcy , nor are dark matter and dark energy .	-4.2687
With " Euclid " the Esa has already approved an M mission to start for 2020 .	-3.7548
With a special telescope , the probe is to investigate the distribution of material in the universe for the first time throughout the sky , allowing conclusions on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-5.5575
Making the Race	-2.9389
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain in the end of the selection process .	-1.8955
In the opinion of many experts , " E-Lisa " , the best opportunity to grant a L-mission is to prove gravitational waves .	-5.0940
These include physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-2.9496
They have not been proven to date .	-2.1423
Elisa could do that , hoping scientists behind the project .	-2.3657
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three profiles , which is stationed in all .	-4.6680
In contrast to plants on earth , it could also prove gravitational waves created at the background and thus provide new insights about the creation of the cosmos .	-5.8914
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is to explore , among other things , black holes , " Icy Planet " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " that is to track and examine similar planets .	-5.2470
Among other things , suggestions on the transport of samples from Mars , research into moon , venus and asteroids as well as sun physics have already been dismisin the , am. the the and the the the the the the the the the the the	-20.4496
Snowden willing to “ cooperate with Germany in US surveillance ”	-2.2950
Edward Snowden , the Whistleblower of the US Security Service , has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and tell us before the German Bundestag when the American National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities .	-4.0972
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum has received to discuss the statement in Germany .	-3.6514
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , this writes : “ Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive , my government continues to treat a different opinion as a faithful break and attempts to criminalise political expression with a threat of impunity , which cannot be defended . ”	-6.5813
True to say , however , is not a crime .	-1.7776
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support could convince the American Government to deny the charge against him . the of the of and the of .	-13.7240
The charge issued by the US Department of Justice includes spy and theft of state ownership .	-2.9888
The German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said online : “ If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives , we find ways to make that possible . ”	-3.6605
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that NSA has listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.0699
Thomas Oppermann , who chaired the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should seize the opportunity to hear snowden as witnesses if it is possible to “ threaten without him and completely ruin relations with the US . ”	-5.3026
Ströbele , a Member of the Greens , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his twitter feed .	-2.3058
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.6785
Ströbele stated that , according to the lawyer of former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he left the country .	-3.3192

Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-1.2074
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to $ 100 of passengers wishing to store their hand baggage on their flight . flights are up to up to to $in the . a fronof of of flflight . the flithe of	-20.3947
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to US $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday was to be read that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-4.0793
The new fee is valid for hand baggage above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-3.0284
Frontier explained that one calculates US $ 25 when paid in advance , and US $ 100 for travellers who only paid on the flight .	-5.3167
Frontier spokesman Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of US $ 100 is aimed at moving travelers in advance of payment .	-4.0323
“ We do not want to charge this sum , ” she explained .	-2.4893
Airlines began in 2008 to charge the first and second baggage pieces .	-3.4042
Passengers trying to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into the hand baggage , which means that the baggage fields are often overflooded above the seat .	-5.6223
Fees are one way to get passengers less on board .	-2.5279
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-2.1426
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier , who would have expressed clearly that it would be increasingly difficult to find place above the seat .	-4.2474
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-2.5531
This means that a passenger may carry a baggage free of charge on the flight , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a similar baggage .	-4.1193
O 'Malley declared that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they came to flight .	-3.8364
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will not enter into force until summer , there is no exact date yet .	-3.6054
Passengers frequently vaccinate about baggage supplements and other charges , but airlines are happy to return to them .	-5.2015
They argue that the transport of luggage costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-3.1111
Many at Wall Street regard new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover airlines after years of loss .	-3.1627
However , most of them have so far left the fingers of charges for hand baggage .	-3.8364
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first fees for hand baggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air followed a low-cost aircraft as well .	-3.5094
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-21.7709
He estimated in a December 2011 report that Spirit ’ s hand baggage fee costs US $ 50 million annually . a dola lot .	-16.7361
Sorensen , who used to hold a leading position in Midwest Airlines , has recently flown spirit and was curious to expect him to confront passengers with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-4.6146
“ The boarding process was one of the smooth ones I experienced in my career , ” he said .	-2.5917
I expected to see teeth cherries and handy discussions on the flight .	-3.0873
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding was lubricated . ”	-3.1188
Frontier also follows the $ 2 required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.8748
The company explained that passengers bought limonade or juice , who are allowed to keep the whole dose and that coffee is filled free of charge .	-5.3383
Water remains free of charge .	-1.0215
In 2008 , US Airways tried to demand money for refreshing drinks , but reversed seven months later , after passengers had complained and no other major society was involved .	-4.8875
Frontiers step to charge hand baggage fees if passengers do not buy directly to the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-4.0195
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per saled ticket .	-15.0502
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to purchase direct with them instead of an online travel agency .	-3.6210
Frontier has , however , gone far beyond this .	-2.8352
In September , the company began to award only half of the numerous miles when booking via an online travel agency .	-4.2158
On Wednesday , miles were reduced to 25 % of the route .	-1.9779
A third-party air travel with frontier over 1000 miles therefore introduces customers only 250 miles .	-4.5989
Passengers may also book seats for direct purchases on the Frontier Square website .	-4.0769
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver , but business shrinks and the company loses money .	-2.5839
The revenue fell by 9 % , and air capacity shrunk by just under 13 percent in the first quarter , as was read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the mother tongue , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-17.9476
Republic tried to bring the finances of frontier under the sale of society to contro.	-17.5211
The Bible ’ s Lessons	-2.3312

The topic of the day in the municipal house was " speeches from the Bible " and " Middle Agesp" " " " " " " " " " " " " " " "	-13.8085
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the Church Community Council , went to the biblical proverb after breakfast .	-3.6398
" Speeches contained lifestyles , rules or warnings , " she explained .	-4.1699
It compared to several proverbal words with the relevant bible points and explained the importance .	-3.7770
She called proverb words like : wooden eyes are vigilant , as scraps of the eyes fall , a eye on someone who gives the Lord in sleep his hands wash in innocence .	-17.1843
On several occasions , the referent also advised her listeners what proverb it was .	-4.3991
The Middle Ages ’ speeches took Christel Dehner on board : All good things are three , blue , slightly sc.	-5.8195
It explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.7715
In conclusion , a tombola was lost .	-1.9904

Learning Unemployed Pilot Project for Unlearned Tourism	-2.8330
Today , a pilot project for the tourism industry starts at the Mecklenburgian lake plate .	-3.7055
Guided by the Federal Working Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unlearned in the industry are to be qualified over three winters towards professionals for hotels and restaurants .	-4.7149
" New is that the six-month courses with qualifications , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Working Agency .	-3.9318
The benefit is diverse : participants would not be unemployed by trained professionals who were lacking ever more in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-4.9830
The project also contributes to the industrial and commercial chamber in Neubrandenburg and the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg Vorpomern .	-3.8225
NSA declares that “ internal mistakes ” and not hackers are to blame the crash of the website .	-3.3050
The shady National Security Agency declared late Friday , a mistake has paralysed its public website several hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-3.8384
“ NSA.gov was not accessible for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update ” , the spy agency explained in an e-mail message .	-4.1625
The problem will be resolved this evening .	-1.7029
The claim that the failure has been caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDOS ) is not true .	-17.1514
In the early evenings , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was unavailable for at least six hours and that is still not available for some users .	-4.0995
Previously , a NSA spokesman had declared to ABC News that the Authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.0834
Secret information is not in danger , so the speaker .	-2.1189
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.1582
In such attacks , the target website will be flooded with calls until the servers are overloaded and the website collapsed .	-3.4468
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the internal network of the target system .	-2.5545
The previously supersecret NSA , whose leadership was No Such Agency ( No Such Agency ) , is now found in the bright light of the public and is exposed to sharper criticism of its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data that has been stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employees , Edward Snowden .	-6.3438
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation about the incident today being the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-4.3244
The number of people without jobs in October has fallen easily from 22 to 1.307 .	-13.3891
While the quota is 3.1 % better than last year , and better than in September , " we had hoped for more " , Monika Felder-Bauer says , Vice-Chairman of the Agency for Working in Sonthofen .	-4.7015
Many companies have so far reacted to attitudes .	-3.5085
One reason is according to Felder-Bauer : " We have hardly any professionals in craft , health care , and elderly care " .	-4.8606

Profit losses at Bombardier following decline in supply numbers and orddelidentials in the .	-15.0172
The Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturer Bombardier Inc announced a 15-percent decline in net profit on Thursday , after pressuring him under pressure by declining orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway sector .	-5.1552
Bombardier , based in Montreal , has not published any flight data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-5.3819
On the jungle flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , only three more starts were followed , which leaves it doubtful whether the test phase runs as planned .	-4.8410
The results have fallen short of the forecasts , leading to a fall of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-4.2838
Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered its review from “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” with a view to ensuring that shares have a limited spending potential in the next one to two quarters .	-4.3961
“ Although weaker aircraft deliveries were expected to a large extent , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” Docks said in a letter of customers .	-5.0695
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft test program is progressing .	-3.1206
If , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-3.1085
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can catapult the company to the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.3508
The first aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay .	-3.1305
But , so far , binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate , as potential buyers wait for the results of the aircraft tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new nozzle aircraft are accurate .	-4.9148
Currently , there are 403 orders and promises of 15 customers and companies .	-2.4833
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-2.7719
The company ’ s management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme is in the timetable .	-4.3293
“ The test aircraft has no longer stayed on the floor than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft ’ s standing , software updates were used .	-5.4753
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.9823
We have decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period , as we have done .	-3.7408
That is what is happening throughout the programme .	-3.3421
The second of five test aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks , the remaining remaining , namely that of the company .	-4.7773
However , analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the jungle flight the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft .	-3.6271
Bombardier explained that it checked the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-3.2203
“ The slow progress of the flight tests – even if they obviously correspond to bombardiers of internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Docsen .	-5.0053
In the third quarter , at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cent per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-3.8235
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents unchanged .	-2.2729
Sales slightly fallen from $ 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.7061
Analysts had expected 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4.56 billion , said Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.3568
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer states that he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-3.1181
The net establishments fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-2.5311
The contract stock in the aerospace and space parts was $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , thereby unchanged from 31 December .	-4.5600
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were within the framework of our requirements , but the low order intake and market relations as a whole were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-3.7216
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 % to two billion dollars .	-2.4735
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this divide have risen by just under 11 billion dollars .	-3.3482
The order book in the transport part was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , which was slightly increased compared to December 31 .	-4.0814
The transport profit margin has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-2.6617
According to company management , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter .	-2.8132
In the afternoon trading on Thursday , the bombing share reached 8.5 percent and was 4.83 Canadian dollars after it was announced that the Google Financial Board Patrick Pichette will change to the board .	-5.3790

Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss before police investigation must take prison .	-3.4348
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information on the underworld size Neil Scarborough further .	-3.0031
The lawyer was afraid that his secret dependence on drugs could come to light .	-2.4648
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpooler Crown Court .	-1.8172
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against major police investigation because he was afraid of discovering his secret drug addiction was sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.8632
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about its activities in drug trafficking after being compromised by his own coca search .	-3.6114
In 2011 , the lawyer of criminalists as “ first-class ” was arrested in his house after the police had monitored Scarborough , which he represented in an earlier drug process .	-5.4378
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) three Beutel Kokain at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , delivered while he was with colleagues at a meal of the Attorney Chamber .	-4.6998
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs of class A after tests traces of cocaine in his hair , his wallet and credit cards were found .	-3.6793
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to provide unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.6874
All four suspects were monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation procedure on heroin and coca trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.3368
Together with 32 others , they were arrested later after the police secured a number of Heroin and Cocain in the value of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash .	-4.6011
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared his dependence on drugs could become public .	-14.7940
Today Ditta , who works for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn , was found and condemned at Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for disability of the judiciary .	-4.3048
He gave cocaine ownership in a previous survey .	-2.9374
The lawyer was transferred after the police investigated Scarborough that , in February 2011 , he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta .	-3.9264
Two investigation officials followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas House and put drugs under the lawyer ’ s waste tonne with a purity of 60 % in a black golf shoe .	-4.7369
Shortly after having delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly called Ditta , who was in the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .	-3.3922
The lawyer returned home , drugs came and nine messages were exchanged between the two .	-3.4648
Prior to court , Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocain after tests drugs of class A had been discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-4.0531
Ditta was arrested later , but disputed to take cocaine and said that he was talking to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that her discussion is subject to the “ secret of lawyer ” .	-4.6544
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were assured and a hair test was taken .	-3.7406
He stated at the police interrogation that he would call him at home for legal matters , both under his private address and at the workplace . , he , , , , , , and , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , and	-26.6678
The court known that he called for important drug trafficking players , some of whom he had previously represented , for major arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them .	-5.0475
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-12.3815
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , as he has invited himself to a very specific client .	-4.3379
The relationship in question is not just a drug dealer , but a drug trafficker who provides his lawyer with drugs .	-2.7847
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-3.1479
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-12.4042
It opposed police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to follow their criminal activities .	-3.6163
Mr Ditta thus discredited his profession .	-2.1564
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-1.7967
Ditta pointed out any misconduct and claimed , “ If I was a corrupt lawyer , which I am not and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-4.7080
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the move from one criminal to a criminal at the moment when he began to purchase drugs from organised criminals . ”	-4.0022
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromise , and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-3.9650
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide confidence and confidence in the public .	-1.8690
Ditta has lagged this trust and tried to conceal himself behind the facade of his profession .	-3.5687
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to condemnation in three cases due to the possession of cocaine and judicial impairment , underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.4451
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that none of them can escape the arm of the law .	-2.7029
We will find you and bring you to the court .	-2.0960
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after guilty of the conspiracy of heroin , cocaine and cannabis trading .	-2.6364
Thirty more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total of 153 years for drug offences .	-3.5796
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity .	-4.9067

On Saturday 26 October , this extraordinary exhibition will be listened to at the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf during the evening exhibition in St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 October .	-4.5497

The trade fair is listed in the context of the services of God , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.1077
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the Bleser Group of Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ .	-3.2962
Haslach : Skepticism is gradually Scepticism	-4.7049
The 2015 elections will change fundamentally in the Haslach ( SE ) maritime un, , , , for , for example the elecin in the of the 20, the of of of , the of	-15.4056
Then there is only one common parish council for all six parties . in the , there is a a common in in the .	-20.7242
In a joint session on Saturday , the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschenstein prepared for the changes .	-3.2435
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.9192
Over the course of the day , it became especially clear that skepticism towards the new is bound to be hesitant but increasingly confident .	-4.9634
From the ideas and expectations of innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on future composition and the size of the parish community , the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsory Team were enough .	-5.2827
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained , with a presentation , the newly drafted guidelines for sailing units in the archdiocese of Freiburg .	-4.2805
In future , the SE Haslach , as a church community , is a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .	-4.5559
There will only be a joint parish committee and a foundation board where the parish force is represented .	-4.2091
Each parish will represent at least two elected members , in which six parties will be formed on the ground .	-4.7540
Their task will in future be to promote church life in the place .	-3.1829
The question of the finances of the individual parish community was substantially needed for talks .	-3.9339
The innovations indicate that collected credit is preserved for purposes in the parish .	-5.4983
On the other hand , liabilities are on the community as a whole .	-3.1583
There have been major concerns , particularly with regard to the major planned investment , the obligation to which all parties will then be made .	-5.5815
" Also in the past , only projects that were managed by the individual parish alone were invested in " , relative Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-5.3927
Practical experience with a common body for five paths described Barbar Ritter , the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald Neuried Schutterwald .	-14.3600
They had done their job in 2006 , " One is going to remain five " and they had to say that it is not that simple .	-5.7504
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorgy Unit then asked to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the joint parish communautaire and the practical work of the communal teamand communal tein the fuin .	-22.7447
The drafts will be concretized at other meetings and will be adopted at another six-body sitting next spring .	-5.2248
At the end , Michael Schöner presented the new logo of the Seelsory Unit , which was agreed by a clear majority .	-4.4118
In Pfullendorf , electricity becomes more expensive	-2.9011
The citizens of pullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-2.8952
As the director of the town , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed pullendorfer family family will add 70 to 90 euros per year .	-5.5665
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.6787
Each year in October , this modification will be redefined by the four operators of the large electricity trasses .	-18.3299
These are the additional costs incurred by the energy transition , which they can collect through a levy above the electricity price .	-5.4518
The city works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-2.8915
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Energy Company has even assumed a higher level , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.9950
Now the specific numbers would have to be calculated before the city works could inform their customers about the precise price increase next week .	-4.5513
" We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , said Bias , where the number is close to the 2 cents .	-3.5099
Light on Duration : Eight On Waiting Age	-4.9170
Sometimes a traffic light is not green .	-1.3658
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the lightning is broken .	-2.9506
What should you do then - go to red ?	-3.4024
Has a person waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorcycle " .	-3.9770
The waiting time must be " reasonable " , which may vary from case to case .	-3.8066
Becker advises to remain at least five minutes before the traffic light is disrupted .	-4.0697
However , if you continue the journey despite red lights , you must be aware that it is the full blame for an accident caused by it .	-5.1584
Those who tolerate less than five minutes may not be waiting long enough , Becker refers to a decision by the Hamm Supreme Court .	-3.5262
In the case of negotiations , a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes and had to take responsibility for a negligent breach of red light .	-3.9660
The traffic light was not defective , but was little later around the green .	-4.1956
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation , but he did not penalise money .	-4.8404
Joint Council is looking forward to sound budgets	-3.4562
Whenever the budget is local , mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-2.7250
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known any more since 2005 .	-3.8066
The 2012 financial year can also be recorded as a full success in this sense .	-3.1157
This became clear in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts .	-2.6600
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was higher than planned .	-3.0576
The surplus of the administrative budget , too , is roughly EUR 1.8 million , above the appro.	-17.0573
The surplus is mainly due to higher income taxation and the community 's share in income tax .	-4.1368
The asset budget was also clear again about the planned values .	-2.5264
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-1.8626
" This is essentially due to the higher introduction of the administrative budget , " says Rothmund .	-3.4010
As investment has been made less than planned in the 2012 financial year , savings inflation has been higher .	-5.2152
Overall , the overall reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to EUR 4.9 million now .	-2.9100
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work .	-1.6025
" So a work does not simply shake out of the sleeves , " praised Gerster with a view to the annual accounts .	-4.3910
He and the municipalities were pleased with the good figures .	-3.4985
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens may soon be expensive .	-3.3831
The good financial position enabled the community to avoid high levels in the past .	-3.6861
This , in turn , has already been reduced by the country , according to Gerster , subin . the the the the of of of .	-20.5913
There are requirements for these grants from various compensatory blocks .	-3.8142
Among other things , cities and communities requesting grants must show certain leverages .	-3.5015
" We must look at the issue of leverage since investments are in the years to come , for which we would like to have subsidies , " said Gerster in this context .	-5.2538

He received several awards for his commitment and intelligence : Jörg Kohr , Pastoral Referent , on behalf of the Cäcile Association of Rottenburg Stuttgart , given that the Choir is also a church choir , a certificate of the association and a honor brief signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince .	-5.5495

The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan population " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " by Antos Gus in foreign countries , while the " Impulschor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " belonged to her program .	-4.2758
The singer department of the Baisinger Sports Association came back to home , where the Fullmaringer Music Association offered crowning musical completion .	-5.7607

One that invites you to stay and come back again .	-3.1352
One that wants to make the name of the program .	-1.6541
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu refers to a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of experiencing or seeing a new situation .	-4.1612
In the case of visiting the same named café at the Opschlag in the city of Kleve in vision to the Rhine-Waal University , it must not remain the pure feeling of Déjà Vu .	-5.4634
After all , the café has a beautiful name for the purpose : to make a real stay not only thankful but repeatedly experienced .	-6.2543
Because it 's just fun and is just beautiful .	-3.8595
A look into the inner life on Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at the bottom of .	-5.1958
The state-of-the-art , but not cool café environment looks like a place to feel well-.	-4.1643
Here , the team with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner pampers the guest with a variety of coffee or cocktail variants .	-4.4383
There are also delicious cakes or individually stocked fresh baguettes .	-3.7398
The holders , both 33 years old , were already named at the opening of the jewellery café on Opschlag as a gastronomer : In Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-5.8590
From moving to Kleve to Opschlag , the sympathetic café lovers expect more audience .	-3.3757
Not least also through the university .	-16.7752
" While we do not have a specific target group " , Daniel Büttner emphasises .	-2.7565

Two events also played at the bright café .	-3.1408
Better said one .	-2.0935
The harbour festival was rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-3.5985
But there was also the ring nat-night evening .	-3.2757
" Beautiful , successful and fun " , the two 33 year-olds found .	-2.6853
But not everyone ’ s cause .	-2.4983
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a special fan of event evenings : " You cannot do everything right " .	-4.9132
And with an event I always address only those interested in the special event .	-2.9453
Events will therefore be the exception to us .	-2.5030

They have been included in the final draft document adopted by global leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit . the doin and the the of in .	-21.3116

“ I am pleased that the member states agreed to address a process with which universal , sustainable development goals are to be agreed , ” he said .	-3.5914
“ These objectives will be built on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 framework .	-2.7284
I will not spare any efforts to implement this mandate given to me by the member states to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.1896

Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about that .	-2.2541
Everyone is still fully motivated on the subject .	-2.6399
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.3016
" For I no longer know how such a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-3.7993
Although the third liga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet outsourced trees , Malmon is warning of the pointing finger .	-5.4651
Many players have still trained in A-Youth .	-2.6659
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-2.7457
" Additionally , it is necessary to wait for the first time to reinforce the SG-Coach .	-5.5938
To return to success at long last , the Malmon team must certainly increase compared to the past performances .	-4.3275

Therefore , I hope that my players have finally got their head free during the short break .	-20.6830
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-2.1776
Thousands of people gathered together in the centre of Maputos under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and first president of Mozambique to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace calls .	-3.9234
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.0525
Fear of the country ’ s future , it has exchanged its business clothing against a T-shirt with the label “ We call for security ” in Portuguese and joined the quantity on the capital ’ s independence square on Thursday .	-5.3415
For two weeks , there have been nearly daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.9429
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White Rhodesia , and later the apartment government of South Africa , in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.1398
Following the 1992 peace agreement , it became an opposition party .	-2.0000
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country has returned to a balanced conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.8888
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because discovering huge gas deposits in the north-west coal and coal camps could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion of companies like Rio Tinto , vales from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US in the coming years .	-5.0250
The ruling Frelimo party , since 1975 , has been dominating power , and Renamo is mutually blaming tensions .	-3.6787
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional Hochburg Renamos on 17 October .	-2.3114
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , declared Renamos Speakers to the Financial Times .	-3.1614
The government blames Renamo for the collapse , accusing the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.1643
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.7533
With regard to AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama wants to consider himself a “ loser ” that “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.5250
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.7191
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was cited with the words , Renamo has given up the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.1543
He stated to the FT , so he meant that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement .	-3.3613
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations , and even if serious , ” said Mazanga .	-2.9871
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fired by a number of collapses this year .	-18.3658
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who meet the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , Docent at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.2179
None of them is good in negotiations and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.3691
Renamo , which is pushing for electoral reforms , has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.6712
Presidential and parliamentary elections are scheduled for next year .	-1.8650
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt by a sick movement to reach concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.1832
Renamo ’ s electoral successes have been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Moviento de Moçambique ( MDM ) , will probably improve in elections .	-3.6115
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation will be when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.3835
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to abandon the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.5842
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection .	-3.8803
Most battles took place in the province of Sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , where Beira is located , use the port , mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-4.2915
In June , Rio interrupted the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-2.6944
Mazanga replied cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat .	-2.4571
Renamo wanted to warn “ the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-1.8917
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , sluggish progress in development and a recent kidnapping wave .	-3.5901
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he says .	-14.7843
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.8125
“ No one interested Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-3.0101
Children should get myths and legends as “ models for life ” means an author .	-2.6075
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance of clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.8066
Many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too dirty , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of ancient works .	-4.2643
“ I find it wonderful that in America , myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-1.9703
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.1071
He added that for authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ completely disable ” , because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ under-threshold . ”	-4.7869
Crossley Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon Saxon , and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , explained : “ You can persecute certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-3.9056
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to give hope .	-2.9021
Not everything must be simplified or leading to Happy End , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.8493
It must be underlying , revealing history and not explaining .	-3.9875
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-2.2136

Their maintenance subsequently made the Three-Kingdom singers who caused Hansjakob to say : " Oh how beautiful , there are again young memories of my own triangle " .	-7.0692
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the storch-day children with their noisy " Point , Point " .	-5.5332
Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the Official Church at the time as well as his concerns about agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialisation or the impact of war .	-4.3805
In the home , behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his rest site .	-23.3771

Many applause and many commendable words were performed by the audience .	-2.9665

Court blocks decision on the NYPD stop-and-hazard directive	-2.8469
A federal appeal court in the US , on Thursday , blocked a judge calling for changes to the stop-and-frisk program ( “ Anhalt and Search ” ) of the New York police partment , and abandoned the judge of the case .	-4.9344
The second US Appeal Court declared that judge Shira Scheindlin 's decisions would be subject to decisions until an appeal of the city was decided .	-4.1741
The judge had judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the programme for personal personnel ’ s personal personal personal personal personnel is implemented .	-7.4784
The city laid down appeal against its assessment and the corresponding remedies , including the decision to set up a surveillance centre to help the police change their directive and training programme .	-5.4729
The Appeal Court heard the arguments on Tuesday for suspension .	-2.0797

The judge had judged that police officers violate the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they improperly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-frisk program .	-3.3560

Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop-and-Frisk programme , the changes will end unfair practices , create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way in which other police presidents use the regulation .	-4.8182
Opponents believe that change would dampen the morality of the police , but not crime ; it would also waste money and not resolve the broader problem of a police force under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of posts in the last decade .	-4.7120
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-harisk practice that was constitutional , but only reform the kind of implementation of controls by the NYPD .	-3.7924

Coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip	-2.9108
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly called “ telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation ” to confirm an incorrect tip on an affair by the then Interior Minister , Charles Clarke .	-4.5338
Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in Old Bailey , News of the World in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.2131
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and pursued her , but Coulson also called her and left news , such as the Court left .	-4.5684
“ According to the Public Prosecutor , Coulson , who is now publisher of NotW , nobody who is facing the apartment of people and hopes to tap them in fresh deed , but one who likes to face a story to see their response , ” said Edi .	-5.4995
He said NotW uses three procedures to investigate stories : telephone hacking , monitoring and confrontation .	-2.6427
The editor is personally involved in the third method .	-1.2012
Obviously he knows of the second , monitoring , and otherwise it cannot be .	-3.5769
What about the first time ?	-2.3898
Does he know about the phone hacking notification ?	-1.9555
He disputes this , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-2.7856
Rumours about an affair clarkes were first taken up by NotW ’ s feature editorial , when a source sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , it is together with Charles . ”	-4.1066
A voicemail band from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire ’ s apartment in August 2006 .	-3.0504
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer , on which Pawlby and her sisters were saved as “ projects ” .	-16.4872
At the time when the search was run , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edeabout about the the the of the of . the prothe of the of and the of the of of the of the of the of of the of of	-33.4555
Meanwhile , former Chief Reporter Neville Thurlbeck and the former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby .	-2.9769
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to talk about with Charles . ”	-14.1429
Edis declared that Coulson ’ s activities at this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-3.3970
The voices heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett had confronted with an affair with a married woman when he was lied even with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at that time .	-4.8994
Coulson and Brooks argue to have confused with others to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-3.4812

Opportunity : No absolute protecpossible	-13.3804
" We want to integrate the inhabitants into the planning at an early stage , " Mayor Jens Häußler opened the citizens ' information event to the flood protection concept in Geichingen .	-4.2953
Around 80 participants came into the communal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and ideas .	-4.3509
Häußler made it clear : ' The ultimate decisions are the members of the Council of Communities ' .	-3.7504
The flood water , which met Gechingen on May 15 , 2009 , was a drastic event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , says householders .	-4.5167
A survey of the river was commissioned with neighbouring Aidlingen , which is now based on the concept of flood protection in Gechingen .	-3.9872
" The protection of as many land products as possible is the objective " , said Häußler .	-3.7437
The planning of protection against a German weather service is based on statistically every 100 years to expect flood .	-3.6361
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent surcharge .	-2.2637
In specialist circles this is called HQ 100aKlima .	-2.6768
The water masses that caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 100-year-old floo.	-16.8426
" There is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement can be achieved " , said householders .	-3.1886
In order to protect the HQ 100aKlima , around EUR 4 million must be invested in Geingen , and the municipality can expect around 70 % of the country ’ s subsidies .	-5.3757
Häußler pointed out , however , that promotion only applies if an overall concept is implemented .	-3.9093
To this end , the community needs the participation of the citizens .	-3.8724
Expensive planning and approval procedures must be completed .	-2.7221
In the best case , 2016 can be implemented .	-2.4571
Among other things , the concept of protection , which was already presented in the municipal Council last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the influx of the Irm river from the Heimer Valley .	-4.4643
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to introduce their concerns .	-2.6908
Among other things , the question was why no more dams and restraint basins were planned to protect the place .	-3.5636
Gregor Kühn , professional planner of the commissioned engineering agency Forest and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it required the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the am.	-16.8503
In addition , one can find the most economical solution , such as Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-4.3007
There was displeasure among those who suffered from overloading the channel network even in normal storms .	-5.9003
The problem is well known for the administration and initial measures have already been taken .	-2.9132
However , Häußler pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those on flood protection and must not be mixed .	-3.6120
The community is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be covered .	-3.5180
Greater dimension of sanitation would swallow millions .	-3.6593

However , there are different witness statements which should be evaluated first .	-3.1040
It is clear that the 19 years old steering from a VW golf towards Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came up with her hyundai .	-4.6951

On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies of children at schools .	-16.7700

The spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 percent , according to CDC between 1997 and 2007 .	-16.1411

Parents of intersexual children can choose “ Gender Undetermined ”	-2.2780
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognized for children born with non-clear genitals .	-2.6136
Newborn is no longer assigned to rigid male or female .	-2.6711
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare gender for such children , but can specify “ indefinitely ” or “ not determined ” on the birth document .	-13.6562
The law aims to put pressure on parents so that they do not have to make hasti decisions on operations for gender allocation in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-4.7462
An intersexual person said , according to BBC years later , “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.5923
I remain mutilated and scared by doctors .	-2.2432
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children every year comes neither as boys nor girls to the world .	-2.8426
They are among the intersexuals , a group falling under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a concept of collection for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( eggs or heats ) or unusually developed genitals .	-4.4538
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.4505
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise that we should use the best available information for gender assignment if a provision is not possible , rather than waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before , if anything , decide to to operate in .	-18.0328
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds after a good thing ” .	-2.9433
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.0383
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not , ” he said .	-3.1455
Gender assignments could be made without operation and then wait for the identity to develop .	-4.8435
The scientific data about how a child develops its gender identity is not very precise .	-2.6625
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.4538
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-0.9320
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexual people are to be distinguished from transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender , but because of their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-4.7641
These characteristics were shown in sexual sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or in chromosom structures and hormones .	-4.0373
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination facing intersexual and transgender persons in professional life , as well as the scale of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .	-15.7263
Not consistent boys have a special camp now .	-2.7864
In Australia and Nepal it is now possible for adults to indicate male or “ third gender ” on official documents .	-3.2747

In neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , such a news reporting on France 24 .	-2.9076
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition to remove the “ gender theory ” from schoolbooks .	-2.6547
The US Catholic Online website has also opposed German law , with the justification : “ If the world is distorted into a new state where gender is a decision , sexual activity is not , then we distort two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-5.1189
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth .	-3.5695
“ Parents are stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of their own child , ” she said to the parent website .	-4.4492
Children need stability and security .	-0.5774
Historically , children born with both male and female sexes were called Hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek god that had both sexes .	-2.6922
Ten years ago , medicine regarded the sex as something that could be erased and then rebuilt .	-3.5314
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being doubted , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they allocate .	-5.7695
“ In the mid-twentieth century , it was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-2.7924
If such a child was born , you called not the psychiatrist , but the surgeons .	-3.0664
The ruling theory on the treatment of children with unequivocal genitals dates back to Dr. John Money of the John Hopkins University , who believed that gender can be formed .	-4.2636
He characterized the term “ gender identity ” and argued , social and environmental impetus – as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , in such a way as to see a person as male or female .	-4.3396
But , in a case called “ John / Joan ” under the title of 1966 , his theories were controversial .	-3.4862
He granted the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated in the event of a crushed circumcision , to castray the child completely and remove his habits , and then to pull it as a girl .	-7.8557
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , but he did not , ” said Dresch, .	-15.8543
When the boy was about 15 , he changed back to the male sex and married a woman .	-2.2840
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-2.1188
According to the Rescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.8670
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the Internet , the survivors of these gender operations have come to the public that “ are not happy with the result . ”	-3.6242
For example , at Jim Bruce , a 36 year old author from Montana , who was born with XY male chromosomes , but two clear genitals .	-17.1425
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitory or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-3.3281
So his external organ and the Hoden were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was brought up as girls .	-5.0461
At the age of 12 , he received female hormones .	-1.9595
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he said to ABCNews.com	-12.5508
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.4399
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-1.9261
But since he was depressive and knew that something was not true , he demanded his medical files .	-3.1692
What he found out was shocking .	-0.6496
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one ever said so .	-2.9532
Bruce was born with a DSD that could not produce enough testosteron to develop the genital .	-3.3226
After learning the truth , he returned to male identity , received Testosteron injections , and his breasts could be removed .	-3.6733
The operation has made it infertile .	-2.2388
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for the perception of intersexual people as normal . the of the of and of the of the .	-15.7609
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of Advocates for Informed Choice based in California , worries that German law could “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.4560
“ Many activists are worried that the German decision might encourage parents to make rapid decisions and to adopt the child not to “ assign ” , she explained .	-4.8712
We fear that this favours intervention .	-2.4694
We think it would be better to assign male or female sex and then wait .	-2.1511
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-1.9438
Tamar-Mattis said that its organization supports Australian law , because “ it enables adults to recognize as a third gender . ”	-18.6354
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their sex , ” she explained .	-2.7830
German law concerns the assignment of birth .	-2.3551
This is not a battle to force small children at this stage .	-2.6354
If they are adult , they can choose their own body .	-2.9493
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a brustradiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that German law “ authorized ” both parents and children .	-3.4482
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete drug resistance .	-2.6364
Catie has developed female characteristics due to the recipe assignment of the Testosteron targets . the the of the of of and the of the of of .	-14.8203
She has a vagina , but not a uterus and no eggs .	-1.9766
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a child 's psychiatric staff in her and her in her . , she and her .	-20.5930
Although it is infertile , it hopes to have a child through adoption or a mother .	-3.8069
“ The law gives parents room , which does not have to make decisions overrun , ” said Baratz .	-3.6895
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them time to write “ male ” or “ female ” .	-3.0115
In this way everything is fine – one draws the child large and loves it .	-3.3790
You have a wonderful baby and you can enjoy parental happiness .	-3.1086
And you don 't have to make an operation hasty , which can no longer be reversed .	-4.7384
“ That includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they believe they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.3998
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that is better suited to him – and that is wonderful .	-3.4621
This will enable children to decide for themselves .	-2.1380
Unknown Violated Girls from Car Shot	-2.7861
Unknown for shots from a car injured a twelve years in Saxony-Anhalt .	-2.5017
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin .	-2.7376
That was what shared the police in Castle .	-3.5098
The girl was easily injured at the left wade .	-2.1592
Rescue forces brought the girl into hospital .	-1.7619

Since the house owners recognized this in good time and removed the egg rests immediately , no damage may have arisen .	-5.3506
Some Sylvesterböllers were also lightened in the urban area , but no damage has been caused .	-16.8571

Living with Future Prospective	-2.5636
Actually , Waltraud Ries lives dreamy .	-2.6148
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with plenty of green , ancient trees , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.8858
It is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-2.6681
" You hopefully have no fear of spinning ? " , Waltraud Ries asks and shows a great spider on the door .	-3.8639
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.0297
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.4199
However , the reason is not spinning phobia , but the concern that the many staircases to house and apartment can no longer be managed is explained .	-5.3276
Moreover , since a Meniskus operation , the midfifty people have to know about their own body , which means moving with handicap of floors to floors .	-5.4559
Recently , a book from her appeared on the topic of ' happiness live in age - What form is the best for me ? ' .	-4.8975
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at all ' starts telling them .	-3.5704
When they moved to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was just a nice apartment in the middle of the green .	-3.3744
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it .	-2.8082
She also knows that she is one of the few people who are dealing with ' housing at all ' .	-4.2639
Most people are forcing it as long as it goes .	-3.2451
Old are always the other , " she says smiling .	-3.3837
Only when suffering pressure is really large will we think .	-3.8944
'Then it can be too late ' , so Ries .	-3.7173
In her book , the interior architect presents 17 models for self-determined living in the age .	-3.8968
" Which form you choose is always an individual decision , " explains it .	-2.3152
D i e Solution there is not for age .	-2.7230
Even if you can afford the age residence in Tuscany or Brittany , you should always consider that he could also become sick .	-3.8412
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the language , you can join in the Dolce Vita , ' gives the author the willingness to escape .	-5.8986
Among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of living or often cited pensioner WG .	-3.7174
At the age of everyone has its ticks and fakes	-4.2424
" For me , a community of housing would be nothing " , she says with an eyewinker .	-5.1822
Not even in a student WG with a shared bathroom and a kitchen .	-2.6288
'At age you just need your retreat rooms ' , so Ries .	-3.3269
Nevertheless , the bookauthor does not want to rule out the senior housing community .	-3.6655
That would have to be different from that in the classic student WG .	-3.7247
And sometimes you just want your calm ' , she believes .	-3.8072
In this opinion , it is not alone in the country ’ , at least , capit.	-14.4322
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for so long , " is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of citizens ' service life at the age of the capital .	-4.6505
Your service advises people around the subject of ' older become ' .	-3.8250
Therefore , precisely elderly people would often accept inconveniences and restrictions , only to be able to stay in their customary environment , and that is also the experience of the Foundation Warentest .	-14.7811
Today there are many ways of making the house or the apartment accessible .	-3.7929
Ries recommends to all those who deal with the old-fair rebuilding of their house or their apartment to inform themselves thoroughly once and not to commission the best craftsmen .	-6.4787
Today we also have specialists for old conversion .	-3.9732
Even in the rental apartment it is possible to realize one or the other , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architect clarifies .	-5.2299
But the existing apartment is not always equipped with old-fashioned and thus barrier-free , even if it is still so beautiful .	-5.8294
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-2.1819
Although you could install a staircase lift within the apartment , the path paved with staircases until the housing door would be much bigger .	-5.5839
She will continue until she found the ideal object for her and her husband .	-2.9859
Before moving it , it grey more than before the spider at their door .	-17.1052
US wants to continue prosecuting Snowden	-2.7030
The US has not changed its attitude to former US intelligence worker Edward Snowden .	-2.4248
He is still accused of having given unauthorised secret information .	-3.3085
He therefore had to face criminal proceedings in the US , said the spokesman of the US Department of Foreign Affairs , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-3.6503
Snowden 's recent statements would not change this either .	-2.8415
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US not to continue to threaten him with punishment .	-13.9962
Psaki stressed that the statements made by a parliamentarian are that of a German member of state .	-5.1087
Intelligence service hull Edward Snowden is willing to discuss with German authorities .	-3.5418
However , first he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.2979
This has clarified the former NSA employees sought by the US in an unaddressed letter published by Green politicians Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to federal government , federal day , and general prosecutor .	-4.2004
The letter follows the following text , following a translation spread by sterling :	-5.0893
The competents	-2.1795
I have been asked to write you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance .	-2.4022
I was called Edward Joseph Snowden and formerly employed a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-10.5790
During my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic infringements of my government , which caused me moral duty to act .	-3.7802
As a result of publishing these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and lasting heat that forced me to leave my family and my home country .	-3.9988
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.9791
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.0090
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged revelations on a system of all-embracing surveillance , which nobody is accountable as a service to the public .	-17.9629
These spy revelations submitted many proposals on new laws and guidelines aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence .	-4.0560
The benefits for society from these findings are increasingly clearer , while the risks that have been purchased have clearly been reduced .	-4.0204
Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven positive , my government , Dissense , continues to treat Dissense as a faithful break and seek to criminalise and accuse political expression .	-5.6522
However , the truth is not crime .	-12.7688
I am confident that the Government of the United States , with the support of the international community , will take this detrimental stance .	-3.6771
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate properly and legally in relation to the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-4.5602
I look forward to a discussion with you in your country when the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that we all protect .	-3.9186

Report : Obama campaign considered replacing Bids with Hillary Clinton	-1.5213
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton , the New York Times .	-2.7104
The unveiling is the most noteworthy surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-3.3575
The Times is a copy of the next book , and she reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top counsel would have carried out “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether it would be better for Obama ’ s dwindling hope for re-election if he falls bid .	-6.6860
According to Jonathan Martin , the national correspondent of the Times , the book is thoroughly following the history of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the White House , especially the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure what effect it has on the surveys to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President .	-4.8713
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret in the Chicago campaign infrastructure and the Oval Office .	-2.8044
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , the former Obama campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former leading White House , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the reasoned change .	-4.3311
In Double Down , Daley claims that Daley was leading the effort to exchange Biden , despite its “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before deciding against such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would not significantly improve Obama ’ s opportunities . ”	-14.2850
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.0944
“ I said a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley declared the magazine .	-3.1310
It must be remembered that the President had terrible surveys at the time , so we thought , “ To God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-3.7505
While Daley described the “ necessary care ” investigations , Martin said to Anderson Cooper from CNN that during the campaign for re-election , a significant effort was made to find out whether such a train would pay off with regard to the ballot box .	-5.6453
“ In campaigns , there is not so much money spent on surveys and focus groups if you do not seriously think about something , ” Martin declared AC360 .	-3.6398
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange .	-1.7089
Martin said to CNN , he asked Daley if his boss had known about the potential change .	-2.7441
Although Daley explained that he does not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it .	-4.1651
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political soldiers had reached a desk .	-3.4305
Cooper asked Martin whether he thinked seriously that Obama did not know whether to let bids fall during the elections .	-3.7547
“ Possibility ” , Martin replied .	-1.8451
What will happen to my email ?	-2.3840
E-mail actually means electronic letter .	-1.9309
When designing the Internet service e-mail , was the conventional mail technically implemented letter secrecy ?	-4.4870
The concept of early Internet services was focused on making communication possible .	-3.0813
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been taken care of creating a stable foundation for a safe change of letters .	-4.1923
Therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter .	-2.5290
If user " Anna " to " Benni " sends a mail , are the machines of the two directly connected ?	-2.7460
The e-mail program or the browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .	-3.3128
For example , if you have a GMail account , the Google would be .	-1.9448
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni .	-1.8354
On the route you can run the mail via several other servers on the Internet .	-3.0165
Bennie can then call the content from his provider .	-2.7142

The sender provider usually checks whether the mail leads a mail program as an attachment .	-4.6478
A virus check is also made on the receiver systems .	-1.8092
Moreover , the providers check whether it is a burdensome and unwanted spam mail that is deleted the same or at least disposed of in a spam folder .	-4.8081
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.7584
In systems like GMail , the robot also identifies the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.5973
If Anna and Benni communicate via their upcoming holiday tours by Gmail , Google can display links to holiday offers .	-4.3671
Read unknown people with emails ?	-2.8396
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail is very small .	-3.3855
Theoretically , however , this is possible in the.	-4.0281
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to collect electronic mail .	-2.7637
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to catch or notify e-mails .	-3.7798
There are possible illegal storage actions .	-4.1091
Is it possible to protect emails against the medium ?	-1.8697
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against notes .	-3.3255
With a high technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadata of e-mail communication so that it is not even easy to recognize who communicated with whom .	-4.4865

Mother in the Forest Displays and Pensions Cashe. the the and the the the the the the . the the	-13.6982
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-1.7161
He caught the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pensions and care money .	-3.8470
In order to be able to collect further pensions and care money , a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after the police investigations in the forest .	-3.8983
First , he covered the death of the 89-year-olds , then he rectified the money for more than a half years .	-3.7009
Now , as a spokesman on Friday said , the 67-year-old is responsible for fraud .	-3.6534
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.3607
The man was suspected as early as May : at that time , there was no longer any need for medicines for the careful mother .	-5.1715
The investigators told the pensioner that his mother travelled to Spain .	-2.2374
Because the officials found this strange , they continued to determine .	-3.2233
It was found that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had last maintained it .	-4.5816
The 67 year-old finally granted the death of his mother .	-2.9500
According to the police , an obduction did not provide evidence of capital crime .	-3.4055
Looking for ice cream lighting in the dark ?	-3.5250
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the darkness – with tortures .	-4.1394
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animals and created a bright delicacy .	-3.2229
The idea came to him after he had read a research into pains and convinced Chinese scientists to make the bright protein artificially .	-4.7210
The ice cream reacts in consumption with the tongue , increasing the pH value in the protein and triggering the light .	-4.1685
Chris explains that dining reacts to the warmth in the mouth and light – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-4.4181
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious , ” says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so it gets two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.6633
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.3674
When the mouth heats the protein , the pH value and the ice light increases . the the the of the mout.	-16.1451
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal for us to bring it to Halloween because it has this wonderful lighting effect .	-3.6776
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced , because the torque light is four times more expensive than gold .	-2.8218
Each ball will cost me about 140 pounds .	-14.7324
But this is tasty .	-2.5037
Charlie ’ s experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef , and sheet gold .	-3.6097
But its latest creation is to be even more ambitious .	-1.9910
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.3741
That is impossible in itself because of the light break caused by the ice crystals from which ice cream consists of ; but I suspect we find a way to create it .	-21.3805
The ice-cream takes advantage of the fluorescent properties of a torture made artificially by Chinese scientists .	-3.0997
After six days of play , TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association Liga .	-3.0709
Now it is excellent for the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow to oppose the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.6635
With this game the season starts for us .	-3.0338
" I hope that we finally have the head free " , gives Ehlers behavior optimistic .	-2.8442
He finally has his complete cadre , except for the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme .	-4.3664
Like us , Daverden also relies on tempo games .	-3.9592
That is why we must keep our error rate low .	-2.4420
First of all , however , we need to increase the cover , which has left anything but a safe impression .	-4.0746
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first season victory against North Horn .	-15.4390
The game was , of course , a house number .	-1.7879
But for that reason we are not favorite yet , because everything can always happen in Derby .	-3.6357
Nevertheless , Panitz now wants to launch a series in Morsum .	-3.5700
Jan-Malte is missing .	-19.2849
To this end , the A-Youth Joost Windsuss , who is active in the HC Bremen season debut with double gaming law , is celebra .	-18.3812
Anyone who is not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.7718
Halloween 2013 : In numbers	-0.9991
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.3531
My sister and I was allowed to eat sweetness late , stay late and dress us for neighbourhood .	-2.7567
Today I became a Halloween buffel .	-2.6375
Over the last two years I have not agreed to distribute sweetness from my apartment , and probably this year will not .	-4.1190
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep about Halloween .	-1.9991
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending $ 6.9 billion on sweetness , costumes , and decorations , such as the US Association of Retailers ( NGF ) .	-3.5208
One thing I am looking forward to each Halloween again is the trend values .	-3.4749
The costumes will account for about $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , the NGF .	-2.7837
This year are charming unlived items of the last cry .	-3.0519
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothing , they can now embody tempting food such as pizza , hamburger or carot .	-4.3691
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space men will create it this year in the installation feeds .	-3.7222
According to Google , the most sought costumes are Zombies , Batman , Pirates and Hexen .	-3.0280
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.7525
We dressed our dogs last year and I was surprised not alone .	-4.1968
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on pets ’ costumes , said NGF .	-2.2763
These are a lot “ hot dogs ” .	-2.1308
As far as sweetness is concerned , we are not sh.	-3.1401
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , said The Nielsen Company .	-1.2751
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolates , slides , bonbons and rubber bears .	-2.7544
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Department of Commerce , who draw the quarter with the “ sweetness or saures . ”	-4.1831
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and , let us not imagine , eat .	-3.2877
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms are sold around Halloween , the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers .	-3.4740
These are about nine billion grains of maize .	-2.2052
It is a puzzle that I could not solve yet .	-2.1947
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses in which it spoke .	-3.1504
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is in fact a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.5102
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognized spuk houses in the United States , which achieve $ 500 million in revenue , America skin , and that includes the wonderful photos on which one pinkels into the trousers and then put the friends on Facebook where you will not get rid of them again , and a type to which one stands leaving a comment like “ nice facial expression ” .	-8.1672
But we finally come to the cuts .	-2.1526
Charlie Brown familiarised us with the big bureau when we were children , and cutting a pumpkin is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something that we made from small ones .	-4.6097
Fortunately , only last year , thanks to Pinterest , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend has begun , so most of us have grown up to sit down the cuts and not sit in it .	-5.4477
This year , Americans will spend roughly $ 106 million on cuts , the US Census Bureau .	-2.1215
The pumpkin slowly rotted in the pre-garden probably comes from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms were harvested this year .	-3.4362
If you wish to point correctly , call Tintin and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut a little chicken from their 921 kilo heavy cuts .	-28.2031
Housing fire in Helmbrechts : rescue forces mount coaled bodies	-3.4708
The fire fighter had to express in Helmbrechts late Thursday evening .	-3.1664
A three-family house in the countryside courtyard begins fire at night to Friday .	-3.5035
The rescue forces bear a cold body from the house .	-14.4120
Salvation forces have found a coal body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrecht .	-4.1143
Whether it is an inhabitant still unclear , as a spokesman of the police in Bayreuth said .	-3.1694
Late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.4608
When the fire arrived , the flames beat a window .	-2.9501
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.3113
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-3.9391

All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police spokesperson continued to decl. the the was , , , and the the the the of the .	-17.9247
The building is no longer habitable at the moment .	-2.7980
The precise cause of the fire was not clear initially .	-2.2798
Germany ’ s largest country church has launched an offensive to promote the Pastor ’ s profession .	-2.8686
The background is a possible shortage of parish : the Gospel Lutheric Church Hannover expects the number of its current 1,800 pastors to be halved by 2030 .	-5.2057
For young people today the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the gospel press service .	-3.6145
It is attractive to determine the working and day-to-day procedure itself .	-3.6676
With Burfien , the Church for the first time ordered a pastor in a full place to inspire young people for theology studies .	-5.0167
At present , less and less young people choose to study theology .	-2.7123
Burfien returns this to the process of dekirching : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.5635
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.4109
I am a gentleman and I can give my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.2932
Pastors could be close to man as a sailor .	-3.5620
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well of it .	-2.2430
To be sure , the free economy would pay more , but for that , theologists would have a safe employer .	-3.2596
This is contrary to the young people of today , who are not just talking about careers , but about working meaningfully .	-4.2458
According to the National Church , which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are currently in retirement each year .	-3.8276
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariat .	-2.7645
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Hart , the Emsland or the Wendland , it is difficult to fill jobs in the future .	-4.5785
Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-3.9564
The theology studies offer a broad education .	-3.1504
One can even become Federal President .	-3.1350
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.5734
In the interior you will find race seats and six-point belts as well as a speech facility .	-4.2867
The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with maintenance of bowler-works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-3.6134
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , says : “ The Rally Customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.9260
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people looking for voltage and adventure as well as a way to global class events .	-24.3487
We are pleased to be able to open this path to partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare new ones for the straps and reality of Rally Raid .	-4.9764
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be a entertaining championship .	-2.6322
There is also a training and testing day in February and the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.2552
Called fire fighting to save a hint , 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock protrude in a stone break .	-17.1019
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was running out after a smaller road accident .	-3.4923
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in a stone break in her midistress.	-17.0413
Fire fighters disappeared on rock wall and saved the dog from safe death .	-4.0168
The fire fighter succeeded in safeguarding a sink that was fixed on a 15-metre high lead in a rock wall .	-6.5353
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby went out after a traffic accident at the Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was saved on Wednesday from a stbr.	-5.6692
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his friend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the stone break of Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.5232
They had desperately looked for their missing handine and published calls for help in social networks when she was in the stone collapse after the small traffic accident .	-5.1653
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker saw his dog , the broken Ruby on the 15 meters high paragraph in the stone break .	-5.1877
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to rescue Ruby , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-4.2896
Andy Clayton , a technical rescue team specialist , said : “ It was in a dangerous situation .	-2.1936
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from above and the ground .	-2.8035
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was stiff-frozen .	-3.0322
But now it goes well .	-2.9785
She then eaten some dog cakes .	-3.1027
That was a rather unusual commitment .	-1.6346
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.1049
Peter Lau , a technical rescue team specialist , said : “ Ruby had a huge happiness . ”	-2.5593
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.5787
Ruby was brought to a veterinary study , but nothing found out of exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.2380
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ Watching the rescue was frightening . ”	-2.8157
I could not even think she was there .	-3.0250
It was wonderful to keep them in the poor .	-17.1702
The veterinary explained if the exhaustion became too large and collapsed , it would probably be overthrown .	-3.3651
The fire fighters have done great things .	-2.2264
It was really brave what they did .	-1.8286
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.0601
Scott Alderson added from Keighley : “ We had fear that she would fall down , but she stayed above . ”	-3.1172
The fire fighters were great .	-1.3965
I can hardly believe where she was .	-1.6232
Mick Jagger explained that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-13.9310
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she was working as a background singer to Jaggers ’ song “ Old Habits The Hard ” from 2004 .	-3.5811
Perry explained she had eaten the Aldry in the evening , and that “ he took me when I was 18 . ”	-4.0817
She added , “ That is long ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-12.5976
In a declaration , a representative , Yagger , 70 , on Thursday , said that he “ categorically denied that he ever made approach attempts at Katy Perry . ”	-3.7489

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives Scots the election	-12.1622
A new day , a new history of terror to independence .	-1.7474
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-1.9265
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the hadrian wall .	-3.3091
Indeed , the Strathclyde proposal referred to the potential economic benefits that would bring greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but this – expected – played no role in the headlines .	-4.8184
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often comply with their strict rules if it is more favourable .	-3.6403
Since Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area , the continued disregard for Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what one really wants from the Scots .	-3.9221
So no story .	-2.1363
And one that has come so long ago that she already likes a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” enter at least 40 years ago .	-5.0682
An interesting point is being lost in the constant repeat of this ancient story .	-3.3528
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance it after the European pipe ?	-2.1976
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels , especially now ?	-2.3787
These are the real news : the great plan to unify Europe after the war has stalled .	-3.7107
The euro crisis has officially died the European project .	-2.5051
Parties across the EU are gaining ground that are anti-EU or want to throw the euro aboard the Community currency .	-3.6127
Even in Germany , the Eurosceptic Party could spread alternative to Germany – only this year – almost five million votes in the federal election in September , thereby effectively distributing Free Democrats ( equivalent to British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-4.1608
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.5016
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.4398
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the national economy is needed by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-19.0636
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-1.9556
Instead , the euro system has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that way .	-3.4638
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will again have a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-3.5790
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.1523
Behind the current budgetary and currency problems , there is a deeper European productivity problem .	-15.4729
As a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines ordered by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and gas compared to the United States .	-3.2030
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.3034
All world wage descriptions do not protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-2.7812
As a result , a revolt draws up , especially in France , the former EU Cheer Leader .	-3.1699
Following the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.5174
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has pushed Europe 's own economic policy , which has to fight the French economy that has been hit .	-5.7111
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU front , National , has just won a crucial election and three referred to the governing socialists .	-4.3025
The National Front is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-3.6113
What does Le Pen do with their new popularity among the white French working class ?	-2.2696
It would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.8431
If the anti-EU parties perfectly cut off in these elections – and this is perfectly possible – then , for the first time , such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.2533
This is the point I would like to add : in the not-too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will meet to eliminate the euro .	-3.7766
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations that favored General de Gaulle .	-12.9072
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.3183
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the US .	-3.1048
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific area suggests that Britain alone will be in the Atlantic rain .	-2.3421
Where is Scotland left with all this ?	-2.2165
We can decide to be a region of ( last consequence ) small England .	-2.6039
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can infect where they can affect .	-3.0853
I suspect Scotland could go quite well in a looser European union if we retain our own currency .	-4.2603
Cooperation with other countries similarly thinking is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.1670
Otherwise , we should consider doing Norway equal and maintaining our economic independence .	-2.5526
The SNP administration in Scotland is , remarkably , the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and has won a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and performed ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition .	-4.3620
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only to impose austerity on Berlin and Brussels .	-2.6473

Should a mother be worried when her daughter grows at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and shamhair ?	-3.8171
At the annual conference of the Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , Pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-3.4662
“ I spend a lot of time calming parents – normally this is not an indication that now comes quickly to puberty , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-4.5273
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hair , as well as body smell , are previously shown in girls .	-4.9501
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menary ( appearance of the first regulatory blood ) over the last 40 years .	-4.5017
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , a little less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.0771
“ When the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the Menarch , ” said Kaplowitz , also the author of the book “ Early Puberty in girls : the essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-4.3875
Time is the most precise test of how puberty progresses .	-2.3362
It is controversial , which is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early ” if breast enlargement is accompanied by a boost of growth before an age of eight .	-3.9480
In most cases , the process slows down or stagnates – something that a paediatrician can carefully monitor .	-3.3750
With faster advances , tests could be displayed by an endicronologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or systems .	-3.9978
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and defending another consequence : premature ageing of bones , which can ultimately lead to growth reduction and , hence , small body growth in adults .	-4.9297
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and emotional maturity .	-3.8386
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-0.8468
Kaplowitz is restrained in medicines , but he acknowledges : “ Oppressing puberty can alleviate behavior problems and feelings of girls unlike their age counterparts . ” the the that is .	-20.0783
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.7679
“ They worry about the pregnancy risk or how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-2.2060
“ It was a shock , ” remembers a woman whose daughter received ten days .	-2.9103

Young people like girls come into puberty earlier .	-3.0485
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.2693
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years , establishing a link between body fat and entry into puberty .	-3.9046
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.0050
In this country , African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age counterparts .	-3.2369
There are different explanations for this .	-1.5106
Global seems to be an early puberty of all possible things , from economic conditions to the climate to the genes .	-2.9663
Another puzzle : although boys are growing facial and shameful hair earlier , the trend to full previous puberty is not as pronounced as girls .	-4.2007
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-1.9105
The emergence of acne and shamhaar is spread even at babies and young children .	-3.0899
“ We need to be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-15.7971

Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat width in the face of large orders	-14.4889
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a discussion about the width of seats in the tourist class at long-distance flights , which indicates the tone for a bitter clash on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-5.5727
The dispute revolves around the width offered by passengers on long flights in the class of tourists – not always those who are trying to make the most of airlines , but this explained space is the key to the efficiency assertions of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-22.4176
Airbus called for an industry standard this week , which requires a width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the class of tourists , but the US Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide to do to this .	-19.5905
At a time when the aircraft builders compete to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-distance flights , and expect record orders from November 17th to 21st .	-4.3048
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the specified economic outcomes that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design will provide .	-4.8245
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 77X ” receives 406 people at tourist class seats , which are wide over 17 inches and allow 10 per series .	-5.8959
Airbus declares that the competitive version of the A350 transports 350 persons in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per series of seatcompancompared in the A3. the of and the Airbuthe the A3the A3of the Airbuthe of the A35.	-25.9517
Aircraft giants often share love of technical details using advertising in the technical press .	-3.3508
Now Airbus is appealing in front of the Dubai Airshow , where 777X with more than 100 orders will probably make the race directly to the public .	-3.4416
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept it ? ”	-5.5306
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-props , ” says Airbus sales chief John Leahy .	-2.4769
Given changes in food habits , people become thicker , but aircraft seats have not chanso radic.	-4.6125
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance travel , and at the end of the century the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years has increased by ten percent , the US Department of Health data .	-3.8234
The scope of the male average American in the 21st century , according to US health statistics , is 100.8 cm .	-25.5188
Airbus says that his rival is a concept of seating from the 1950s , when the average body range of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-4.1675
One , Airbus , carried out investigations showing that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases sleep quality by 53 % .	-3.9217
Boeing disputes the numbers of Airbus on seats and says that it is not discreet for manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between tariffs and equipment .	-4.2841
The company also explains , according to studies , that aircraft experience depends on more than the width of the seat .	-3.5380
“ It really comes to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains Boeing ’ s aircraft expert Kent Craver .	-4.1745
They do not want us to dictate what makes them profitable .	-1.8037
They know their business better than anyone else .	-10.5881
For passengers , freedom of elbow is at stake , but for manufacturers it becomes increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-4.2064
Behind the dispute is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices over the coming decades , which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-20.6436
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the discussion about the new jets .	-2.7738
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-distance designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.3861
The statements Boeings on the results depend partly on the 777X being compared to the original design of nine seats in 777 .	-4.0068
Increased costs per unit are still lower than the currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-3.0567
“ Boeing therefore quetches more seats into its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at the European Airbus .	-19.4341
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per series of existing 777s indicated that many passengers decided to closer arrangement , which might be accompanied by cheaper tariffs .	-4.0188
“ Eighteen customs seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled from the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin establishment , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.0646
Airbus and Boeing offer not seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-2.3603
World jet sellers even carry bandmass to measure the institution at competition .	-4.1984
Even if they are comfortable , all manufacturers also offer jets with high-compression design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.5670
Airbus offers a 10-seat A350 , but , according to its own statement , has not yet selled .	-16.0724
Until recently , Airbus emphasised the importance of adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats in the courses for some jets .	-3.7183
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard would probably be scattered , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.1562
New Anti-Nicotin vaccine could make the Garden of Smoking	-3.0660
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking .	-2.3555
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for life from nicotine search .	-3.1432
Further tests are needed before human beings , which may take a few years ago , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Will Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-4.0135
“ We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and tried all the methods available on the market , but they had to experience that their nicotine is stronger than those approaches , ” says Cornell .	-4.3632
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed in such a way that it contains genetic information to produce nicotine antibodies .	-3.0622
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent electricity of antibodies .	-2.3721
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , making a smoker no nicotine high .	-3.2381
In attempts , vaccinated mice administered by Nikotin maintained its normal level of activity .	-3.4531
However , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ time out , ” said researchers , a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain .	-4.2951
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine Fachblatt .	-2.2427
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.4625
The vaccination had to be given so often to maintain the anti-body level that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.0937
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it turns liver cells into anti-body factories .	-2.6222
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine search .	-23.3266
But , more likely , smokers would use it to stop .	-1.2846
“ You know , when they start smoking again , they no longer feel pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and this helps them to place the habit , ” he explains .	-4.9458
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.2553
Tripodi was disputed to have been influenced by Oberd	-15.2116
The former Labor-Party Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales has opened an investigation by the government ’ s corruption supervision .	-4.6487
The former NSW minister denies that the rules on maritime contempt have changed on request from his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had hidden participation in three parties in government-controlled country .	-5.6025
The Independent Commission Againt Corruption ( ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations on Friday to ask whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend pachting contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without calling for them to be extended in August 2005 .	-18.5803
Now , because of the accusation , Tripodi knew about the interest of Obeid ’ s covert land , after Tripodi ’ s former Deputy Chief of Staff Lynne Ashpole had pronounced accordingly on Thursday .	-5.4053
In many years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tendering for the Pacht Treaties .	-3.5879
The powers were opposed to it , and they also wanted longer running times . to to to to to to the and to to to .	-18.3931
In 2009 , the fixed contracts for companies at the Circular Quay , which introduced the OBIDS $ 2.5 million annually , were extended without public tendering .	-4.6927
Tripodi , who was the harbour minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally called for public tenders .	-3.3861
But he disputes having made the changes to Obeid ’ s request , which , as Tripodi confirmed , urged a reorganisation of government package rules .	-6.0877
One of the ICAC telephone reports showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who was changed to the port ministry after working under oild in the fishing authority .	-4.8106
“ Was the topic discussed in these phone talks the drafting of commercial contempt rules ? ” , Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-16.0023
‘ No ’ , Tripodi replied .	-1.6773
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-1.6410
Certainly not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.5090
Israeli combat aircraft attacking Syria ’ s Official Sources	-3.1176
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a goal in the Syrian port of Latakia , confirming a senior government official to Fox News .	-3.5692
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .	-2.1996
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.9065

Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to “ real-life ” tests	-2.5886
The government is considering a 457 visa for foreign workers within the framework of enlarged actions on a “ “ re“ te” “ ” “ ” ” “ ” ” ” “ ”	-14.3212
If the test were introduced , it would be used via a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the train from family and friends to Australia .	-3.6621
Today , a proposal for discussion by the government was published after the former members of the Labor Party , Maxine McKew , had condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be viewed as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbours .	-5.0322
“ Strong declarations like foreigners should stop “ and , Australians first , ” are a very unpleasant retreat in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she told Australia India Institute today .	-5.5026
Historically , that meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region took a recho of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-3.8551
The proposal for a debate contains twelve measures , once considered by former Minister for Immigration , Chris Bowen .	-3.3194
Immigration Secretary Brendan O 'Connor , who went to talks yesterday about smuggling in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and others are still considered .	-11.7296
If the “ reality criterion ” is adopted , someone who applies for a visa could be checked whether “ the application is real in cases where the applicant is relatively or personally associated with the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-5.2924
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , hundreds of companies that first wanted to support a small number of workers have finally stopped .	-4.1839
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri-Lankan asylum died at a heart rate after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island .	-3.6029
The disturbed nine-year son of the man who came to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin on Wednesday , who was also on the boat since his father 's death .	-4.3183
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .	-1.5581
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.3692
In the work of HS2 Ltd , it is proposed to implement high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England at the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .	-27.2494
Transport Secretary Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.1873
Scottish Transport Secretary Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.7262
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway connection between London and the West Midlands .	-20.8336
After finishing phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.1338
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds .	-2.2015
The British Government , which is in discussions with Transport Scotland , has asked HS2 Ltd to look for further distance capacities and improvements in travel time for North England and Scotland .	-4.1949
This includes the possibility of travelling from three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.0837
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.2242
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-1.9296
Without it , we face a capacity crisis in our railway network .	-2.4869
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.8475
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-1.7609
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” to be involved in the HS2 network .	-3.0980
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail connection provides the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time Scotland ’ s economic power provides an argument for rapid train connections across the UK . ”	-13.9397
That is why we are pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to investigate the options for high-speed rail links in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the link between Glasgow-Edinburgh , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-4.5277
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and together deciding the next steps .	-3.3530
Regulations on electronic aircraft remain in force in Australia .	-2.7201
Australian passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at start and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease the regulations for such devices .	-3.5985
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their targets so that passengers can read , see or play videos during critical flight stages , if they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.5444
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books at the start and landing .	-4.5035
Australian societies are watching the decision to implement which American airlines have to do vast amounts of work , but do not pursue immediate plans to change their rules .	-4.4748
The CASA Aviation Safety Authority also declared that it would look at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply in critical aircraft phases in Australia .	-4.6709
“ CASA currently has no specific rules regarding the use of electronic aircraft , ” has been explained .	-3.6972
The issue is subject to provisions that airlines must maintain safety at any time and follow passengers ' security instructions given by cabin staff .	-4.9482
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and explaining that one is open to change , but these should be initiated by the legislator .	-4.3876
“ We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic equipment by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-3.9028
Qantas explained that it would remain with the current rules until further .	-18.9346
“ Our current directives indicate that electronic equipment should not be used when starting and landing , and we currently have no plans to change it , ” the company explained .	-4.1070
The FAA regulations apply to US airlines .	-1.7255
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that enable passengers to benefit , and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-15.9407
Depending on the age of the fleet , the decision has different effects on American societies in different .	-20.8210
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders by mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer referral .	-3.5548
“ After an airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , easy to use electronic equipment such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-4.2847
In rare cases in bad terms , the crew will tell the passengers while landing off the devices .	-4.3019
The group also recommended to stow heavier devices on start and landing securely under the seat or in the subjects above the seats .	-4.1699
Before the reviewerby against the switch , the most popular BVB trailer with light tracks had provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-5.7949
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences .	-1.6666
Before the Friday game of the Football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras reacted with a silence - first .	-3.4203
It was an unusual acoustic , almost sponsored , that offered the viewer until just before the start of the federal game between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park .	-5.0834
Most of the guest fans were singing in .	-5.4346
The South Tribune opposed the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans , initially presented themselves extraordinarily quiet : no singing , no battlefiel.	-19.0480
The podest of the capo , which otherwise coordinates the shared firing , remained unoccupied .	-3.1565
And above all in the gallery , a large flag born with the label " Stadium Ban " .	-5.4105
Only when Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player , branded short-term jubles .	-4.0776
When his team colleagues followed , there was loudly vocals and floating slopes - but not everywhere .	-3.7791
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Tribune .	-2.8008
Even that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel listed once again the positive experiences of recent days - Derbyvictory , victory over Arsenal , extension of the contract of Trainer Jürgen Klopp , did not provide holiday leaves .	-4.3427
Only five minutes before the attack , the Capo closed its podium - and the tension until then with hands tangible was in a loud shrine , as usual the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-7.0961
Last but not least , the southern gallery was the turn - and finally it was here again as usual the loudest place in the stadium .	-5.2360
And , at the latest , as with the appearance of the southern gallery , the loudly invitation " Derbywinner stands on " came up , everything was like ever .	-6.5125
Silence before it was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-2.8748
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the most inclusive BVB trailers in light tracks were fired into the spectator ceilings and in the square - almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller met .	-7.0791
The game was late attacked because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.7818
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tips of the village munder Ultras in his office - and believed Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable date for fan representatives .	-4.7834
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement " , the BVB boss announced on a panel discussion in Frankfurt on Thursday evening .	-2.9246
As an immediate measure , Watzke banned the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-2.6536
" I have forbidden this , " he said .	-2.5489
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnology .	-1.9541
In addition , the ultras have shown different ways of penalising - until Tuesday , this time has come to decide for one .	-4.7234
Otherwise , Watzke , the BVB will set a sanction until the end of next week .	-2.3478
" This is cutting " , insured watzk .	-3.2617
We can be aware of how the reactions in the South Tribune will then be .	-4.6408

Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( approximately EUR 1,730 ) as an administrative worker and her husband also works , the monthly family income is not sufficient , she explains .	-4.2639
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is so large that ValueMax , where she has made her exchange , became the third house listed on the Singaporean Stock Exchange this week .	-4.1991
The plaguing of jewelry is not only a fast way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an uncertain bank loan .	-4.0037
Typically , houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 % , which is just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-3.6292
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that no review of credit ratings or income proof is needed here , which is why loans are faster than banks .	-5.0449
That is why millions of people in the region turn to pfandhouses after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing budgetary and consumer debt .	-3.9146
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to loose financial policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income houses are seeking houses to compensate for the difference in dead economies .	-4.8515
This week , the credit rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing fiscal debt , mainly by rising mortgages , was a risk factor for Asian banks ’ credit-worthiness .	-3.3250
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the Agency , have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-2.9377
Malaysia , with 80 % of GDP , is the top of the list , rising 60 % in 2008 .	-3.1778
Economists are also worrying because of the high levels of consumer indebtedness in Thailand , which emerged just this week from a technical recession .	-3.6904
On Thursday , the data showed a continued export weakness and a discount on consumer demand .	-2.8384

Rescue package of more than $ 325 million in Tasmanic Health Services	-2.6137
The Australian Government is insisting on the hard conditions linked to the rescue package of more than $ 325 million for Tasman health care to ensure that the federal state government cannot waste monthe .	-17.0899
Federal Minister for Health , Tanya Plibersek , has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.5704
Funding for a period of four years after government consultations with independent Tasman MEP Andrew Wilkie was decided .	-2.9167
“ The government has created an emergency rescue package that , in our opinion , faces the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” Pliberseck today declared .	-4.0023
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for electoral services .	-2.6993
Other 2600 operations , including orthopaedic intervention and treatments for grey star , are intended to remove residues .	-4.0711
In addition , there are money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better supply for stationary stays , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-4.2214
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected my clinic staff said that they were the best way to improve the tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-3.9579
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman Government .	-2.4977
The Federal State must maintain the current level of funding to get money from the Commonwealth , and monthly report on where the additional money was spent .	-4.2210
A three-minded Commission will be set up and will ensure that the Federal State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.2753
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would only benefit very little if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasman health system to a more sustainable course . ”	-4.1694
Nevertheless , he praised the government for having responded to his request for urgent aid , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.4411
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” said Wilkie .	-3.5214
According to the government of the state , these electoral services will largely compete with the recent cuts .	-2.9702

Syria has destroyed important facilities to manufacture chemical weapons and guitar gas munition , declared the global surveillance group for chemical weapons on Thursday , while in the north of the country there were severe clashes near one of the locations where presumably toxic substances are stored .	-5.1486
On Thursday , too , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed soon three years ago since the civil war began in , .	-23.5845
The announcement of the Organization for the Ban on Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date of deadline .	-2.6750
1 November , the Damascus organization based in The Hague to destroy all facilities to manufacture chemical weapons or to make “ inoperable , ” including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling of ammunition .	-4.4238
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.5447
Destroying the institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.1682
But then it is necessary to start destroying existing weapons and stocks .	-3.5928
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senfgas and nervous gas sarin .	-3.1595
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira took place on Thursday , experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites , as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said in the United Kingdom in in the .	-22.6511

The struggles underline the danger posed by the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a profound civil war .	-3.9100
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , “ the team now convinces that it has seen and experienced its destruction all the important production and filling facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-4.1040
That is why “ no more inspection activities are currently being planned . ”	-2.3327
Earlier this week , the inspectors declared that they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 of the sites specified by Damascus .	-3.1825
Because of safety concerns , the inspectors were unable to visit two institutions .	-3.1472
On Thursday , OPWC declared that both locations were “ abandoned ” according to Syrian statement ... and the chemical weapons programme objects existed there were shifted to other institutions inspected . ”	-4.4737
It was not immediately clear whether the site was one of the two facilities that could not visit the OPCW inspectors .	-2.5876
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which next month must be approved by the OPWC ’ s Executive Committee .	-3.0707

Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who killed the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angry at the judgment of the last of the incidents who had been brought to justice since Umar Patek , in their view , should be shot down on state law .	-6.5952
Patek , who was on the flight for almost ten years as one of the most sought people in Southeast Asia , was sentenced yesterday for his role in building explosive bodies to a prison sentence of 20 years .	-5.7584

The decision waken painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth , who lost their 39 years old twin daughters , Jane and Jenny in the devastation that Patek and his co-conspirators led almost ten years ago .	-5.1026
With tears she said fighting that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.1696
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other kerle .	-2.4201
“ Put him before a shooting command , ” said Corteen to AAP .	-3.1722
I have to live every day with the fact that I will not get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughter any more .	-3.5131

Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-2.2169
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but not call mobile calls )	-2.7423
Travellers can now use their electronic equipment to read , work , games , music , and to view films , but do not telephone with the mobile phone , so the new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-19.1150
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.6226
How quickly they would be implemented depending on the respective airline , FAA staff Michael Huerta declared at a press conference .	-3.1895
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of airline staff and the regulations for the confidence of equipment in accordance with the new rules .	-5.3796
The FAA declared that it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.3774
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines .	-1.8461
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could very soon authorise the expansion of electronic equipment , ” the FAA announced its release .	-3.8734
Currently , passengers must disable smartphones , tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed .	-3.0727
They can only restart them until the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain has the green light .	-4.4745
When entering the country , passengers must disable them again and they must not restart them until the aircraft is landed .	-5.1548
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are safe against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at the start , landing and on the rolling field , the FAA declared .	-5.1052
Most new traffic aircraft and other aircraft converted to greater height for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.1635
Laura Glading , president of the professional association , welcomed the changes .	-2.1778
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit ” , commented glading .	-3.2711
We are frankly sorry to feel watchful about this issue .	-3.2978
Yet Internet connections to surfing , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained banned , the Authority explained .	-3.5363
Passengers are asked to transfer smartphones , tablets and other devices into air mode .	-3.0056
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines for refusing to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked on the flight .	-4.2427
And heavier devices like laptops must continue to be studied as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-3.3669
Mobile calls remain prohibited during the flight .	-2.5340
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-2.4188
FAA may lift a ban on certain electronic equipment at start and landing .	-2.8974
Last month , Mark Rosenker said that the National Transportation Safety Board , National Transportation Safety Expert for National Transport Affairs at CBS News , mobile phones would still be viewed as a risk .	-4.0446
“ Mobile are really a problem , not only because they could cause potential disruptions in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disturb sending masts , ” says Rosenker .	-4.8528
A consultative committee of the industry created by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allowed a wider use of personal electronic equipment .	-3.8695
In recent years , the pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-2.5141
Critics like the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid security reasons for the ban .	-2.8965
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-3.9812
In some studies , there is talk of forgetting or ignoring up to one third of passengers .	-3.7490
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by passengers after reports on disruptions of navigation and communication devices had become known by passenger-led UK radios , which were the latest technology trend .	-4.8020
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed and approved by the FAA that they do not make any electronic interferences .	-3.2315
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for several years , when the flight level is reached .	-4.1650
Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences .	-3.5619
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.4425
Today ’ s electronic devices generally give much less radiation than previous generations .	-2.6194
E-reader , for example , only pass minimal radiation when sheeting .	-4.1216
But when downloading or sending data , transmission values are stronger .	-2.0712
Amazon.com advocates relaxing the restrictions on device use by passengers .	-2.9197
In 2011 , company staff invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find out .	-4.1874
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.7622
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the disruption by the devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.3613
Other committee members said that there are only separate reports of pilots who talk about aircraft systems disrupting , and most of them are very old .	-4.2379
The committee , however , recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the dismantling of equipment by passengers in poor terms in terms of instrument landing .	-6.1506
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called it a reasonable adjustment for travellers , which today would be largely equipped with technology .	-4.1671
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience does not contradict security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of U.S. Travel Association .	-2.4930
Birds rescued from North Sea Bohrinsel Rescued Air Service	-3.5616
A bird flown to the coast by air rescue , which was exhausted on a North Sea drill island , has been released again in na.	-27.6141
The water rall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was applied by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa .	-3.9821
Colin Seddon , head of the centre , said : “ This water rall was probably a winter train bird from northern Europe , stopped by the strong winds above the North Sea . ”	-3.8563
Apparently the exhausted bird looked refuge on the drill island .	-2.1941
He added , “ he could no longer fly further , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.3317
In its release , the water rall was fit and healthy again .	-3.5596
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.5904
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and define what those in Britain want to change our relations with the EU .	-3.3904
To this end , we have commissioned the biggest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-3.0061
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business leaders who represent about British corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.3868
The survey 's results will surprise many .	-2.2312
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while stagnants in the EU .	-3.0783
They hope that government will favor new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil , rather than the long and hard process of reforming obscure EU institutions .	-4.1529
When asked about certain legally regulated issues – from the right of cartels to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be reversed to Westminster .	-22.5943
There was general dissatisfaction about the single market , because , according to companies , the costs of Brussels regulations would now be overwhelmed by the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed with what are traditionally the most pro-European .	-6.1773
Finally , and probably most says , our survey of economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and not a relationship with the EU based on trade .	-4.1696
This recognition , found among businesses of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the stiff of action back to Britain .	-5.5572
Much is at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of leaving the EU in a referendum .	-4.1869
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of the UK ’ s membership conditions in the negotito join the part of the in the in the in the EU .	-14.6244
It also shows that businesses expect a significant shift in power back to the UK from renegotiation .	-3.4928
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union .	-19.1915
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.5929
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gasera	-2.7043

Miller said , the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “ eliminated forever . ”	-3.0331
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at reasonable rates when the whole project starts in 2015 .	-2.7453
According to Gazprom , construction works in other orderly countries are to begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-14.8566

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff before accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences	-30.9969
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales ( NSW ) had been charged for sexual delicacies in connection with children before charges against child carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were raised in 2011 , as the Royal Commission learned for children ’ s sexual abuse in the in the . the in the of the in the of the of of the of and in .	-17.8934
But , in the opening statement before the Commission , the YMCA stated that ‘ one had never dealt with an incident of sexual abuse of children ’ .	-4.4354
Managing director Phillip Hare has been questioned about a case in which a YMCA employee was charged for offences with child pornography , and another one in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 was condemned for the abuse of children entrusted to him .	-5.5417
Hare said to Gail Furness , one of the Commission 's assistant lawyers , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-2.6632
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that ‘ there were external reviews of the YMCA , recognising YMCA as the foremost front of child security ’ .	-5.2688
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Department of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.4424
Hare , who started with the YMCA 21 , acknowledged that the management “ failed from me to down ” in the recruitment of Lord , and did not ensure that employees were aware of their commitments to notify infringements of child safety directives .	-5.0130
Lord was condemned for sexual offences at twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA .	-3.4201
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.4616
Hare disputes , however , that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented the employee from reporting Lord ’ s infringements concerning children ’ s security .	-20.4783
The employees said that she had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , cared for her privately as a baby sitter , put her on his boot , said that he loved it , and let children play with his mobile phone .	-6.1366
Danielle Ockwell , whose leader , Lord , and whom had asked for a training for the protection of children , was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service provider Jacqui Barnat , who was Lords superior to YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time was very unacceptable . ”	-5.5448
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have had the courage to report to their chairman .	-5.0507
Instead , he said , instead , her friendship with Lord has affected their judgment , which is why she had not reported it .	-4.6217
Hare declared that he told the Management Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson to draw the organization from the “ Jonathan Lord Incident ” was “ not reporting ” by employees , and the Management Board approved it .	-4.5853
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations occurred was made by the manager of the YMCA child services , Liam Whitley .	-3.6112
He said that it should be prevented from contaminating the evidence , but that was “ overly ” and badly implemented .	-3.7770

In an interview this evening , during the fifth anniversary of his leaving office , the 59-year-old told his views on various domestic issues .	-2.7577
Since its resignation in June 2007 , after a decade , Blair has largely avoided speaking about British politics , and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as messenger of the Quartet of the Middle East peacekeepers .	-4.5728
On the question of whether he would like to return to Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted by the evening standard from London : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this happens , i.e. ... ”	-3.8229
When horse show experts entered Cardiff to cut the horse of the year , they knew that a hard competitive battle existed .	-5.0876
But no one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-1.9794
The Knirps , who is not even in the Kindergarten , and only a few months ago , took his first steps , and his Shetland pony Toffee loosened through the three rounds and brought the first prize – with 30 adults behind him .	-6.0989
The inseparable couple , both size , have been praised due to their appearance , behavior and styles in annual competition , organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-5.3067
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he put his cart into a bright angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-5.0313
Fenton was praised by the judges for their natural skills in dealing with the pony , which was far above his age .	-3.8597
And Toffee received best-notes for his appearance and personality .	-1.8168
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and since every day with the Shetland pony .	-2.5504
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great opportunity . ”	-13.0595
They had to fight against the entire field of participation and have gone out of place with gold pocal and rosette .	-4.8448
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with substance , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.4304

China ’ s Newspaper Should “ Reform ”	-2.9523
A Chinese newspaper , which on the front page called for the release of a reporter who had been charged for disaffection , was supposed to be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-4.3860
The Neue Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-22.6262
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a partial firm .	-3.7195
Now the new express was undergoing “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-2.9928
The “ Rectification Order ” was issued by the Guangdong Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television .	-14.4139
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which belongs to Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several inappropriate reports on the listed company Zoomlion between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-13.3388
“ New Express editorial management was disorderly , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-2.5470
She said that one decided to “ impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter licence . ”	-3.2768
Furthermore , “ Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete rectification of the New Express and recommended to investigate the relevant responsible at the New Express and immediately check the New Express leadership team . ”	-5.1869
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported on supposed financial irregularities to a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-2.7223
Having been arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and behind his journalistic work .	-2.3638
But then Chen appeared in public television , and admitted that he had published wrong reports against payment .	-4.4657
“ In this case , I have damaged Zoomlion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the state news broadcaster CCTVin rel.	-18.3779
I did it first and foremost because I was out of money and glory .	-2.4281
I have become clear that I have acted wrongly .	-2.3596
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page and said that it was failing to check the reports correctly . not un. the of and the of in . the of the of in and of	-20.5198
Several well-known suspects have recently passed confessions on television .	-2.4018

Discovering Drug Tunnels with US-Mexico Railways	-2.8298
One of the most refined tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electrical railway operations , has now been discovered .	-10.4529
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres measuring tunnels as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever found .	-3.2749
The tunnel that runs in the Zickzackpattern over a length of just six football fields connects storage halls near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.5804
In the area there are countless unseemly warehouses , which makes it easier to hide lorries with drugs .	-3.2776
The tunnel was closed before drugs were unrecognized , the authorities declared .	-2.6992
The discovery of the tunnel was secured eight and a half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine , the records of the court .	-3.1591
Three men working as drivers according to the authorities have been charged for ownership and intended sales of Marihuana and Cocain .	-3.5816
They are threatening prison sentences for ten years and lifelong .	-2.9237
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extended subterranean network of dewatering channels .	-2.9869
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.0988
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to .	-13.8761
In 2010 , authorities found a scarcely 640 metres long passage with railways that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storage houses in San Diego .	-4.3298
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr are still loving themselves .	-14.3935
Actors Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.2826
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love himself .	-17.6450
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn .	-1.2266
Actors Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.7171
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hope it " . .	-21.6140
Kerr and he himself still loved himself , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-2.9380
" We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn " . and .	-17.3596
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , in 2011 their sons were born Flynn .	-2.2776
The veganism , according to Lexica , is subject to vegetarianism , but it is very different from it .	-4.0926
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of saw places , ice or a powerful Edamer , these muddles are not on the menu of a vegan .	-5.1764
Milk , cheese , egg , besides the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan leaves off from all animal products - also honey .	-4.2937
What remains , one might wonder , but with a closer look at the vegan food world is characterised by a considerable wealth of imagination .	-5.4120
" Brota distances are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the holder of the House of Reform , which has a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.7144
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-2.7083
For 13 years , the born New Zealand vegan has lived , in Lampertheim he finds everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I around my diet and became vegetarian " .	-4.7718
At the turn of the century , the next step was taken and I became Vegan .	-2.3429
" The conviction came not only because of the diet but because of the boot choice " , says Proctor , who prefers normal leather of art .	-4.4940
He recognized that there are also other daily concerns without animal products .	-3.0629
First and foremost , vegan is ethics .	-1.5490
" I do not want animals to die for me " , Proctor speaks out the maxims of vegans that extend to the whole consumption behavior .	-3.1982
Rather than trusting burgers , stirries or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered new products , enthusiasm increased .	-3.5504
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " in fact vegan is not a waiver , not an asket , but it is an enrichment " .	-5.8589
And that is precisely the conditioning that some were still so well meant to fail .	-5.1478
" The addiction factor is a crucial factor that leaves many quickly abandoned , similar to smoking , " Proctor displays a comparison .	-3.6072
And addresses : ' Certain tastes are not on the pet ' .	-3.9521
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-2.5665
" You can generate the same effect in another way " , shows the vegan .	-4.0558
For a grill festival , Proctor , for example , brings aubergins , champignons and also some vegan sausages .	-3.6541
It pays attention to a balanced , varied nutrition , which should also taste many times .	-5.1418
Of course , you want to have something between teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.5766
" It should taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food " , said Proctor .	-3.1689
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , did not suffer .	-2.1685
For me , the change had a positive aspect .	-2.2231
I do not take a foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin share .	-3.1262
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan .	-1.6260
" My blood values are excellent , I often check out " , betrays Proctor .	-2.8627
In particular , many vegan simus-critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-2.4477
" Since animals are fed with feedingstuffs rather than grass pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cold rest , the vitamin B12 is high " , Proctor finds .	-5.1667
For vegans it is also possible to take the coenzym in the form of tablets .	-2.8627
" My B12 values are in order " , he explains .	-1.9827
Much ways should not be done by Proctor for food procurement .	-3.6408
Every supermarket has soyamilk and other products .	-3.2609
I find everything I need on site .	-2.2002
Only from and on buy something special .	-3.3308
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but so it is known as " ordinary " finished products " .	-4.5192
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly assumed .	-3.6601
" In the kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small tins you can achieve good if not partially better results " , says Proctor .	-4.0547
Margarine instead of butter , a little more backpowder and carbon acid instead of Ei , with his vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring his swinging parents to an amazement .	-5.5290
Family festivals give the vegan a new root .	-2.3107
This has momentum , when cooked together , that has a new place .	-4.6832
" The situations that can arise in this are as different as the people themselves " says Proctor .	-2.9556
He was of course already sceptical about this .	-2.9769
Do you not taste my food any more ?	-2.9053
" Should I feel bad now , because I drink milk ? " - we need to act as a vegan with fingertip .	-4.2740
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be an enclave date .	-19.0469
More precisely , the everyday world does not seem as vegan as suggested - and the vegan does not appear to be as limited in everyday life as it is normal. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-17.0625
Also Fast Food is allowed .	-1.2266
Pomes are there everywhere !	-2.1974
" Many doner shops offer falafels , or just a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-3.3883
In a pizzeria he spreads out on pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , everything a question of habit .	-4.2540
The restaurants are standing up for themselves so slo.	-5.2343
" When I began to feed vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult , " the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to the people who draw attention to it " .	-4.9198
" When enough demand comes , they may be inclined to complement the menu , " he hopes .	-2.7807
Vegan restaurants develop , for example , the combuses in Mannheim or the café bird free .	-3.1876
Proctor desires that other restaurants at least have a vegan menu .	-2.9468
Basically , vegan dishes are there for everyone .	-11.7820
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.0642
" Meat dishes are exclusive , however , in the true sense of the word because they exclude others " , displays Proctor .	-3.1630
" If you want to avoid food scandals , Veganism is a safe way to make the allergenic part impossible from the outset , " says Proctor .	-3.4494
But purchasing vegan products can be somewhat difficult at the beginning .	-2.9341
In particular , if you learn to understand that can also be contained in earthquakes of animal additives as color generator , you seem to leave the courage quickly with following ethics with so many hurdles and traps .	-5.4707
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients , the food and cleaning agents .	-3.6134
" After and after you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to respect " It is sometimes better to do than stop or stumble " , white Proctor knows .	-4.9637
Veganism , it is an important moral fingerprint that strikes awareness .	-3.4768
Perhaps he does not manage to take his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to challenge their habits critically .	-4.2175

British police make Assange an extradition notification to .	-17.8933
The British police have today handed over a delivery notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge in the ecuadorian embassy in London and applied for asylum .	-3.8358
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian was “ asked to stand up , ” which asked him to appear in a police guard , and added , if he failed to do so , he threatened his arrest .	-5.8697
Assange is threatening to deliver to Sweden because of the indictment in a sex offence , having exhausted its possibilities under British law , since the Supreme Court rejected its appeal to extradition earlier this month .	-4.6979
Because he feared that Stockholm would be extradited to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked for political asylum to the South American country .	-4.1027
Scotland Yard asked “ a 40-year-old man to stand up for a police guard at a time we chose , ” said a spokesman .	-4.4082
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on deposit .	-1.9752
The message did not issue a comment on the delivery of the police invitation .	-3.0081

Tax on foreign property owners against London ’ s Speculational Bubble	-2.7225
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but it is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a stamp tax of 7 % on apartments in the 2012 budget , costing more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers who consider apartments as a company and not as individuals .	-4.9104
Already , revenues from the stamp tax on housing in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which were 708 million pounds in the 2012 / 13 tax year , collected revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North-East , the North West , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-4.2807
Cook said : “ After increases in stamp tax on high-price housing and the introduction of related legislation against circumvention , it is difficult to say that high-quality properties are too low , irrespective of the impact of the outdated community tax system . ”	-4.9338
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more reticent about buying real estate in London , or selling owners , ” he added .	-3.4418
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market price – in the wealthy London South-West Belt , which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon , was expensive by 11.8 % last year .	-4.5714
The prices in Central London had an even-handed annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market ” in which the south-western part of the city , the North ( 7.4 % ) , and the East ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , savils .	-4.1917
Scientists were able to draw more light on the context of a dog ’ s tail mood .	-4.3906
Previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail moved more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left side in nervous dogs .	-4.0825
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.3897
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist of the University of Trento , said : “ Man is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli causing positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.4171
Here we tried to look at this in other species .	-2.2921
He also noted that dogs , like humans , were the right brain half responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in the feelings .	-3.8504
To learn more about how dogs respond to the side of their kinds of tailors , researchers monitor the animals while these films looked at other dogs .	-4.3879
They measure the heart rate of the four pipes and analyzed the behavior .	-3.4136
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-3.3025
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown the dogs with dogs – either a natural faithful version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we were able to manage the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-4.5335
When the animals saw how an otherwise impressive dog moved the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the moving dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-3.8646
Was the tail negation mostly left ( from the perspective of the dog that weeds ) , heart frequency rose and they looked trouble .	-5.9482
In the view of Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-2.2690
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not .	-4.2211
He said , “ If you have different meetings with other dogs and the walk is linked to the tail more in a direction of kind behavior , and the right is rather a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.6560
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to understand the animal ’ s emotions better .	-3.6736
John Bradshaw , expert in dog behavior and hostipendiat at the Faculty for Animal Health of Bristol University , stated that this was not the first study to investigate whether left and right dogs were important .	-4.6357
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn the head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .	-3.5011
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog , when his tail wedens left and not right , rather than becoming disturbing – exactly different from the Italian study . ”	-6.0353
According to his statement , the differences could therefore touch that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in the films or the robot dogs as a dog .	-4.3372
A study on how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.3786
“ Although there are considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes , many of the details still have to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” Bradshaw .	-3.9024
But simply record their behavior , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-4.1133

In February , Pope Francis appointed First Cardinals	-2.3882
Pope Francis will first appoint new Cardinals of the Catholic Church on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursabout . the of of and the of of of . the of of of of	-16.2725
Cardinals are the leading clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also those who choose a Pope so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor .	-4.1991
Currently there are 201 cardinals .	-1.4776
However , a cardinal reaching an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope election – a group of 120 “ elected cardinals . ”	-3.7791
In a statement where the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi said , a Vatican spokesman , that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony was held to appoint the new cardinal , which is also known as a consistency .	-4.3930
“ Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the consistency in February so that other meetings that require cardinal participation can be planned ” said Lombardi .	-3.6351
Jack Valero from Catholic Voices said that the number of elected cardinals would probably decline until February .	-3.2452
He declared that a Pope normally appoint as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of selected cardinals amounts to 120 again , and so many cardinals over 80 as he wants .	-4.0975
The consistency next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , says Valero .	-3.3149
There is a certain overhang on the part of Europe and Italy in particular .	-2.5785
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-1.8485
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.4739
The cardinals will also be the first to call since the formation of the Cardinals Council established by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the church .	-4.6330
In the past , the Pope alone decided .	-2.1818
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.2386
He said that it was “ good possible ” that Francis asked the Cardinals for advice .	-3.5198
But we have not been in this position until now – that is all new .	-3.5194
Valero said that typically bishops from large places would be called cardinal , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints . ”	-3.3606

Obama ’ s Memorias about the 2008 election campaign was a sad memory of what would have been possible .	-2.6472
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-1.9269
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .	-1.6379
It is a book that I believed would stop and give me hope during the true-sensitive second year of my medical studies .	-4.8251
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” ( courage to win ) and describes the Memorien Barack Obama as presidential election in 2008 .	-3.2435
When I am ready and go to bed in the evening with my patients , the book leads me back to a time when politics inspired millions and robbed breath to a speech .	-5.4819
The election was kept to a landslide and news speaker in order to recognize the historic importance of this hour .	-4.7346
My class camerades went to joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .	-3.4714
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.4925

And then I close the book .	-1.0123
Again to switch to the present is a malicious awakening as if you are going out of a dream .	-5.0108
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.3575
In the years since I voted for the first time , something has changed .	-2.9009
But it is not what I could have imagined .	-2.2403
I recognise the great and versatile things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced silence of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens .	-3.1079
I also believe that the party political blockadetactic has too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few .	-4.1385
But , having defended the Obama Government countless times against colleagues and well-known , I have reached the end of my attempts to st.	-14.8332
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.4025
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to interrogate or kill innocent children from overseas drones .	-2.8326
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on American private life and why whistleblowers are punished who disclose government misconduct .	-3.4157
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without proceedings , and why public financing and expenditure limits will be circumvented during the presidential election .	-3.7824
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the ‘ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government ’ .	-3.4066
And recently , it cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.1572
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected .	-10.6693

Obviously , the Members ' Office is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown Massacre shape public discussion .	-3.7401

And that disturbs me most .	-1.9442
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.1309
Mitt Romney represented a confusing and unbalanced alternative that he did not seem to be able to determine his direction and positions .	-3.1572
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from pressure for future elections , would fulfil the hope we had heard so long ago .	-3.4266
But , with Obama ’ s fall in approval at less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become so harder by this book .	-3.9504
It gives me the longing for the many promises that have dissolved in air .	-3.1457

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had a conflict of interest in parental leave .	-13.6869
The billionaire and honourable Member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans because his daughters become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .	-3.4415

The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether carbon and mining taxes are deleted or cut .	-3.3658
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of abbot would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.4295
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether she receives or not , ” said Palmer .	-3.8042

Palmer also criticised the use of pens when marking the ballot .	-2.0234

RBS suspends two foreign-exchange dealers	-1.7076
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign exchange department , as two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that global authority investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market takes off rapidly .	-4.8851
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they worked with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market , where USD 5.3 trillion change the owner every day .	-3.4011
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to suspend the expanding investigation that entails the scandal around the Libor interbanking business .	-4.2375
The Bank , which made no comment on suspension , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .	-2.8628
“ Our investigations on this subject go further and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-2.8359
Last month , the situation individuals stated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier retailer to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-3.7864

UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that it examined a suspected manipulation of the foreign-exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-3.9540
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Ministry of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are dealing with accusations that bankers are to agree to transactions on the currency market .	-15.8479

Banks permeate instant messages and emails from several years to search for misconduct .	-3.5528
News about these investigations has turned traders into an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currency limits the opportunities for speculators .	-19.9629
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-2.9704
A leading retailer noticed that , despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to “ being able to influence the market with very low ticket pric“ a in terms of exand . the the of the of and the in the of of the of	-15.7912

Before the action of the BI was a transparent with the message ' We were in favour ' .	-3.3532
But that does not disturb the citizens ' initiative of about 20 members .	-3.8378
Your motto on the big poster was " We are against Bauruins " .	-2.7379
She wanted to draw attention to the danger of even greater ruins on the Swiss meadow - one day the huge project should fail .	-4.4339
In conversation with many passers-by before the building site , it became clear that some citizens believe that , with the implementation of the city ’ s project , many will go better , although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project like the BI .	-6.0583
But they start to resign because the city delays these responses further , i.e.	-3.8599

Recent occasion for Rangnick ’ s criticism was yellow for men at 3 : 0 against Grödig last Sunday , where the Senegalese became an alleged actress - which was not , of course , as the TV images showed .	-5.6739
" A crass misdecision " , Rangnick , the arbitrator Harkam called " totally overburdened " .	-4.5248
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hütter after the party .	-2.7318

In December , the City Regulations Assembly will then have to decide .	-2.9327
The IHK Frankfurt retail committee considers this to be ' no good idea ' .	-2.7367

According to Tribukait , the tourist aim of the village is to preserve the old pasture wine field with its specific protected living space types by opening up and connecting to the pastures that still exist .	-6.6963
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass coppers , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest land .	-3.4589
They need these free connections to preserve .	-3.3855
Tribukait said that she does not want to fail to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-3.3735
This planning does not just add seamlessly to the current measure .	-2.9101

Egypt ’ s First Free Elected President	-2.5499
Mohammed Morsi dismisses the office , but his day of triumph is not likely to mean the end of political disputes in Egypt .	-3.8448
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the first freely elected president of the country , hence the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been driven out of office 16 months earlier .	-4.0512
With his introduction to the Supreme Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-2.9033
He dismissed the oath before the 18 black robe-clothed judges of the judge , who had their seat on the nil and found an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.6064

Hundreds of soldiers and police watched the building when Morsi arrived shortly after eleven hours of local time in a small autokonvoi .	-4.1848
Only a few hundred supporters had assembled before the court to crush the new president , and , unlike the presidential punk of the Mubarak era , traffic was stopped shortly so that the Autokonvoi could cross the normally lively road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-6.1140
As an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he not only presented himself as a candidate of the Islamists , but all those who wanted to pursue the 2011 insurgency against authoritarian Mubarak .	-4.8508

Johanna Rahner wants to follow up in the forum on how today people classify " last things " after death .	-3.4073
If people had known too much of this in the past centuries , putting on the images of sky and hell , " which , to date , shape our ideas " , contemporary prophetic lessons are characterized by the hopes of completion rather than a certain embarrassment or even incongruity .	-6.9656

For 21 years , Georges Bwell saw how his sick father constantly lost awareness and travelled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-13.6512
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 by a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.7913
First , he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation expanded to his brain and caused a hematom there that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.3186
“ There were no neurosurges in Cameroon , ” said Georges Bwelle .	-2.2556
We would have brought it out of Cameroon if we had the money .	-2.2396
Instead , Bwelle spent years accompanied his father in full clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.5956
“ It is not easy ” , comments Bwelle .	-13.2899
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and it is not the first .	-4.2808
There are many patients .	-1.2865
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.4766
The situation has hardly changed , since Bwelle ’ s father in 2002 .	-2.3032
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , the World Health Organization .	-2.1772
In contrast , the ratio is in the United States with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.0587
But even if there is a doctor for them , most camerooners could not afford to visit .	-2.7012
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and almost three quarters of health spending in the country are private .	-20.9916
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-1.3309
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.8742
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffered to see Bwelle 's decision to do something about it .	-3.8744
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer carried out 700 free operations last year .	-2.4310
He was doctor himself and works as a vascular in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.3095
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.1567
Since 2008 he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-1.9569
Almost every Friday , he constrains and up to 30 people are in small buses and drive on the roof through unsolicited terrain to the villages who need help with the covered medical equipment .	-6.1738
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-2.1206
More than once , they had to move the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.1702
But when they arrive , they are received like heroes : a celebration , vocals and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.7438
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and shaft – with its broad smile and its borderless energy – is happy to celebrate .	-4.7056
The next morning , the team will start investigating hundreds of patients .	-2.5717
“ Per trip we treat 500 people ” says Bwelle .	-3.4342
They come from 60 kilometres around the village – and walk .	-15.1874
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.2651
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.5495
Others receive crushes , donated glasses , or free birth documents – a document that is needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.6893
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local stunning .	-2.5530
The operations are usually held in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the intervention patients stand up and go in the recreational area to make space for the next .	-5.6393
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group ’ s generator and works Bwelle and its volunteers until early hours of Sunday .	-4.8350
It is a hard pensum , but the village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .	-2.6842
“ They drum all night so that we can stay wake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-3.3253
On Sunday the team returns to the city tired , but proud of the work done .	-3.6552
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with their work , it makes a huge difference for the people they help .	-4.4034
A man explained that the free operation of a fraction of services he received now enables him to work again .	-3.2339
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.1952
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.4344
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , says Bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .	-15.0238
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied medicine in Philadelphia in the second year at Drexel University , and is voluntarily involved in Bwelle ’ s group .	-3.7707
He is always in hospital or is trying to raise money for the organisation so that it can go to these campaigns .	-3.4207
For medical and health students such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe , this is an opportunity to gather practical experience that they would never get at home .	-13.0662
“ We can be at operations where we help dismantle blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , ” says O 'Malley .	-3.2409
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.6882
The students usually pay their trip to Cameroon themselves and carry frequently donated sanitation material .	-2.9561
However , once in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over accommodation , transport and guidance .	-4.0824
" He is without a doubt a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.3663
He devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no borders .	-2.4574
Nearly permanent work is no burden for Bwave .	-3.2669

The old man Santiago cannot do anything for fishing .	-3.4841
Thus the two simply complement themselves great .	-3.5208
One almost believes that the wrinkles of the old man , of whom the fishing young manolo speaks , can be seen . in the the of , the of and .	-17.5957
If Santiago is tired of life on the chair , it is real for Janson .	-3.4520
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson is excellent .	-3.7715
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and his will .	-3.2729
Janson is on stage in long distances as a single player .	-4.0122
He manages to focus the attention of the audience , so his monologists are not boring at any moment .	-3.1025
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea is made up of blue lit water bottles .	-4.0494
Director Jens Hasselmann let the old man operate in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-22.8292

About 120 meters of length , a sewage channel is preserved from the Roman times .	-4.5047
Those who visit Cologne will not pass the Dom .	-18.0366
Around 157 meters , the two towers stand in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.9023

The tour starts unspectacular : " We start at the underground garage " , says schulze .	-2.9868
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted an autogenic city , and that is why the remains of the old wall remained only what was not too big .	-4.7068
Most of the parking house users are therefore running ahead of the Roman remains today and only replace their car .	-6.1478
But if you look more accurately , the parkdeck D2 discovers an archaeological foundation separated by metal grids .	-5.1162
About five metres high ruins from large stones are seen .	-4.0082
" There are remains of the Roman city walls , built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " says Schulze .	-3.1300
Before going back to the daylight , school leaves the participants at the top of the parking level a glance in a dark , 15 meters deep box .	-5.9072
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly perceived .	-3.0912
