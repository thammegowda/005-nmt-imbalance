Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , soft ' policy is long forgotten when it ever began .	-3.6444
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is judged as to whether it is acceptable to the leadership of the parties .	-15.8816
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s inauguration , because my colleagues , with whom I had thought that I had a similar political attitude , expected me to take a turn and take positions that I would never have agreed with , be it in relation to national security or the EU internal market .	-26.5200

Thirty-two years ago , as a student , due to the neglect of the Thatcher Government , I joined Labour , which neglected my classroom to have literally collapsed , and so I tried to work for better public services for those who need it most , whether as a community or minister .	-5.9324

Robyn ’ s Melrose Christie said , “ Thanks to Ayr , they have used their chances better . ”	-2.7863
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s Captain Rory Hughes , given for the Warrior play , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Bagot took an untransformed attempt .	-4.6395
Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a punishment before he reached a mid-term hit and then made a solo attempt to bring him to the 17 : 5 break execution for Ayr .	-6.6034

President Donald Trump is beginning this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.0042
It is the first of five planned electoral events next week , and Trump also visits the Republican-friendly states Tennessee and Mississippi on his tour .	-3.4599
While confirming his candidate for the vacant post on the Supreme Court , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the forthcoming midterm elections , as otherwise fears that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-4.6778
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye this evening , and how can you look at it online ?	-19.1506

You can track Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye online via live stream on YouTube .	-2.3034
Trump will certainly go into the hearings that took place this week regarding the allegations of sexual abuse against his candidates for the place of the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation of the office that the Senate must take place was postponed by at least a week until the FBI inquiry was completed .	-5.8786
However , the main aim of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans , who face a decisive election in November .	-3.2602
According to Reuters , the Trump campaign aims to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-2.7519
“ The majority in Congress is primarily on the president ’ s agenda , which is why he visited Reuters just before the turbulent campaign season as many states as possible , ” said a spokesperson of the Trump campaign , who does not want to be named .	-5.7382
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , this evening at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling , the electoral event supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania could attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-3.8082
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the federal state that he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 , will be visiting for the second time this a mon, in .	-20.2408
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia , Patrick Morrisey , who lags behind in the polls .	-2.6319
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , Politologist at the University of West Virginia , said that it is not a good sign of Morrisey that the president must come to improve his surveys .	-2.9355
Ryder Cup 2018 : The Team USA is ready to fight to sustain hope for Sunday singles .	-24.1845
After three unilateral encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.4285
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-3.5297
So where would they say the momentum now ?	-1.8283
“ You had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so there is a little momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew for the day . ”	-4.2398
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of 4 points , and twelve others are still to be played .	-4.1470
But Americans , as Spieth says , feel something windy in their sails , and there was much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and each of three of four points .	-4.4017
Spieth was a good example from the outset .	-2.8993
These cheap juble cries were louder than his round continued , he sent a decisive putt to reach a score in game 4 after he and Thomas had 2 points after 2 matches .	-6.2487
His joy over the putt on the 15th hole with which she won the game was so that he thought he was still in the victory of the Americans .	-3.5376
" You really have to concentrate strongly and only worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.2013
That is all that each player still has .	-2.8136
18 holes to leave the impression .	-1.3640
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.7896
Europe 's strange but admirable couple plays errorless and simply makes everything right .	-2.8499
" Moliwood " was the only pair that did not obtain a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but she also avoided them on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-3.6155
This course and the way in which their energy seems to flow and from this leaked quantity of spectators , makes it the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes beyond Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who sealed a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-5.6126
Both probably simultaneously on different holes .	-2.6128
To speak of a European victory now would be too premature .	-2.3784
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-3.0630
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine die Spaniard and the Swede into a hole from which they never come out again .	-3.3861
On Sunday , however , there is nobody who helps you from your hole . the to a and a . a a to the the of the . the and a a of	-20.3383
Because of the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in the hand turn , it is very fascinating to observe the fourballs and Foursomes from close proximity .	-4.9472
Europe has played better than it has done so far , taking a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the team of the US has the desire to fight what some , particularly Stateside , have doubted .	-5.3687
Europe leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Finalday	-2.8856
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the fourth and fourth games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-3.6572
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its previous balance sheet to four points in Le Golf National .	-3.3721
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took to preserve the trophy it lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team fighting with suspension at the morning Fourballs , and won the series with 3-1 .	-4.4869
The US offered more resistance to the fourth , gaining two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.4667
The team of Jim Furyk requires eight points from the 12 individual games of Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.6790
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend " Molliwood " , is only the second pair that wins four points from their first four matches in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-4.1103
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was considered to be sure that they would beat a disillusioned woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.1879
Woods , who slipped through two parties on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 parties in four balls and four and seven in consequence .	-4.2837
Justin Rose , rested for the morning Fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in Foursomes and suggested in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – Square one and three in the world .	-3.3056
But , on a pleasant day south-west of Paris , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.8407
The three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday .	-2.7040
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourth pack and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in four pack after they had lost the first two holes .	-3.6062
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team returns to the singles from a four-point deficit , although Halter Furyk 's site only needs an indecision to keep trophy .	-4.4169
After two days of secondary time , however , a Sunday account looks like it would go beyond them .	-3.1871
North Korea says that there will be “ no unilateral disarmament without confidence . ”	-2.5528
North Korea ’ s Foreign Minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its distrust in the United States , and that , in such circumstances , the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.6868
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took " significant goodwill measures " last year , such as the hiring of nuclear and missile tests , the depletion of nuclear testing and the commitment not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.5525
" However , there is no reply from the US , " he said .	-3.0274
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there will be no way that we first disarm ourselves one-sided . ” the latter will be not .	-21.1644
While Ri revived the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , its declaration seemed significant in that it did not completely reject unilateral unnuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.1674
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to working towards “ denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , ” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-3.9084
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.4941
Washington has also opposed calls for easing the hard international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.6412
The US insists on ' denuclearization first ' ( first unnuclearization ) and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a mandatory way , and even reject the ' explanation of the end of the war ' , said Ri .	-4.5164
" The perception that sanctions can force us into the knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant to us .	-2.6197
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust . ”	-2.2091
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted at the United Nations early this week .	-2.8304
Instead , the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea ’ s leader , Moon Jae-in , over the last five months , and added : ' If the party were to denuclearize South Korea and the US on this issue , the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not have fallen into such a deadlock ' .	-4.8462
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year , when he reported to the U.N. , the General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called “ missiles ” on a suicide mission .	-4.2259
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ destroy ” North Korea last year , has praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.9968
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a time frame for this and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' . to to to a and to to to to the to the to the .	-16.7599
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.4844
However , in the United States of Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo , the UN Security Council said on Thursday that ' enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without a lack of continuation until we implement the full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-5.0855
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the funding of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programs .	-20.7129
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he will go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.3182
Pompeo has already visited North Korea this year three times , but his last trip did not go well in a .	-15.8706
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress was made , and only a few hours later North Korea condemned him “ similar demands . ”	-2.9051
North Korea , during a meeting with Moon this month , promised to dismantle a missile location and a nuclear complex if the United States adopts ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.6557
He said , Kim said , that the ' appropriate measures ' he wanted were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.4066
Harvard students participate in the course to find enough quiet .	-20.6371
With a new course at Harvard University this year , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of the study of the koffine-fitted nights .	-4.7100
A scientist has found that students at a global leader university are often denunciated when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.3253
Charles Czisler , professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course he believed to be the first of his kind in the USA .	-15.7969
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of sleeping on learning .	-2.9355
In the end a girl came to me and said , " Why is this being said to me , in my final year ?	-3.5993
She said that you never told anyone of the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he said to the telegraph .	-4.0145
The course offered this year for the first time , students explain the basics of how good sleep habits promote academic and sports performance and improve their general well-being .	-3.9203
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that the students had slept extremely little during the week .	-3.8528
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.2142
In one section there is an image of a sleeping hall where students click on coffee assets , operations , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sports performance influences by sleeping deficiencies and the importance of a sleeping time troutine .	-5.6529
In another section , participants are explaining how long-term sleeping can increase the risk of heart farm , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-4.3939
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-1.9387
We know that the behaviour of students will not change immediately .	-1.8003
" But we believe that they have a right - just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke cigarettes " , Prof. Czisler added .	-2.9375
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students make a growing problem .	-3.5428
To have enough sleep of good quality , the " secret weapon " should be a student to fight stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - not to increase , since sleep exposes the brain to hunger mode and it is constantly hungry .	-6.0609
Raymond So , a 19-year Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Cheisler design the course after he visited one of his classes in Harvard last year .	-3.3228
He said that the course had opened its eyes and pushed him into a campus-wide course .	-2.3171
The next step , he hopes , is to request all doctoral countries to complete a similar programme of study before entering the Competition University .	-4.2687
Prof. Czisler recommended the students to set an alarm when they should go to bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the blue light that is broadcast from electronic screens and LED lighting that can bring their circadian rhythm out , leading to problems when sleeping .	-5.5327
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal Herves Gerrards Men	-2.5266
Further foreign problems of the rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , Livingston came to a 1-to-0 defeat for the unsome Steven Gerrard team .	-5.2104
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in St. Johnstone in February , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrards second defeat in 18 games as trainers who left his team at eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke Premiership Chairman Hearts .	-4.9667
Menga landed seven minutes before the mid-term and an inspirational Rangers premises did not look like they could compensate .	-4.6415
While the rangers fall back to the sixth place , Livingston climbs to rank three and lies only because of the tortial difference behind Hibernian .	-4.5723
New difficulties for the rangers are revealing , since a headscarf had to be supplied with line judges Calum Spence after he was hit by an item of judgment – apparently accumulated from the foreign fans sector .	-8.2722
Gerrard made eight changes to the page that passed to Ayr and fed directly into the Betfred Cup final .	-4.1337
On the other hand , the same Livi-Elf , which decreased the hearts last week , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not allow the opponents to take space for actions at any time .	-5.9606
However , the Rangers dominated their ball-owned housing , Livingston better implemented opportunities .	-5.4089
You should have met after just two minutes , when Menga 's first stop Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregors Tor , but the midfield player moved his great change at the gate .	-5.1411
A deeper freeze of Keaghan Jacobs went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far toward rear posts .	-3.7799
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than to leave their own game in the last third .	-4.2292
Alfredo Morelos , after the expiration of the first quarter of an hour , was clearly of the opinion of having earned an elfmeter after he and Steven Lawless clashed , but Schiedsrichter Steven Thomson did not appeal to the Colombian .	-5.4775
The Rangers reached only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox Tor Liam Kelly was hardly headed by Lassana Coulibaly ’ s headjump and the hit of an unprecedented Ovie Ejaria .	-5.3061
Even though Livi ’ s opening hits might have been contrary to the game progress in the 34th minute , nobody can deny that they have earned it for their efforts alone .	-17.1655
Again , the rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.0283
Scott Arfield did not respond when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that preserved the calm and picked Menga for a simple finish .	-3.0870
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-3.9557
But Livingston repeatedly attracted the guests to play the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett feeding long balls after long balls .	-4.5639
Holt ’ s team could have extended its leadership in the final stage , but McGregor stood well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner .	-4.2653
The Rangers representative , Glenn Middleton , had another delayed claim to a penalty , since he hidden himself with Jacobs , but again he saw Thomson away .	-4.8889
The Geiger Counter ’ s Investor	-3.7141
And now one page from our alma “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger in Germany .	-3.0305
Geiger developed a method of recognizing and trade fairs of radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as a counter .	-4.8018
Since then , the counter has also become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950 ’ s , Bells of Coronado , which seems to have accumulated unlikely cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-4.7917
People : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.3114
Rogers : “ It is a ghost counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.2118
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-4.1218
Evans : “ Say times , now cracks it enormous ! ”	-14.9054
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , only a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-2.0458
But the invention bearing its name remains used .	-2.2025

A woman who was treated with the vaccine that taught the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw their egg stock cancer disappeared for more than 18 months .	-3.7424
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many types of cancer and then reinjects the cells .	-3.5131
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine ' .	-2.1566
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer , ” including breast , egg stock , pneumonia and intestinal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.7843
A similar approach to removing patients from immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukemia .	-3.8410

It did not go well	-2.0342
Kanye West was born in the studio during a Saturday Night Live broadcasting after a desperate speech in which he praised the US , President Donald Trump , saying he will take 2020 .	-5.2233
After his third song called Ghost Town , while he went a Make America Great Müffe , he heard against Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.3278

West also complained to the audience that he had had difficulty behind the stage because of his headache .	-4.1113
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.7850

The information appeared on Thursday , posted by an unknown person on on the capitol hill during a hearing of the Senate about the accusations of sexual misconduct to the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.7253
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-2.3603
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified by the source of the locations was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of a Waters staff reports Hill .	-4.6082
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continues .	-2.4581
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the reaction of this information .	-3.7487
This consistent claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.3742
Water ’ s declaration quickly led to criticism online , including the former White House ’ s Secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-3.3376
“ The denial of the matter is extremely annoying , ” said Fleischer .	-3.5558
“ This suggests that she is inappropriate as a member of the Congress .	-2.4303
If someone is accused of doing something , he must not be evil .	-2.0881
They must not be basic .	-2.7728
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-1.9268
They must be calm and left . ”	-1.7336
Meat seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the criticism of Democrats of judge Kavanaugh , accused of critics of angry during the hearing on Thursday .	-3.4404

Review of " Johnny English – One lives only trimal " – poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-3.1400
It is tradition to search in any new film with British tendency for Brexit messages , which seems to be applicable to Johnny English Reborn in 2011 .	-5.1258
Is the Ironian self-satire about the humanity at the moment the new export opportunity for the nation ?	-4.5635
In any case , for the second time , Johnny English has received the license to remassage things .	-4.0227
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent , who , despite his bizarre claims to smoothie glamour received a little clouseau , a spritzer Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy , contributed a single note to the guide lodge of fire cars in the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-6.0531
It is also based on travellers and international , mysterious Atkinson who has always left chaos in the meanwhile forgotten Barclaycard television .	-4.2202
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.2844
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor , and shortly beats the main driver against his helmet .	-21.0516
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange , especially since the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission impossible self-confident comedy as a ingredient .	-3.8465
The humor feels as though he is directed at children rather than adults , and for me the crazy missiles of Johnny English are not as inventive and focussed as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean Stumm movies .	-4.5579
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in serious difficulty .	-2.3858
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , horrifying the serving agent – an unfortunately small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.4163
Emma Thompson does her best with this Quasi-Teresa May figure , but there is not much in the script with which you can work .	-4.1790
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , since each individual active spy was compromised , someone has to get out of retirement .	-3.9304
And this means that the tollpatchy Johnny English himself , employed today as a school master in a noble facility , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy over spionage .	-5.2324
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , who is again played by Ben Miller .	-3.3816
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overwhelming , burschicose role in which Vicki Pepperdine does not fully assert .	-4.8514
So the Batman and Robin des Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-14.4207
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerous in the bann of the charismatic Tech billionaire , who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.6018
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colourful highjinks : When Kellner dresses , they inflict a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board of Voltas luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize themselves with a Virtual Reality Headset with the interior of Voltas house .	-5.5851
For this last sequence , all registers have certainly been drawn , but so pleasant and left out , it is a dramatic reminder of child television .	-5.0878
Quite moderate .	-2.6117
And as with the other Johnny English films , I could not think : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really matches his talent ?	-3.9848
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week paid for five days .	-2.7825
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party examines a radical plan where British work only four days a week , but paid for five .	-3.0664
According to reports , the party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings reached by the revolution of artificial intelligence ( AI ) to the workers by releasing them an additional day .	-4.0021
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still get the same money home .	-2.4879
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the economic agenda of the party and plans to tie the country in favour of workers .	-3.1980
The trade union Congress approved the change to a four-day week as a way for workers to use the changing economy .	-4.0812
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a review of politics is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.9733
A four day week is an objective that is in line with the party ’ s approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and the general industrial strategy of the party , but this goal will not be realized overnight .	-4.7037
The Labour Party would not be the first to advocate such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campai.	-27.7903
However , this initiative is not currently being supported by the entire Labour Party .	-2.6952
A Labour Party spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-3.0804
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to concrete his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-24.8472
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit makers ' in supply companies .	-2.3174
The shadow Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not receive their entire share because a Labour government could make deductions because of alleged misconduct .	-5.2194

In an interview on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead them to change their opinion .	-3.6982
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.6266
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.6007
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.8168
I called him after that happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.0746
He was determined , targeted , unambiguous . '	-1.9461
Graham 's voice seemed to be cast in stone .	-2.0209
" I have a view about Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb accusation , " he said .	-2.9686
“ Dr Ford , I do not know what has happened , but I know that Brett has vehemently disputed the accusation , ” added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-3.4119

But how successful has Global Citizens been to achieve its goal at 12 remaining years ?	-2.9336
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way to persuade people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel like making a real difference by signing an online petition or an online application or by sending a tweet ?	-4.5270
Global Citizens say that since 2011 , more than 19 million “ actions ” has been recorded by his supporters , who pushed for a variety of targets .	-3.6448

Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.3715
We will succeed , as the great civil law and the anti-apartheid movements ahead of us , because we are more powerful together .	-3.0449

Washington can use its navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching the markets , including in the Middle East , US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke is cited by the Washington Examiner .	-3.3730
Zinke suggested that Russia ’ s commitment to Syria – especially when it comes to inviting the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.2370
“ I believe that the reason why they are in the Middle East is that they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.3770

Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that describes itself as the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.1123
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran , and found that they are actually equal .	-2.3623
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said when he called Russia an " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-3.2314
The opinions come , while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe , and replace Russia , which was much cheaper for European consumers .	-3.9455
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to stop Germany as a “ inappropriate ” northern stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ prisoner ” to Moscow .	-4.3788
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11 billion pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters , is a purely economic project .	-3.1477

The Former Mickelson sat at the Ryder Cup Saturday at the Bank	-16.1479
American Phil Mickelson will create a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he will have to drastically improve his form of drastically no sad milestone from that . .	-14.1511
Mickelson , who was playing for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.4570
Rather than standing at the heart of what is happening , as is so often the case for the US , the fifth major winner shared his day between fires and exercises in the golf course , hoping to overcome his depth .	-4.9317
The 48-year-old is never the biggest driver , even at the height of his career , and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-4.1295
And as if the place alone would not be enough , Mickelson meets all four matches this week with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-4.5278
If Americans launch the 12 individual games have four points backwards and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-3.7075
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband , which left him otherwise .	-3.1260
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.3368
“ He has a lot of confidence .	-1.7258
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-1.8036
I would probably not have thought he was playing two games .	-2.1131
I wanted more , but this is the way we had to address it .	-4.8206
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.7108
So far , Nick Faldo holds the record about most matches played at the Ryder Cup .	-24.9660
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that never fits to the height of its individual record .	-3.2483
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times indecisive .	-3.2603
" He is witty , he is sarcastic , witty , he loves to talk people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.2244
I think that the younger players had fun this week to measure with him , that was nice to look at . ”	-4.4228
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.1717
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.3901
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an uncomfortable knight .	-16.3455
The Dane debuted in 1997 in the game in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only scarcely over the target line and won with a thin lead of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-5.1134
" It is remembered that one was in leadership in Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only scarce , " said Bjorn , after he watched the Class of 2018 , now leading with 10-6 at the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-5.2554
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.0198
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-1.3187
Go out there and do the right things .	-1.4663
It is only past when the points are displayed on the table .	-2.9749
Our goal is to win this cup , and we are focusing on that .	-18.4316
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.5825
Experienced , as his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be fast in this .	-4.7162
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.2980
Tomorrow the personal performances are coming , and that is another matter .	-2.8088
It 's great to be out there with a partner when things go well , but if you 're out alone , you 'll be tested your own capabilities as a golf player in .	-5.8954
That is the message you have to convey to the players : to get the best out tomorrow .	-2.9668
Now you are overturning to your partner , and you have to get it fully . ”	-5.1111
Unlike Bjorn , the opponent Jim Furyk will seek to cut his players individually better than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who had three of four points .	-4.1753
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , at that time he was part of the winner team in Brookline , now he is among the losers after the European team has carried out the “ miracle of medinary . ”	-5.0041
“ I remember every condemned word , ” he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had assembled his players on the way in the last day .	-3.8343
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to start as quickly as possible , as you have seen in Brookline . in in , the in the in , and the in the in , in , , the in and in	-20.3199

Returning the schedule for Germany ’ s New War ship	-2.5255
The latest German naval frigates should have been served in 2014 to replace war ships coming from the Cold War period , but according to defective systems and escalating costs , it will take at least until next year , according to reports from local media .	-6.8607
The start-up of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the board of the new Baden-Württemberg class frigators , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , so the newspaper “ Die Zeitung ” “ on the appointment the militto spoke .	-25.7925
The navy should have started the ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery burdened the ambitious project .	-3.1029
The four marines ordered by the Baden-Württemberg class in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-3.2140
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a number of missiles and ship defence missiles , and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-22.8975
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frequencies should be used for up to two years without buying the port .	-4.5630
However , the state-of-the-art warships that Germany is going to facilitate overseas power will already be outdated by the constant delays when they are finally being served , as the weekly newspaper “ Die Zeit ” notes .	-6.2655
Last year , the unfortunate F125-Frigate carried headlines when the German navy officially refused to operate the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.1557
This was the first time that after delivery the marine returned a ship to a shipbuilder .	-2.7611
The reasons for returning the ships were little known ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the war ship useless in combat operations .	-3.7500
Software defects were especially important because the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class were served by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older Bremen class frigates .	-3.9880
It also turned out that the ship would have a considerable overweight , limiting the performance and making future upgrades to the marine more difficult .	-4.4736
It is assumed that the 7,000 tonne “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II .	-3.1613
In addition to incorrect hardware , the price sign of the entire project - including the crew training - becomes the topic .	-3.9300
Instead of the EUR 2.2 billion originally estimated , the cost seems to have reached the declining level of EUR 3.1 billion ( some $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.7929
The problems with the latest flags receive particular significance in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power diminishes .	-4.4522
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the fleet of war actually “ starts the operational ships . ”	-15.0486
The official said that the problem has grown in volatility over time , as old ships were excluded , without replacing it .	-5.1766
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregatts were served by the marine .	-2.8800

Rob Dewar , Nature Consultant at the National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of the living space are most important for the bathing mice and how they are used by the species .	-5.2036
This information will help to identify the benefits of living space management , such as meadows education and forests for flat mice and other related species .	-4.6240
There has been a significant decline in Scotland and the United Kingdom over the last hundred years .	-3.6655
They are threatened by construction work that affect their sleep and loss of habitat .	-3.1688

“ Here in Threave , we have a great area for flat mice . ”	-3.7403
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good habitat .	-2.3593
But there is still much unknown about flat mice and the work that we are doing here and on other land helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-4.2745
He emphasises that it is important to check whether flat cases are there before maintenance work in buildings , and according to which it is possible that , in the case of inevitable destruction of a single sleep of maternal animals , up to 400 females and boys , a whole local population may be erased .	-7.6007
Battle mice is protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disrupt them and destroy their sleeps .	-3.9080
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.8504
She said , “ We still have a lot to learn about our flat mice and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-3.4472

Brexit : Britain would regret it forever to lose car manufacturers .	-1.7067
“ The United Kingdom would regret it lively if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Minister Greg Clark .	-3.8625
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.6764
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.2114
The Japanese automobile manufacturer said that the effects of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.0882
The plant in Burnaston , which produced the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.1324
“ When Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think it will come to our plant on production stops , ” said Marvin Cooke , Chairman of the Management Board at Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.1431
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.4249
BMW , for example , has already announced that it will close its work in Oxford after Brexit for a month .	-2.6245
The most important concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-2.6784

If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , delays can occur on the border that , according to industry indications , can lead to shortages and shortages .	-4.1557
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock in his work in Derbyshire , said the company , and that would stop production .	-3.7959
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is ‘ precisely calibrated to avoid these checks at the border ’ .	-3.2572
We have to have a deal ; we want the best deal , which not only allows us to succeed today , but also to take this opportunity , ” he said to the BBC Radio 4 programme .	-4.9411
“ The note not only of Toyota , but also of other manufacturers , is that we must absolutely be able to continue with what has become a very successful set of supply chains . ”	-3.6169
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stop might last , but warned that the cost increase could suffer the competitiveness of the plant in the long term and eventually lose jobs .	-4.6542

Trump ’ s Rosenstein ’ s Meeting could shift again , says the White House	-2.9453
Donald Trump ’ s high-calibre meeting with the Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week , ” because the battle for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-4.3472
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special advisor Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in elections , links between Trump and Russia , and the possible disability of justice by the President .	-3.4774
Whether Trump will fire or not the Deputy Prosecutor , and thus endangers the independence of Müller , Washington has given a lot of track for months .	-4.2696
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the wearing of a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th Constitutional Addition .	-3.2313
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-0.9515
But , last Monday , he came to the White House , while reports said that he was about to resign .	-3.8060
Instead , a meeting with Trump , then at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .	-2.1550
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire rosenstein , but then the session was delayed to avoid a collapse with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee , in the Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-46.7492
On Friday , Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh and delayed a full senate .	-3.8271
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-1.4671
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A date for this has not yet been fixed , it could be this week , I could see that I postponed another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-4.1913
But we shall see and I keep the press informed . '	-2.6499
Some reporters would contest this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.3601
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.0002
Sanders said that the lack of briefing is not a refusal to television reporters who behave like self-representatives , but also said : ' I will not be opposed to them in the gallery ' .	-5.7699
It then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.7660
'The President carried out more questions and answers than every President before him ' , she said and added , without evidence , ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-4.2655
Briefings will still take place , said Sanders , but if the press had the chance to ask the President of the United States directly , this is infinitely better than talking to it .	-3.7414
We are trying to do much of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and a press talk will replace if you can speak to the President of the United States yourself . ”	-3.9642
Trump answers regularly questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.6862

Weather and the impact of major social or sports events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the outside market .	-3.3176
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups continue to be under pressure , although a sales decrease of 4.8 % over the previous year will be especially painful next to continuing cost pressure .	-4.5275

Milk pump advertising , compared to cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-2.5810
A dairy pump company has caused controversial online discussions due to an advert compared to milk cows .	-4.7254
The consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedoms of mothers with this new pump .	-3.3139
Four real mothers dance in a cow in the middle of cows containing a number with the following song text : ' Yes , I melk , but you don 't see a tail ' and ' If you did not notice that it is not euter , it is my breasts ' .	-5.7439
The slogan continues : " Pump off , pump , I feed the babies , pump off , pump , pump , pump , I melk my ladies . "	-4.2575
However , the display published on the Facebook page of the company has caused controversy online .	-2.4755
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from viewers , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry in the .	-18.1517
'It is a very bad decision to advertise cows for this product ' .	-1.7611

Another commented : ' This is a funny advertising for mothers that pump ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like cows ' .	-3.3265
That is not advertising which the dairy industry praises or judges . '	-2.8761
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the decent pumps in their BHs .	-3.2438
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows .	-2.2818
Elvie Pump , however , is completely noisy , has no wires or hoses and fits into a standstill BH , leaving women free to move , keep their babies and even go to pumps .	-6.2362

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly into a camp on the Texan border .	-3.0986
The number of children imprisoned with migration rose , even though monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-3.6459
Traditionally , most sponsors have been themselves undocumented immigrants , fearing that they are expelled to risk the country when they advocate a child .	-4.2061
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-2.9822

" Almost 80 percent of those who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large part of them are criminal outside .	-3.6763

France operates more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-destroyed country .	-2.8901
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for return were fine , and he accused “ fueling some Western countries of irrational fears ” that led refugees to keep away .	-4.8790
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate return , ” said Moualem .	-1.9901
“ They actually politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.1429
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there can only be reconstruction assistance to Syria if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition proposes an end to war .	-3.9896
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last important rebel Hochburg Idlib creates the opportunity to advance political talks .	-3.5098
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops on the province supported by Russia , where three million people live .	-2.8472
But Moualem stressed that the agreement “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra front associated with Al Qaeda , “ eradicated . ”	-5.3716
