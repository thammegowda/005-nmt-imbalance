The Labour Party is no longer a large community .	-1.3788
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.9663
As a near-activists in my local party voted to criticize me , it was hardly a surprise .	-3.4515
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs who say that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-4.4105

Most of my time in the eight years of local Labour MEPs , the GC meeting on Friday evening was exactly the same .	-3.7842
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , better ' policy has long been forgotten if it ever began .	-4.5178
It has become increasingly clear that differing views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-4.4279
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s inauguration , because my colleagues , with whom I had previously thought that I would have a similar political attitude , expected me to proceed with a U-turn and adopt positions that I would never have agreed with , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-7.7850
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a tirade of abuse in the social media calling for elections to denounce the Centre ’ s politics and tell me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-6.3032
This experience did not just me .	-2.8556
I do indeed know that more luck than some of my colleagues , since the comments that are directed to me tend to be political .	-3.9393
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are exposed every day to a flood of sexist or racist abuse , but never dash back .	-4.0313
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how to normalize the extent of abuse .	-2.7149
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.6179
The reality is that we are no longer a large church and , with every motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules , the party becomes smaller .	-4.1320
In the last two years I have received a lot of advice on getting my neck out , not being so loud , and then I would be “ in order . ”	-4.9000
But for this reason I have not come into politics .	-2.1264
32 years ago , as a student , because of the neglect of the Thatcher government , Labour , this neglect caused my class room to be literally broken , so I tried to put myself in favour of better public services for those who need it most , whether as a community council or ministers .	-7.4832
I have never hidden my political views , even in the last election .	-3.0916
As for my political positions , no one should have been in any way confounded in Nottingham East , the same applies to areas in which I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.5350
I would just like to say to those who supported the Friday amendment that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that is detrimental to households , businesses , and our public services .	-4.5641
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham moment , but about my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that no threats to vote or political expeditions will prevent me from working in what I think is the best interest of all of you .	-5.4182

Robyn Christie of Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have used their chances better . ”	-2.8590
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt to travel through Frazier Climo in the 14th minute , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain , Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot got a not related attempt .	-7.7085
Climo told the management of Ayr with a crash before he reached a hit immediately at the half-term and then made a solo version with which he managed to take him in the 17 : 5 breaks for Ayr .	-8.6767
Melrose , however , began the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to turn Baghdad reduced the backlog to five points .	-4.5798
After the reboot , Ayr built the lead when a Try of Stafford McDowall was changed by Climo .	-7.5988
Ayr 's current captain , Blair Macpheerson , got the yellow card , and Melrose stopped paying the extra man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt to end a bout of pressure .	-6.2339
However , the home page came back , and when Stran Hutchinson got a yellow card because of a shackling without the ball from the border , MacPherson made a touchdown , the crazy ayr at the back .	-7.1403

“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised it at the end of August .	-2.6505
Some analysts , however , consider it unlikely that the court will vote for the benefit of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about a change .	-3.6014
The Dutch UN body has no power to give Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.4854

His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume the diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament that had been held on hold for three months after the meeting with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un in Singapore .	-5.0456
Ri says that it is “ a wishful dream ” that sanctions will continue to be imposed and the contradiction of the US against a statement that ends the Korean war will ever bring the North to its knees .	-5.9757

Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence , which continued in 2018 with outstanding examination results .	-11.3726
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , aim to offer their students and parents the best service level .	-3.0039
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for secondary education , also at universities , on their desired career path and on their role as global citizens .	-5.6434
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailored school curriculum , showing that modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-4.8767
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ When you talk to a person who understands it , you reach his mind . ”	-3.7889
When you talk to him in his own language , he goes to his heart . ”	-2.3503
This impressively demonstrates that we cannot rely on English language only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .	-3.3326
This year 's audit results show that languages are at the top of tables with the highest levels of ambition in independent schools .	-3.3342
68 % of the students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called “ high grade A ” higher class A .	-4.2392
The data collected by the 74 membership schools of SCIS showed that 72 percent of students reached a “ high degree A ” in Mandarin , while among the students who learned German , French and Spanish each reached 72 , 69 , and 63 the note A .	-5.6897
This shows that independent schools in Scotland are promoting foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future .	-2.8378
Language subjects have the same level as MINT subjects in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-4.2322
A 2014 survey by the British Commission on Employment and Qualifications revealed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty in vacant positions were due to a lack of linguistic knowledge .	-6.1453
Therefore , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their careers .	-3.4515
Given better opportunities for languages , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-4.0812

Independent schools in Scotland want to offer a learning environment that children are well prepared and to obtain the necessary equipment for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-5.0324
There is no denying that , in the global business world of the present , language remains important for the country ’ s future , and that must also be reflected in education .	-4.0521
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.4391

At the bottom of Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally you can watch online via live stream to YouTube .	-3.4197
Trump will certainly respond to the hearings this week about the charges of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh , who has to be held in office until the Senate has been completed by at least a week .	-6.7848
But the main purpose of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans that face a decisive election in November .	-4.1963
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House .	-3.5384
“ The majority in Congress is at the top of the president ’ s agenda , which is why he visited as many states as possible just before the launch of the turbulent campaign season , ” informed a spokesperson of the Trump campaign , who does not want to be named , Reuters .	-5.8670
According to the radio network West Virginia MetroNews , the electoral event taking place in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling this evening could draw supporters of Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-6.0297
On Saturday , Trump will visit West Virginia , the state he won more than 40 percentage points in 2016 , for the second time this month .	-2.0798

Ryder Cup 2018 : The American team is ready to fight to preserve hope on Sundays .	-2.9442
After three one-sided meetings , the four-figure on Saturday afternoon probably was exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-3.5267
The diminishing pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-4.3253
So where would they say the momentum now ?	-1.3152
“ You had a six-point advance and now there are four , so there is a bit of momentum , ” said Jordan Spieth when he retired for the day . ”	-5.4560
Europe , of course , has the advantage of 4 points of advance , 12 more are still to be played .	-5.4512
The Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played the whole day together and each of three out of four points .	-5.3777
From the start , spy was superior and advanced with a good example .	-4.6100
The jubilee shout was louder than his hand went on , he lost a decisive coup to reach a decision in game 4 , after he and Thomas returned 2 games .	-9.8235
His joy about the coup on the 15th hole with which they won the game was so that one thought he still believed in Americans ’ victory .	-4.3373
“ You have to really concentrate you and only worry about your own game , ” said Spieth .	-5.0663
That ’ s all that remains for each player .	-3.8867
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.4008
At this Ryder Cup in the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-3.3353
Europe 's strange but admirable pair play out in error and simply do everything right .	-3.9671
" Moliewood " was the only couple that did not reach a firm on Saturday afternoon but it also avoids the remaining nine on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-6.6310
This course and the way in which its energy appears to be flowing to and from this defunct spectator , makes them Favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who defeated a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-6.2919
Probably both in different holes .	-2.4899
Speaking of a European victory would be too premature .	-1.8988
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made brief trials with Sergio Garcia , who won the morning with his partner Alex Noren .	-3.1135
With a fire and two Doubles on the first nine columns of the Spaniards and the Swede entering a hole which they never came out again .	-6.5990
On Sunday , however , there is no one helping you out of your hole .	-2.7585
Because of the interactions between the pairs , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in hand , it is very fascinating to see the Fourballes and Foursomething from close quarters .	-7.4786
Europe has played better as a team so far and took over a significant lead in the last day , but this Foursomething singer has also shown that the team USA has the desire to fight , some of them , especially Stateside , have doubts .	-8.2204
Europe runs 10-6 at the Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.8473
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it was born from the four and fourth matches on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States .	-5.1790
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its previous record in the Le Gulf National to four points .	-5.2888
The European team of Thomas Bhorn , who took over the preservation of the trophies that they lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team with three .	-7.6998
The US offered more resistance to the Fourth and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-3.4657
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games from Sunday to keep the trophies .	-2.7347
Fleetwood is the first European Rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari , named after a sensational weekend " Molliwood " , are only the second couple that wins four points from their first four games in the history of Ryder Cups .	-4.8683
After defeating Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was safe that they would strike an undisturbed Woods and the American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-8.0103
Woods , who played through two games on Saturday , sometimes showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in four and four , and seven in consequence .	-5.8946
Justin Rose , approved for the Holy Four Ballets , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and put him in a 2 & 1 defeat in Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-6.7659
In a pleasant , peaceful day south-west of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-3.4578
On Saturday with two points , three major employers Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans .	-4.7090
They won a bold 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and then returned later to defeat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after losing the first two holes .	-5.2253
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team will return from a four-point deficit to the singles , even though Furyk 's site has only one disagreement to keep the trophies .	-6.4539
After two days of second season , a Sunday counter looks as though he would go beyond them .	-4.8612
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” unilateral disarming without confidence .	-2.4829
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continuing sanctions would deepen its suspicion of the United States and that it would not , under such circumstances , unilaterally give up its nuclear weapons .	-4.6308
Ri Yong Ho said the world ’ s annual General Assembly that North Korea took " significant goodwill measures " last year , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear testament , and the obligation not to distribute nuclear and nuclear technology .	-6.4812
" But there is no such answer from the United States , " he said .	-3.2302
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way of unilaterally disarming ourselves first . ”	-3.7593
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to dissification , in which North Korea would reward with gradual steps , his explanation seemed significant in that it did not entirely reject unilateral de-icing , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-6.3816
Ri pointed out a joint statement by Kim Jong-<unk> and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to work on a " nuclear de-icing of the Korean peninsula " while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea 's security .	-6.1259
North Korea has sought a formal end of the Korean war in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.0191
Washington also resisted the calls for a relaxation of the hard international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.7328
The US insists on ' denlearning first ' ( first de-nuclear ) and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , and even reject the ' declaration of the end of the war ' , said Ri .	-6.0884
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a wishful dream of the people we are ignorant about .	-3.2626
But the problem is that the continuing sanctions are exacerbating our distrust . ”	-3.2453
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted at the United Nations at the beginning of the week .	-3.5275
Instead , the Minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in the last five months and added : ' If the party were to be on this issue of nuclear fusion South Korea and not the US , the de-siilitarisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end ' .	-7.6263
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri 's speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly , which attacked the US mainland with North Korea 's , was inevitable after “ ” Trump ’ s President “ ” as a .	-7.4813
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ completely destroy ” North Korea last year , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea renounces nuclear disarmament .	-5.4432
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a time frame for this , saying : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months ' .	-3.8510
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council , Pyongyang , should reward for the steps undertaken .	-2.0021
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the UN Security Council on Thursday that ' The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be carried out vigorously and without some progress until we realize the full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-5.7402
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the funding of the nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang .	-3.2869
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.8065
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip did not go well .	-2.6421
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress had been made , and only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him to “ make similar demands . ”	-4.2795
North Korea promised this month , at a meeting with Moon , to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex if the United States took appropriate measures .	-5.6173
He said Kim said that the ' corresponding measures ' he intended were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalise relations with Washington .	-4.4115
Harvard pupils take part in the course to find enough peace .	-2.6543
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing machino-culture of study of koffed nights .	-4.6987
A scientist has found that students at a world leader are often powerless to help themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.4095
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course he believes is the first of his kind in the US .	-4.1781
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the effects of lack of sleep on learning .	-2.6583
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is this said to me only now , in my closing year ?	-3.0963
She said that she never told anyone about the meaning of the sleep – which surprised me , " he said the Telegraph .	-3.8966
The course that is offered for the first time this year explains the students the basics of how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their overall well-being .	-4.4298
Paul Barreira , professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after she realized that the students had fallen extremely little during the week .	-5.1457
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.7865
In a section there is an image of a sleeping bag , where students click on coffee bags , hairs , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how to influence sporting performance through lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeper routine .	-7.1155
Another section explains how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-3.3565
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their everyday life .	-2.4908
We know that it will not change students ' behavior immediately .	-1.6783
" But we believe that they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Cfmarking added .	-4.0690
The culture of giving birth a " night " still exists , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students to make sleeping away a growing problem .	-5.0037
Having enough sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also to not reach , as sleep deprivation puts the brain in the starvation mode and keeps it starve .	-6.7172
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , Professor Czeisler helped design the course after attending one of his classes in Harvard last year .	-4.3029
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to take a campusha course .	-3.7226
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all doctoral students to complete a similar study program before entering the competition school .	-3.9130
Prof. Czeisler recommended students to alert when they go to bed and wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light , which is broadcast from electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circular rhythm out of the clock , causing problems to sleep .	-7.4413
Boston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal scores Gerrards men .	-3.5396
Continue on the bottom of the Rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , in Livingston , there was 1-to-0 defeat for the unsome team of Steven Gerrard .	-5.3039
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4 : 1-triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrards ’ second defeat in 18 matches as a coach who left his team eight points behind the disappointed Prime Minister ship-chief Hearts .	-7.4406
Minga ended a hit and an inspiring runner , seven minutes before the half-time period , not seen how to achieve compensation .	-7.2163
As the Rangers fell down on the sixth place , Livingston climbed on rank three , only because of the Tordifferential behind Hibernian .	-7.1159
New difficulties for the Rangers are striking , because for regular judge Calum Spence , a headache had to be dealt with after being hit by a worm item – obviously thrown out of the sector of the forward fans .	-8.2205
Gerrard made eight changes to the side passing by Ayr and fell into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-3.2460
But if he took up the same Livi-Elf , who made a point to Hearts last week , he would have been more enthusiastic about how his well-trained team gave the opponents room for action at no time .	-7.7720
The Rangers dominated ballots , but Livingston did better .	-4.0335
After just two minutes , when Scott Pittman was the first barner to join the Allan McGregors Tor , the middle field player shout his big change at the gate .	-9.0982
Keaghan Jacobs , a deep-beat beat , then went on to captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far in the direction of the back .	-7.3944
The ladder took control , but it seemed to give more hope than darling into his own game , the last third .	-4.9763
Alfredo Morelos took a very clear view at the end of the first quarter-hour , having earned an Elfmeter after he and Steven Lawless collapsed , but referee Steven Thomson did not insist on the appeals of the column bianser .	-7.9366
The Rangers reach only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox-Torhäter Liam Kelly was hardly a headlong shot by Lassana Coulibaemia and the strike of a bisSlow OEjaria .	-7.8202
Though Livis ’ s opening tournament may have been in the 34th minute ’ s drive , no one can deny that they have earned it for their efforts alone .	-6.4826
Once again , the leaders failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-3.1799
Scott Arfield did not react as Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson assigned the ball that kept the rest and picked Menga for a simple finish .	-4.8862
Gerrard was during the interval when he sways Coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change took place immediately when the Flielmaster played to Morelos , but the stunning Kelly rants from his line to block .	-8.7774
But Livingston always attracted guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett after long balls .	-4.8096
Holts ’ team could have further strengthened their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well on refusing Jacobs before lithgow departed from the corner .	-5.4626
The ranking representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to a penalty , because he was glorified with Jacobs , but again he saw Thomson looking out .	-5.0880

And now one page from our Almach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when future physicists John Wilhelm , called Hans , was born hostage in Germany .	-4.9906
Geiger developed a method for recognising and measuring radioactivity , an invention that ultimately produced the tool known as the Geiger counter .	-4.9496
The Geiger counter has since become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950 ’ s of film " Bells of Coronado " , seemingly unlikely cowpokes-scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-5.1251
Man : ' What about all in the world is that ? '	-2.9300
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals such as uranium .	-2.4816
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals . ”	-4.6885
Evans : “ Say , but now it is big ! ”	-3.3863
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , only a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.5673
But the invention that bears its name is still being used .	-2.1945

New cancer implants can teach the immune system to see and kill malignant cells .	-2.8574
Vaccine teaches understanding the immune system , evil cells , as part of the treatment .	-2.4364
The process includes the extraction of immune cells from one patient , modification of this in the laboratory .	-3.5077
They can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer , and then re-injecting .	-3.4113
A research imprint shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-3.8753
A woman treated with the vaccine adding to the immune system to identify rogue cells saw their egg cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-4.0638
The method is to extract the immune cells from a patient to modify them in the laboratory so that a protein called HEER2 is “ visible ” that occurs in many cancers and then re-injects the cells .	-5.5111
Professor Jay Berzofsky from the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : " Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-3.0423
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer ” , including breast cancer , eggs , lung and intestinal cancer , explained by Prof. Berzofsky .	-4.9026
A similar approach to taking patients out immuncells and teach them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-5.0674

It was not doing well	-2.3407

After he performed his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while he carried a Make America Great hat , he stood up against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-5.2247
" As often I speak to a white person and she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-3.8024

Although it was not broadcast , Western Stumpitz ’ s film material was divided into the social media by the comedian Chris Rock .	-5.1909
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post .	-3.6214
West too had complained to the audience that he had difficulty behind the stage because of its headdress .	-3.4939
" They sent me behind the stage .	-1.7510
You said : ' Do not go along with the hat ' .	-3.3713
You have angered me !	-2.0582
And then they say that I am in a place they put forth , " he said , according to the Washingtoner exile .	-6.7304
West continued : " Do you want to see the defiant place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman 's frenzy , because that means that you can not tell me what I should do , and you want the world to ?	-7.7134
Try it with love . ”	-1.3092
His comments were made at least twice by the audience with fines and the comedies of Saturday Night Live appeared to be moved , Variety reported and quoted a person in the words : “ The whole studio was dead . ”	-5.8826

Because obviously something went wrong for young men .	-2.1292

“ lies , lies , and even more lies lie , ” Waters informed Twitter in an opinion .	-4.4062
According to the information published , private addresses and telephone numbers of South Carolina Senators , along with the US Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both of them .	-4.9813
The information published on Thursday online , edited by an unknown person on the capitol hill during a hearing of the Senate about the charges of sexual misconduct against the candidate of the Supreme Court Brest Kavanaugh .	-6.0042
The data of the three senators was published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-2.0304
Conservative websites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the source of posts was associated with Waters 'office and reported the information of a member of Waters .	-4.2041
“ This unfounded accusation is totally wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continued .	-3.2244
“ The employees of my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – were in no way responsible for the fact that this information was suspended .	-4.6739
This indefensible claim is totally wrong and an absolute lie .	-4.6245
Water ’ s statement quickly led to criticism online , including by the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer .	-4.0659
“ The fact that the matter is settled is extremely tedious , ” he wrote butchers .	-5.5931
“ This suggests that she is not a member of Congress .	-3.5420
If someone is accused of doing something , he must not be angry .	-2.5168
They must not be successful .	-3.1190
They must not question the accused of the plaintiff .	-3.1577
They need to be calm and left . ”	-1.8469
Fleur seemed to compare Waters ’ response with the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused of critics of appearing angry during the Thursday hearing .	-4.5566
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who is running next to the sessed Water during the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.4335
“ Big , if true , ” he got dried .	-2.8885
In her statement , Waters said that her office " informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about fraudulent claims .	-2.9368
“ We will make sure that the perpetrators will be brought to account and continued for their actions , which have a destructive and dangerous effect on my staff . ”	-4.7558
Revension of " Johnny English - You live only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.4566
It is a tradition of looking for Andeurien in every new film with British tendency to Brexit , which seems to be applicable to this revisionism of Johnny English action Comedy-Spoof Franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-launched in 2011 with " Johnny English Rekor " .	-8.3045
Is the ironic self-sation of the mankind behind the new export opportunities of the nation ?	-5.7289
In any case , for the second time , the glorious , rubber-careful and incompetent Johnny English has been granted the license to reproach the things .	-6.8685
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims on Smoote-Glamour , has received a little clout , a syringer Mr. Bean and a gocks from this guy , and who has contributed a single touch to the signature of the firefighters during the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-8.7026
It is also based on travellers and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the television shows that are now forgotten , has always lost chaos .	-5.4611
There is one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English-Komödie .	-2.2651
I loved Johnny English , who is approaching a helicopter in a medieval armour , and the main rotor is quick to beat his helmet .	-4.2748
Atkinson 's talent for body komödie is visible , but the humor feels rather weak and superfluous , especially since the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission Impossible self-confident comedy as an ingredient .	-5.2352
The sense of humour is as if he is directed to children rather than adults , and for me the crazy mismas of Johnny English are not so ingenious and focused like Atkins Mr. Beam movies .	-5.6214
The everlasting premise is now that Britain is in great trouble .	-1.9996
A cyber hacker infested the highly secret British network of spies , and exposed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to the horror of the serving agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-5.3554
Emma Thompson is the last straw halm for a prime minister who is a pompous and countered personality and already suffers a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .	-7.2498
Their secret service consultants inform them that , as each individual active spy has been compromised , they have to pick someone out of the retirement .	-4.7648
And that means the great patchlaw Johnny English itself , who is today employed as a schoolmaster in a noble institution , but giving unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as a Undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy via Spionage .	-8.1071
English is brought back to Whitehall for an emergency hit , reunified with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , which is again played by Ben Miller .	-5.4264
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overtired , burschikos role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not entirely relevant .	-5.4374
So , the Batman and Robin of the Chaos at the Secret Service of Her Majesty are back in action and meet in Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Feme Fatale Ophelia Bulletiova .	-5.4317
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is risking a ban on the charismatic tech billionaire that claims to be able to solve the British computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-4.6531
English and Bough start their dysses of colourful Highjinks : As a waiter , they ignite a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board of Voltas luxury yachts ; and English solves pure anarchy as he tries to familiarize himself with a Virtual Reality headset with the interior of Voltas house .	-6.0616
For this last sequence , all the registers have been drawn , but so kindly and omitted they are reminiscent of children 's television .	-7.8459
That is fine .	-1.1630
And , as with the other Johnny English-Filmen , I could not resist thinking : can the British film industry , Rowan Atkinson , not give a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-6.2735
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week , for which five days are paid .	-1.9360
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party is considering a radical plan where British work only four days a week , but are paid for five .	-3.4206
According to reports , the party wants business leaders to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them an extra day .	-4.2471
Staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still make the same money home .	-4.2047
Sources said that the idea would be ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country for the benefit of workers .	-4.2111
The trade union congress has approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to make use of the changing economy .	-3.8541
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.2658
A four-day week is a goal that coincides with the party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of workers and the party ’ s overall industrial strategy , but this goal will not be achieved overnight .	-4.5386
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Greens promised a four-day working week during their campaign in 2017 .	-3.2508
However , the Labour Party is currently not supporting this push .	-4.1731
A spokesman for the Labour Party said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-3.0797
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Conference last week to concrete his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.2300
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to regain the power of ' hopeless directors ' and ' profit-making ' to utilities companies .	-4.0120
The shadow Chancellor 's plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not get their full share back , because a Labour Government could " deduct " due to alleged misconduct .	-6.5867
He also endorsed the plans of employees to train and create exclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private sector equity to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-6.0993
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” of whether FBI inquiries against Kavanaugh might change their mind .	-3.6860
The final vote on the appeal of the judge to the Supreme Court has been postponed by at least a week , owing to an ongoing FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , and raises the question of whether the investigation results of the FBI senators could lead to their support for Kavanaugh .	-6.1692
In an interview on Sunday , Scott Pelley , a correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could move them to change their mind .	-4.3350
Kennedy appeared in neatly as his colleague from South Carolina .	-4.9605
“ In any case , ” said Kennedy .	-1.9709
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.8025
I called him after it happened after this claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.4240
He was determined , objective , unequivocal . '	-1.9547
Graham 's voice , however , seemed to be carved in stone .	-2.8240
" I have an opinion about Brest Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb , " he said .	-3.7309
“ Dr. Ford , I don ’ t know what happened , but I know that Brent took the charge hard , ” he added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-5.5652
" No one they called could confirm it .	-2.7975
It was 36 years ago .	-0.8511

" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-2.1866
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-4.2112
At this year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival , tens of thousands of people will gather at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardiff B , and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the real goal of the event : ending extreme poverty by 2030 .	-5.0683
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of Global Poverty Projects , an international interest group aimed at fighting poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against them .	-3.9576
In order to get a free ticket for the event , the Konzerthaus had a whole range of tasks or actions , such as volunteering , an email to a world leader , a telephone call or another useful way of increasing the goal of combating poverty and raising awareness .	-6.7318
But how successful has Global Citizen been to achieve its goal with 12 remaining years ?	-3.3133
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way of persuading people to call for action , or simply another case of the so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel to be sent by signing an online petition or an online application , or by sending a tweet as if they would make a real difference ?	-6.4188
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , more than 19 million “ actions ” have been recorded by his supporters , who have pressed for a variety of purposes .	-4.4016
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-3.3304
In early 2018 , 390 employees and announcements from their actions were reported , at least $ 10 billion have already been disbursed or financed .	-4.6257
The group estimates that the funds allocated have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-2.9798
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to support Rwanda , with $ 35 million , to end malnutrition in the country after more than 4.700 tweets had been received by Global Citizen .	-6.3382
“ With support from the British government , donors , other state governments , and global Citizens like you , we can cause the social injustice of malnutrition one day ’ s history , ” the Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman declared the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 . the of are , , and are , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.0726
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom , which aimed to improve the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will achieve the financing of the project " Power of Nutrition " 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-5.2304
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website : “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-8.4807
Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.9832
Like the great civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed because we are more powerful together .	-3.6625
The stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monále will present this year 's event in New York , hosted by Deborra Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-8.9130
US could build a “ blockade ” through the Navy to impede Russian energy exports – Interior Secretary .	-3.3053
Washington can use its navy , if necessary , to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State , Ryan Zinke , is quoted by Washington .	-4.4678
Zinke argued that Russia ’ s involvement in Syria – especially when it comes to activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-4.5319
“ I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is this : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-4.6515
And , according to the officials , there are ways to avoid this .	-2.9869
“ The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that the sea routes are open and , if necessary , to block in order to ensure that its energy does not come onto the market , ” he said .	-5.3931
Zinke spoke to participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.0669
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , saying that they are actually the same .	-2.9791
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick-pony " with a fossil-fuel economy .	-4.5184
Comments come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquid gas to Europe and replace Russia , the far more favourable option for European consumers .	-4.7344
As a result , Trump ’ s Trump administration ’ s members – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to push Germany into a “ inappropriate ” North Stream 2 Pipeline One project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ captive . ”	-5.5733
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11-dollar Nord Stream 2 pipeline , which will double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters , is a purely economic project .	-3.6528
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply being driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.2046
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers , ” said Russia ’ s Minister for Energy Aleksandr Novak , following a meeting with US Secretary of Energy , Rick Perry , in Moscow in September .	-4.1436
The US position has provoked backlash from Germany , which has confirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.5802
Germany ’ s leading industrial organisation , the German Federation of Deutscher Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to refrain from EU energy policy and bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.3882

The Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignored decades of international law .	-3.2208

Lawyers continued to argue in the sentence that policies that refuse to enter immigrants hurt the US economy because it is more likely to become entrepreneurs and do “ necessary work . ”	-5.2313

US ambassador raises China “ bullying ” with propaganda propaganda propaganda propaganda .	-3.1800
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a quadruple display in a US newspaper on the mutual benefits of US-China trade , the US ambassador in Beijing suggested using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.6290
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily ’ s paid support in the China Daily register – the state with the most widely sold Iowa newspaper – after accused China of meddling in the US Congress elections of 6 November , which China .	-6.1825
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation that Beijing is trying to meddle in US elections is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-3.5129
While it is normal for foreign countries to turn ads to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are now engaged in an escalating trade war with multiple rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.6393
At an early stage of trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs should hit exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.5595
Terry Branstad , the American ambassador to China , and a former long-time governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing has violated American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-4.6493
China , wrote Branstad in an article in the Moines Register on Sunday , “ now emphatically operates this bullying by means of propaganda in our own free press .	-5.2789
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid ad in the Moines Register , China ’ s government takes advantage of the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and the press , ” wrote Branstad .	-4.2098
" By contrast , you will find only limited dissent in the Beijing streets of newspapers and see no real response to differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have to consider China ’ s disturbing economic development , given that the media are firmly in the hands of the Chinese Communist Party , ” he wrote .	-6.8628

The emotions were high , most Republicans have already indicated that they want to vote for him .	-2.4630
These things can not be traced , Grant Reed , professor of political science at Syracuse University 's Maxwell School , said on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-3.8170

“ The democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” Stu Rothenberg said , an impartial political analyst , the journalists .	-2.8252
“ People say that it has been rather advanced , that is true .	-4.0044

“ It is not just about the committee ’ s choice or the final vote , or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the substitute bank , but about how the Republicans handled it and how they treated it , ” said Guy Cecil , director of US priorities , a group that helps in the election of the Democrats , with the news station .	-7.6110
The Americans , however , are divided by Ford and Kavanaugh ’ s .	-2.9605

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt less valuable due to his sexuality .	-3.6592
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling that , because of his sexuality , he was suffering all - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-4.8729
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware of the fact that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-4.2143
In the first issue of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 , Lauren Lavane said he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.7996
He also said that victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important for him .	-2.2317
The regular presentation at the long-running show , Kristy Young , released several months due to an illness .	-4.5072
Daley joined Lavernes first program and said that he felt “ less value ” than the others , because “ society did not accept standing on men and women . ”	-5.2393
He said : “ So far , these feelings of the Wenger value and of the Gentiles gave me the power and strength that I needed to be successful . ”	-4.8961
He had to prove that he was “ something , ” he said , to let no one disappoint when he led from his sexual orientation .	-4.9111
The double-digit bronze medallinger has become a high-caliber LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to call for more countries to criminalise homosexuality .	-4.5605
He said he had spoken because he was fortunate enough to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give other ' hope ' .	-4.0640
Three times the world champion said that he was in love with a man who was in the hands of US filmmaker DuLance Black , who he met in 2013 , whom he was very surprised .	-6.2213
Daley married the Oskar winner , who is 20 years older than him , last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-4.6392
“ If so much is done during such a young years , ” he took part in the Olympic Games for 14 years , three years later his father died in cancer – or , according to him , it was difficult to find someone at the same age who experienced similar heights and depths .	-6.5466
The couple was born in June parents of a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley , and Daley said that his " full perspective " had changed .	-3.6845
“ Last year , for me , everything was to win a gold medal , ” he said .	-2.6604
“ But you know what is more important than Olympic gold .	-1.7810
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.6622
His son bears the name of his Robert father , who died in 2011 with a cancer test only 40 years after his .	-4.3049
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.6693
" I could not say to him : " You will not experience sitting in the first row , Dad ' , he said .	-3.8108
“ I thought his hand when his breathing was exposed .	-5.3737

The formweak Mickelson sat on the Ryder Cup Saturday at the bank .	-3.4965
American Phil Mickelson is going to set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he has to dramatically improve his form no sad milestone .	-4.4949
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event which takes place every two years , was set by Captain Jim Furyk for the Four Balls and Fourths on Saturday .	-4.8580
Instead of being at the centre of events , as is so often the case for the US , the five-time majority declared his day between fire and exercise rounds on the golf course , in the hope of overcoming its depth .	-6.6516
The 48-year-old , even at the peak of his career , is never the most straightest driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly penalises misses .	-6.9649
And as if the place alone would not be challenging enough , Mickelson meets all four matches in the ninth match on Sunday on the British Open Champion , Francesco Molinari , who won this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-5.9929
If the Americans have four points behind when starting the 12 individual games and have a hot start , Mickelson 's match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.5827
Furyk expressed his trust in his man ; what else left him .	-4.8257
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-4.4904
“ He has a lot of confidence in him . , , , , and , , etc , , and . , , , , , , ,	-5.1965
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-2.9418
I probably would not have thought he is playing two games .	-2.6320
I wanted to see more , but it has now emerged and that is the way in which we felt we had to address it .	-6.3630
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.1760
So far , Nick Faldo is holding the record on most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which will Mickelson on Sunday .	-4.9582
This could mark the end of a Ryder ’ s cut-career , which has never reached the heights of his individual record .	-5.8996
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times less .	-5.6009
" He is fun , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to talk to people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.9747
I think the younger players had fun this week to measure with him , that was nice looking . ”	-5.0479
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.1573
The European Captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a major advance can soon be lost .	-4.8892
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a major advance in the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup can quickly become a inconvenient kick .	-5.1275
The Danish debuted in 1997 in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only slightly above the target line and gained 13 <unk> with a shallow margin of 14 <unk> to 13 .	-6.9249
" It is worth remembering that one was led in Valderrama ; we had a big lead in Brooklyn where we lost .	-23.5196
History will show me and all in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.5573
You will be absolutely silent tomorrow .	-2.0805
Go out there and do the right things .	-0.9445
It is only past when the items on the table are displayed .	-3.4026
Our goal is to win this Cup and we concentrate on that .	-2.9246
I have always said that I believe in the 12 players in our team , but we have a strong opponent to do the best players in the world . ”	-3.3156
As his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be premature here .	-4.0965
Tomorrow is also a day .	-0.9551
Tomorrow the personal performances will come , and that is another thing .	-3.3197
It ’ s great to be out there with a partner when things are going well , but if you are out there , your skills as a golf player will be tested on the whole .	-5.6188
This is the message you have to convey to the players : get the best out tomorrow .	-3.6914
Now you go over to your partner and you have to make full use of it . ”	-4.9979
Unlike Björn , the opposing party Jim Furyk will strive to better off his players individually than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who made three out of four points .	-6.2136
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , when he was part of the Victory Team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team achieved the “ miracle of Mediaclose ” .	-6.7239
" I remember every word , " he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players in the last day .	-4.7880
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get rid of them as soon as possible in Brooklyn , in media contact .	-5.0460
For the first time , if a self-dynamic has developed , the pressure on the medium scale is intense .	-6.7767
We have built our map accordingly and got the boys as tough as we felt , you know that we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.2015
Thomas should play a leading role with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European in the top places in the ranking , the counterstrike against Rory McIlroy .	-5.2724
I put this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole path " , says Bjorn about its selection .	-3.8631
Restore the timetable for Germany ’ s new war ship	-3.0418
The German Marine ’ s latest naval attack should have been launched in 2014 to replace the years of full-blown Cold War warships , but , owing to defective systems and escalating costs , local media reports will now take at least until next year .	-8.4711
The commissioning of the “ Rheinland-Pfalz ” , the flagship vessel of the brand new conglomerates of Baden-Württemberg ’ s Baden-Wuerttemberg class , has now been moved to the first half of 2019 , so the newspaper “ Time ” calls on a military spokesperson .	-6.8275
The Navy should have been in operation in 2014 , but serious problems after its first delivery were weighed down the ambitious project .	-4.5212
The four ships ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older ones of the Bremen-class .	-3.9102
It is assumed that they have a powerful canon , a series of air defense and ship missiles , and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-5.1268
Another important advantage is longer maintenance interval : the latest amats should be able to use up to two years without running the home port .	-5.4783
However , the highly modern warships that Germany is supposed to facilitate a project of power in overseas will already be obsolete by the constant delays when they are finally being put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ Time ” indicates .	-7.4041
The unfortunate F125-Fregatte made headlines last year , when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.4278
This was the first time that the nave returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery .	-4.3185
There was little known about the reasons for the return of ships ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware ” that would make the war ship useless in combat operations .	-5.4463
The first volume of this work was the 1890s .	-10.5294
It was also apparent that the vessel was in a considerable overweight , which would reduce performance and make it more difficult for the marine to be upgraded in future .	-8.5373
It is assumed that the 7,000 tonnage “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by Germans in World War II .	-3.2148
In addition to incorrect hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including training of the crew - is .	-4.5245
Instead of the € 2.2 billion initially estimated , the cost now seems to have reached the staggering figure of EUR 3.1 billion ( some $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.9416
The problems of the latest ferrets are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is dwindling .	-4.8657
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Committee on Defence , admitted that the war fleet does indeed “ start operational ships . ”	-5.8538
The officer said that the problem had grown asleep in the course of time , as old ships were left out of service without any replacement for it .	-6.5010
He complained that no of Baden-Württemberg swimming pools were served by the Navy .	-6.2046
The National Trust covers the secret life of Fledermäumen .	-4.6519
New research on a farm in the Highlands of Scotland will try to find out how Fledermuse use the countryside for food search .	-6.3561
It is hoped that this will provide new insights into the behaviours of unique flowing mammals , which will provide guidance for future measures to protect animals .	-6.2567
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed in common with Sopran-Ppisten and brown langohren and Daugton Fledermäden in the Inverdewe Gardens in western Ross .	-6.5900
Special receptors are placed at the main points of the accommodation in order to follow fledgemarsayers throughout the entire season .	-6.7738

Rob Dewar , a National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) conservation advisor , hopes to find out what areas of life are most important for the bats and how they are used by the respective species .	-6.3203
This information will help to determine the advantages of living space management , such as bending and forestry for bats and other related species .	-5.8988
In Scotland and the whole of the United Kingdom , we have seen a sharp decline in the last hundred years .	-4.2795
They are threatened by building work that affects their sleeping places and the loss of living space .	-3.8459
Wind power plants and lighting may also pose a risk , as well as fly vessels and some chemical treatment of building materials .	-6.1385
Bats are not blind .	-2.2328
Appropriately for their late-night hunting activities , the ears are more useful to the prey species than the eyes .	-8.8841
They use a sophisticated Echo positioning technology to locate errors and obstacles in their journey .	-3.9647
The NTS , which is responsible for managing more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , is taking the bats very seriously .	-4.6543
There are ten trained experts who regularly conduct surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes rescue them .	-5.5330
Even Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated Fledermash reservation in the Threaded estate in Dumfries and Galloway , hosting eight of the ten Scottish Fledermasons . the of are , , and , and , , and .	-8.7952
According to managed David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-3.7243
“ Here in Threave we have a great area of flavour . ”	-4.4986
" We have old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.7618
But there is still a lot of unknowing about bats and the work we do here and elsewhere helps us better understand what they need to live . ”	-5.7622
He stresses that before maintenance works in buildings , it is important to check whether bats are there and , according to this , it is possible for a single bed of parent to be destroyed by up to 400 females and boys – a whole local population to be wiped out .	-10.1292
Bats are protected ; they are forbidden to kill , harass , or disturb and destroy their sleeping places .	-3.9696
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish staff at the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.1508
She said : “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-3.5782
Ronaldo has rapes when lawyers sue the German magazine .	-2.8349
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and says that people want to " promote themselves " by using their names .	-3.8117
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-2.7283
The storm from Portugal and Juventus was accused of being raped an American woman in 2009 called Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas .	-4.6186
He then paid 375 dollars to keep silent about the incident , reported Der Spiegel on Friday .	-2.7917
Hours after allegations have been reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an Instagram live-video rebuked his 142 million torture reports as “ fake news . ”	-4.5675
No , no , no , no .	-1.0340
What they say today , Face News , ” said the fifth Ballon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-3.2044
" You want to apply yourself by using my name .	-1.3541
“ That is normal .	-1.4853
They want to draw attention when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-3.5667
I ’ m a happy person , and all is good , ” the player added a smile .	-3.8737
Ronaldos lawyers are making a complaint about the “ Der Spiegel ” magazine because of the allegations ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ an undue reporting of suspicions in the area of privacy . ”	-5.0889
author Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for " intangible damage in the amount of the seriousness of the injury that is probably one of the most serious infringement of the personality rights in recent years " .	-5.8354
The alleged incident should have entered a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.3350
According to documents submitted to the district court of Clark County in the US state , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player 's room in a night club , where he rescued them in the kingdom .	-7.5183
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to the knees after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ too 99 % ” a “ good guy ” that was abandoned by “ one percent . ”	-5.6264
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was agreed .	-2.4180
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and made photographs of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had ' fear of retaliation ' and worried about being " publicly humiliated " .	-5.1422
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid because it is still traumatised by the alleged incident .	-4.9677
Ronaldo was about to change to Real Madrid United at the time of the alleged attack and moved to Italy with a € 100 million deal this summer .	-5.7278
Brexit : Britain would forever regret losing car manufacturers	-2.3632
“ The United Kingdom would regret it to be living in life if , after Brexit , it lost its position as the world ’ s leading automobile manufacturer , ” Minister Greg Clark said .	-6.6830
He added that it is ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production in their factory in Burnaton , near Derby , if major Britons leave the EU without a deal .	-5.1514
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.7893
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the consequences of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.8993
The plant in Burnanton , which manufactures the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.7951
“ If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that our work is going to stop production , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO at Toyota in Burnaston .	-5.4812
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the methods of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.3197
For example , BMW has already announced that its work in Oxford after Brexit will be closed for a month .	-2.8674
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers are saying about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no de Brexit ' .	-4.5767
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on manufacturing that is required , i.e. , the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for special products .	-6.5201
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays on the border which , according to industry figures , may lead to supply shortages and partial scarcity .	-5.0669
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of the stock in its plant in Derbyshire , the company said , and thus stop production .	-3.8701
Mr Clark said that Teresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “ calibrated to avoid such border controls . ”	-3.8874
We need a deal , we want the best deal , which not only enables us to succeed today , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said the BBC Radio 4 programme today .	-5.3495
“ The reference not only from Toyota , but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue what a very successful series of supply chains have become . ”	-5.0448
Toyota did not specify how long the production stop could take , but warned that the cost increase could in the long term suffer the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-7.1067
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives and has been in Burnaston for 24 years , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ I ’ m experience that jobs are lost for ever . ”	-5.3021
A spokesperson said : ' We have presented a clear and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-3.7042
Trump ’ s meeting with Rosenstein may be postponed , the White House says	-4.2372
Donald Trump ’ s high-profile meeting with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be " postponed another week " because the fight for the Supreme Court candidate , Brent Kavanaugh , announced the White House on Sunday .	-5.6146
Rosenstein supervised the work of Special Representative Robert Mueller , who investigates Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible impediment of justice by the president .	-4.0237
Whether Trump will or not become the Deputy Attorney General , thereby jeopardising the independence of Müller , Washington has put a lot of gossip for months .	-4.1075
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had been discussing wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and making it possible to remove the president ’ s 25th Amendment .	-4.7694
Rosenstein refused to comment .	-1.6862
But last Monday , he went to the White House , while reports were hailed that he was close to resignation .	-4.1867
Instead , a meeting with Trump at the time of the United Nations in New York was announced on Thursday .	-2.3467
Trump said that he would not want to fire Rosenstein , but the sitting was then delayed to avoid a clash with the hearing of the Senate ’ s Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , accused of sexual misconduct .	-4.3693
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI-examination of the claims against Kavanaugh , and delayed a full senatorial period .	-4.3267
Donald Trump ’ s press secretary Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-1.9158
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A date for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I went back another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-6.1216
But we will see and I keep the press informed . '	-2.5517
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.2843
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.8832
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not a distraction on TV reporters who behave like self-actors , but he also said : ' I will not oppose them in the gallery ' .	-7.3710
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.8267
" The President raises more questions and answers than any President before him , " said she and added without any evidence : " We have looked at these figures . "	-6.1826
Writings will still take place , said Sanders , but the press should have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States the questions directly , that is infinitely better than speaking to her .	-5.6428
We are trying to do much of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and a press talk will be replaced if you can speak to the President of the United States itself . ”	-4.8187
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with his attending dignitaries .	-3.4244
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-0.8078
In New York , the President might have shown this week why by making a freestanding and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-4.1454
Brexit fears : Secretary of Health ’ s letter to EU workers in NHS Scotland	-2.8957
Health Minister has written to EU employees in Scotland ’ s NHS to be grateful to the country and to the wish that they will remain after Brexit .	-5.6070
The honourable Member of the Scottish Parliament , Jane Freeman , wrote her letter less than six months before Britain left the EU .	-3.5490
The Scottish Government has agreed to accept the costs of the agreed status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public service .	-3.3161
In her writing , Mrs Freeman wrote : “ During the summer , negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU on exit were continued , along with expected decisions in the autumn .	-3.6489

Milchpumping , where mothers are compared to cows , has led to controversial online discussions .	-3.6999
A dairy pumpkin company has provoked much controversy on the online discussion because of an ad in which breastfeeding mothers are compared with melts .	-6.9455
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " first silent and portable milk pump " , Elvie ’ s consumer tech company published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms are offered with this new pump .	-5.9466
Four real mothers are dancing in a haunting middle of cows into a number with the following song text : " Yes , I 'm shouting , but you see no cock " and " If you have not noticed that there are no Euters , they are my breasts " .	-7.9275
The slogan goes on : " Pump off , pump , I add the babies , pump off , pump , pump off , pump , pump , I smelt my ladies " .	-6.1405
However , the ad published on the company 's Facebook page has caused controversy online .	-2.4665
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from the spectators , many of whom say that it highlights the " terror " of the dairy economy .	-4.7186
" It is a very bad decision to promote cows for this product " .	-2.6301

Another commented : " intelligible to mother and baby .	-4.5312

Another commented : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who are pumping pumps ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-4.5280
This is not advertising which praises or assesses the dairy industry .	-3.7974
At the end of the video , the group of women revealed that they have all taken care of the introspective pumps in their BHs .	-5.1066
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women pumping milk say they feel like cows .	-3.0592
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely silent , has no wires or hoses and keeps fit into a silent H , allowing women to move , keep their babies and even go to pumps .	-6.2549
Ana Balarin , Partner in and ECD commented at Mother : " The Elwell Pump is such a revolutionary product that has earned a bold and provocative market launch .	-5.0949

Hundreds of migrants ' children moved quietly into a camp on the Texas border .	-3.5602
The number of children imprisoned with an immigrant background increased , even though monthly border crossings remain relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and politics made it more difficult to identify sponsors for children .	-4.8537
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants , and fear that they will risk being expelled from the country when they are committed to a child .	-3.3027
The risk rose in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their budgets would have to provide fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-3.7698
Last week , Matthew Allingz , a senior official within the Agency for Immigration and Customer Enforcement , said before Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-4.6275
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.3869
" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal extrajudicial .	-4.7490
" So we continue to follow these people " , said Aldinence .	-4.5602

The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they are being detained or deported , which may lead to violent outbreaks or flood attempts .	-4.6039
Advocates said that these concerns are increased in a larger body like Tornillo , where signs that a child has to fight are more likely to be overlooked by size .	-4.8156
They added that moving children to the tent town , without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to pass away from friends , could make a dream worse with which many are already fighting .	-4.7490

The US has roughly 2,000 troops in Syria ; mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-2.9705
France has deployed more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-ravaged country .	-2.3848
On the question of refugees , Mouse said that the conditions for return were correct , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears , ” which led refugees to keep away .	-4.8801
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return , ” says Moualem .	-3.7205
“ You politicise a purely humanitarian question . ”	-1.9013
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there can only be reconstruction aid to Syria if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition was about an end to the war .	-4.7421
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel building , Idlib , was able to advance political talks .	-4.0684
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-3.3160
The Mouale-stressed , however , that the agreement “ clear time ” has been signed , and it hope that the military action will be directed against jihadists , among other things against fighters from the Nusra line , which will be “ eliminated . ”	-8.2137
