The oldest official card in Munich encourages exciting stories to come .	-2.9612
It 's annoying that maps are not up-to-date .	-4.8822
Everyone who had to get excited about this , because the Auto Navi opened a green meadow instead of a change road .	-5.6591
The historical maps of the German German Federal Government , Bavaria 's regional maps , are far from the point of view - but that is precisely why they are . are and are . , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.6318
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-2.4804
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the nineteenth century in the purported area of the Munich-based magistracy .	-6.5783
The Bayern-Atlas is a Flickr teppich , one that cannot be recognized as such .	-5.8912
In the big map , more detailed maps were created for cities and communities , so-called positions sheets .	-5.8645
In 1810 and 1864 the Bayerische Measuring Administration was established .	-8.6190
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.4542
Since the spring of 1800 , the French army occupied Bavaria during the second coalition war with Austria .	-3.9076
Napoleon wished to have an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographical reception of Bavaria for military purposes , of course .	-4.5024
Although the French troops finally overstepped the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , today ’ s neighbors created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern card .	-5.3835
The project was initiated by the German Ministry of Education and Research and Development .	-7.8891
The original position sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the other on the website of the Bayerischer Landeslibrary .	-3.8941
The comparison used in the past and today is the most impressive example of the country ’ .	-4.6039
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.6569
An example of this is Untersendling , which is still relatively isolated on the map of 1856 .	-3.4439
Sendling was admitted as Munich 's quarter 21 years after drawing up the map , i.e. 1877 .	-6.3180
Today is Untersendling in the middle of the city .	-1.7885
The houses of Untersendllings are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganeserstraße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganeser in 1878 , a leader of the insurgency of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-5.4781
Where the Westpark is today , you can see nothing as an area - at first glance : there is a smaller section map with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten torches from the so-called " Urzuka " which derived the property tax .	-9.2083
Small plots no longer show farmers there - but small growths of the " land in sun " plant .	-5.7600
A large green area is found north of Untersendling .	-2.9824
Terezienwiese , the site of the octoberfest since 1810 , was actually still a meadow in the 19th century - and not a concrete remains .	-6.1242
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.5115
In the Urpositioning sheet , in the area of today 's Au-Haidhausen district , you can read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " In Lüzen " - but also in large letters " Irene Anstalt " .	-6.7917
Yes , here at the Auerfeldstrasse people once disappeared with madness .	-5.0552
There , 1858 / 59 , the Munich district Irenanstalt was born on the Auof Lüin .	-7.6062
From 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought up in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II .	-4.1428
" He was progressive for his time , for example , ending the labels of so-called deceit .	-3.2340
In addition , he has forbidden the staff to use violence against the occupants " , says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition with the institutions .	-6.0970
For 280 patients was first place , later extended to 500 places .	-3.5129
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the krirrenstallt in Haar 1905 .	-4.7626
The Isar-Ampeer-Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychopharmacies , has been located there since 2006 .	-5.9206
On the premises of the former Auer Anstalt , young people will now meet at the Munich Salesianum .	-4.4873
The order bought the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-4.3263
To the west is the football pitch of TSV München East , to the east of the residences dating back to the 1980s .	-5.0777
In 2015 , Casa Don Bosco , a child ’ s house , was built in an architectural reference to the building of the maze of the maze of the foreground , which was destroyed in World War II at bomb attacks .	-9.2947
Marienplatz was listed as " Main Square " in 1856 , which was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.3471
The Second World War also brought a crucial change in the heart of Munich .	-3.2973
Allies ' bombs in December 1944 carry plenty of holes in the city centre .	-4.1967
A big still remained - at the Marienhof .	-4.0375
The English Institute , small business houses , and a Middle Ages tombs were once at the Marienhhof , where these days the preparatory work and on 5 April 2017 were carried out for the second S-tamms-train .	-8.6450
With the Schieregler you can compare the old Munich card with today 's air image - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.4670
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes Travel Alert to Missouri	-6.3449
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors issued a warning for coloured people traveling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-3.9187
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force until August 28 , 2017 , calls Afro-American travellers , visitors and Missouri to pay special attention to travel through the State of Missouri and exercise extreme caution , as a number of dubious , racist events have recently occurred in the state and are recorded here " , in the opinion of the group .	-7.6984
A recent passed law by Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to gain discriminations , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state that are disproportionately aimed at minorities , led the group to issue the warning of travel , said NAACP .	-6.9630
" You have violations of civil rights that occur people .	-2.4389
They are detained , beaten or killed because of their skin colour , " said the President of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-4.2640
" We hear complaints at such a frequency that we have not yet heard . "	-3.1068
It is the first such warning that the US government has issued .	-2.6008
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-3.1479
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no more gas during his trip by the state and was arrested by the police of Missouri without being accused of any crime .	-5.0565
The Council also points to a recent report by the Attorney General of Missouri , which shows that black drivers are more often than white in the state .	-4.3926
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-3.6626
" People need to be prepared to bring in foot or let the relatives know that they are traveling by the state . "	-5.2398
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s Hassan Ban Plan , which included the state in the number of such injuries to the 16th place of the .	-5.3727
Travel warning is also an answer to a new law on Missouri , which would make it more difficult to sue a company because of housing or employment discrimination .	-3.2857
Before that , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings in Texas and Arizona after the States had passed immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigration violations , which in the opinion of the ACLU will contribute to further racial profiling .	-6.1686
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to specific laws and trends within the US .	-3.6805
Weimar project is elementary .	-2.4393
The Fisherbacher Weidevaun-project is a success project and will continue next year .	-4.4065
Members of the CDG , Peter White and Kordula Kovac , have given themselves a picture on the spot .	-5.6083
At the Swedish family 's Rechtsgrabenhof , representatives of the Fischbacher CDU local assembly met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .	-6.8730
Markus Schwendemann initially gave some insights into his operation in which he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses in five apartments guests .	-7.2626
The black forest milk is for him the indiscriminate distribution path for the milk of his cows , Schwendemann .	-4.4412
On the table of the guests there is only a regional one .	-3.6108
Since he is also the leader of the BLHV-president of Fischbach , he called the Weimar project as " basic important " .	-6.2353
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas .	-1.7519
The land surface area for a lot of work , a lot has to be done with the engine sensor .	-6.3063
" We are dealing with the conditions and the topography , " said Schwendemann .	-3.7197
In 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it did not lead to a organic operation .	-5.3775
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that " The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weimar project and is pleased with the leadership support " .	-5.2395
In the event of costs of 3000 to 4000 Euros per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-3.9780
We hope that this could lead to the depletion of land for a long time .	-6.4627
" The biggest treasure that we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on their operation , " the mayor emphasized .	-5.2195
Farmers are often in the criticism because of promotion	-3.3311
In 2013 a total of 25 par cells were protected by 11 participants .	-4.2326
It is therefore 40 hectares that cannot be accounted for until at least 2023 .	-5.2661
Of the total cost of € 71 500 , half was promoted via Leader , while the town of Fischbach was a quarter .	-6.5460
This means that farmers have remained 12 610 euros , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of Weimar .	-5.1024
" The great advantage is the longevity of the fences , " explained Swendemann .	-3.1603
Kordula Kovac emphasized : " You do a good job without farmers and farmers there 's no problem " .	-4.9917
Peter White was also noted : " Here the best food is produced " .	-2.8747
The Landscape Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg provides government support for pastures .	-3.1608
The objective is to keep the black forest open .	-2.1210
A subsidy scheme referred to by LPR is required .	-3.1986
In addition , the area under consideration must not be a slow-moving area ( hemication over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-11.0256
For the Fisherbacher Weidevazunproject in 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 parcels who want to build about about 16 kilometres of fence is currently under way .	-10.3787
The open surface is 35 hectares and costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-4.6514
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.8955
Now the White House of Trump is adopting the Statute for Freedom	-4.5319
The safest sign of regime change is to attack the statues when they begin . are , , and , and , , , , , , , and , , , and , , and , , , ,	-5.7622
Americans like everyone else , so the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein on Baghdad ’ s Firm in 2003 .	-4.9486
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration with the status of freedom .	-4.3331
To stay fair , Miller did not seize the statue itself .	-2.5440
A horde of boat owners and liberty-beekeepers would have got him drunk if he had done .	-4.6098
But he took on their importance , and in particular the importance that she was given when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial .	-7.5586
When Miller Acosta cried , " I do not want to go into a complete dinner on history , but the status of freedom is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world desires .	-5.6943
The poem you refer to , which was added later , rather than being part of the original Statute for Freedom . '	-3.1488
Miller is technically correct , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-2.7952
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your mothers , your poor , / your besieged masses , looking for free to breathe , / the waste of your rich coasts . "	-6.8683
There was never a time when the " sliding waste " was better on our screens .	-3.5364
Miller did not commit himself in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-3.5957
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America .	-3.4130
Lazarus - and their friends who sought to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they took a highly political action .	-4.7616
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republican , by showing in a classical painting painting the female embodiment of freedom .	-4.6151
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she received a voice .	-2.9508
And it gives itself a quite different name : Mother of exilants .	-4.3654
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-1.9668
And just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .	-3.8837
The Great Shrine of Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of Deceier for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the status of freedom is not an invitation to anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative who brought the American flame into the ravaged world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-7.5609
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-1.9524
The torch should not search for the way into the United States . '	-2.7399
It is rather unusual to see Limbaugh here .	-5.9401
The significance of the statue is definitely a question of the position of perception .	-2.8078
The great imaginative actions of Lazarus were to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the deck of ships .	-5.1319
In the true sense , it is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-5.6859
Her statue tells them the words of hope and will that they must hear .	-3.3342
Of course , that is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge .	-3.4738
Their torch should not search out the way , but ignite the hatred that is its only source of power .	-3.5269
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black defeats Scottish members of the UK team .	-2.7042
Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scots belong to the UK team .	-3.3195
The director of the UK 's lightweight athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-year-old Scottish quota in the world championship " will make a massive contribution to the team " .	-5.2532
A record number of Scottish athletes have been selected for London 2017 , which starts Friday .	-2.8393
Black believes that ' something particularly developed in Scotland ' and that the UK 's athletics must learn something from it .	-4.6523
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to do it until we find out " said Black .	-5.1108
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.3532
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.8109
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2965
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.1252
Whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.6812
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete on the 5,000 m route against Sir Mo Farah , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team .	-5.7668
" Eilidh is fairly modest .	-1.3032
Your chapter 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.6733
" A number of athletes , regardless of whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and highly motivated . were , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.2523
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought , of course , was great . "	-4.7421
The Commonwen-Silvermedille-speaking woman , who will encounter at their fifth world championships with the 400m hurdles , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-6.3580
Scotland 's best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.4214
The Mittelgeber Muir is taking this approach and has drawn up five British and two European records last year .	-6.1272
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .	-3.3499
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1.500 metres , is another Scotsman to watch the victory of the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games after a great season .	-4.5738
Doyle reminds her of her first world championships , when the only other Scottish team was Lee McConnell .	-4.3168
Mannheim 's experts say that they are " enormously proud " of the fact that many of their compatriots are not just team members , but in some cases also in the medals and finals .	-5.8748
" The special thing about team-related updates is that it was chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , makes it very special for me " , she adds .	-5.3370
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.9874
It shows just how far we have come .	-1.9319
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podium .	-4.5984
As regards my intervention as a chapter ?	-2.8940
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.5215
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a Home World Cup .	-3.6983
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to benefit from being back in the Olympic stadium .	-3.8103
I get a second chance to go out and compete there , and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.0465
Block critics on Facebook : Don ’ t hold you to a public office if you cannot stand asleep voters .	-5.2851
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.9002
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to swallow him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-3.1608
He refused criticism , assured .	-2.6103
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.1352
After all , in 1783 , Washington said : ' freedom of speech can be taken away - and , dumb and dumb , we are going to slaughter like sheep ' .	-3.9187
That brings me to Maryland 's Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.5102
Howan employees have blocked and deleted contributions from at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .	-3.4419
And the American Civil Civils Union seized him so early this week .	-5.9324
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.1128
" It is just Facebook , " said many people .	-1.7580
But it is important .	-0.9069
And it is especially important when it is a guy like Hogan .	-2.7783
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is remarkably popular .	-1.6896
He has the second-highest approval of the nation ’ s 50 Governor .	-3.0077
Hogan is not a reactionary heathead .	-1.8164
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and strict adherence to the principles .	-3.3435
He was also very skilful to use Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters , playing his reckless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-5.4005
That is why blocking people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum that is called officially and is unnecessary and dangerous by people who are paid with public tax dollars .	-6.5309
In an interview with The Washington Post , Howan Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking comments was nothing more than moderating .	-3.6375
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hackers who break the whiff online .	-4.5710
The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.4308
And these are only true people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , not trolls .	-2.9479
They all said that their comments were respectful , respectful and not profane .	-2.4580
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and called in Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-4.0793
The lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not harassed , but she asked for hate crimes .	-5.3056
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the news " The Post " .	-3.0453
" I do not value this idea even if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some people are rather disrespected as a so-called collective effort and are not recognised as a large group of affected citizens .	-7.5986
What the people of the governor called the " concentrated spam attack " would most likely call " attention " to others .	-5.5717
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-3.7983
It is far more cleaner than in previous times if we had done the same thing that employees were sent to gather and silence newspapers with critical strands , to burn or to burn demonstrators .	-6.7774
But that is precisely what is happening in digital format .	-2.7863
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for evading Facebook and other social media .	-3.1201
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter network .	-1.7486
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-1.7810
The chairman of the board of supervisors of Loudoun County injured the First Amendment , US president James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when they named a voter from their Facebook page .	-4.8451
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.7547
That should not be so difficult .	-2.0627
At the moment in Washington , the time of affordable ports had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.4448
The number of newspapers varies between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters of letters appealed to his leadership .	-3.9716
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.0791
The people who used pseudonyme such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-4.3923
Petitions , critical of his position on the Amity , Trade , and shipping with the United Kingdom , have overwhelming office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project ’ s Online Papers .	-5.6172
But he did not silenced it .	-1.5150
Freedom of speech , disagreement , and discord belong to the basis of our nation .	-3.4231
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.8105

Less lung cancer killed by passive smoking	-3.9291
In the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking .	-4.6907
This result is a study by scientists of the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKIP ) .	-3.8240
" According to our estimates , 167 cases of lung cancer are caused by passive smoking , " said Professor Heiko Becher .	-2.9094
He used his own study on the subject of 1994 .	-5.4802
At that time there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking every year in Germany .	-3.9058

In the field of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of talk about underground design , which is not included in plans .	-6.9858
The traffic which frequently hinders construction works is a major problem for the Stumpp construction force .	-5.2089

Papua is Indonesia 's poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.1445
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland .	-1.3902
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is only 60 miles away from Paniai , a high landlord in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-4.8188
In 2015 alone , Freeport has lost $ 3.1 billion of gold and copper .	-2.7917
Papua also has an estimated USD 78 billion worth of wood resources .	-1.9968
This wealth , however , is a source of misery for the Papua , which ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military remains a prime presence .	-4.1189
An investigation in 2005 at the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost $ 20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-4.0117

On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were out there , and sang Christmas days before a fire in Enarochi , when two Indonesian soldiers roamed through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-6.1353
The elusive children told them that they should take up their headlights .	-3.6171
One of the soldiers took inspiration from their sound , and later came back with four soldiers , according to the local Pastor Yassdt Tebai .	-4.8598
The soldiers who had drunk went hunting and swallow the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-3.6967
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.5720

They wore ceremonial hunting bows and led the Waiti dance - continuously in circle and imitating a bird - of Papuas Mee Pago tamm .	-5.3591
Some demonstrators began to smuggle stones on police and military posts .	-3.1084
When the mood was inflamed , the soldier was sent a command over an internal radio : " If the masses do more than three times resistance , they shoot them dead " , it is said in an official TIME document that has not been released to the local media .	-6.3864
Yeremias Kayname , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto Quarter of Enarochi , saw the threat of danger and called for rest and demanded the amount to return home .	-5.8747
Nobody was listening in the mood .	-1.3144
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left handjoint , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colourful wooden house .	-4.6906
Kayname still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-3.2812
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " it adds .	-2.2651
The native man Alfisus Youw was hit three times , so his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-4.7467

" I saw that he was dead ... I forsaken him " .	-2.2754
The chief inspector of the Papua police , Yotje Mende , said reporters that his officers would only " secure their station " because they were attacked .	-4.7213

Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historical human rights violations .	-2.6752
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.4129
" Most of the injuries occurred a long time ago .	-2.4385
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000 ’ s .	-1.8892
The point is that we have committed ourselves to dealing with these infringements , but there are processes that must be passed , " he said .	-3.5060
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME on 5 June , in Jakarta , saying that he did not have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.5219
Instead , ' will all be regulated by law ' , he said .	-3.2986
Wiranto , who charged the UN for crimes against humanity , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor ’ s bloody 1999 vote of independence , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua , including the Paniai case .	-4.9197
The families of the Paniai victims opposed such claims with fierce disbelief .	-5.0662
" I have been interviewer four times over the past three years , but there was no progress , " Yohanes says .	-3.7602

His brother Yaobus repeated the view that people in Paniai fear to discuss the incident .	-3.3557
He said that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-1.9323

On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighbourhood Deiyai .	-2.7075
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-2.9648
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-3.4877
Locked villagers were protesting against the company ’ s location office .	-4.0056
The police said that villagers were piling stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-3.0675
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot and killed a crowd .	-4.2411
" We were so in panic , we fear that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Domingg Badii , who lives near the hospital and was witness , as the injured were quickly admitted here , so the TIME .	-5.7226
" I hid in my house two days ' .	-1.8880
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers involved to hold hold hold to account and to withdraw the region ’ s mobile brigades .	-3.9414
Paniai has always been a disgrace to the Indonesian Government .	-2.5703
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the discontent of tribal people , Moni , Dani and Damal , living in the green highlands of Papua .	-4.8793
Many of them joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by embracing sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers .	-7.2454
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Taius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-3.2339
In response to this , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and have been arbitrarily arrested , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-4.1263
Some never dive again .	-2.2904
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as a " tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.2108
Poverty reinforces discontent .	-1.7022
The little rice that is sold in Enarochi is too expensive for locals .	-2.6507
Bread is just as out of reach .	-2.2247
The people here grow everything they eat : especially Nota and Fruits and Sheet vegetables .	-4.3994
Agriculture is the responsibility of women who can process four or five boxes of sweeteners .	-4.3874
They keep the majority of the family ’ s harvest , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.7783
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-2.0857
Over time , economic inequalities between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants have grown in greater numbers since the launch of new routes to the Nabucco airport .	-4.4282
The few jobs in the region usually go to better educated and prosperous migrants .	-3.1273
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills necessary to make their own businesses competitive .	-3.5645
" The young people are not interested in remaining in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here " , says John Gobai , Chairman of the Board of Directors of Paniai .	-3.8070
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-2.8827
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain tense .	-2.1579
Earlier this year , French journalists , Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp , were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , even though they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.7455
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowi ’ s campaign promises to lift restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-3.5844
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's uncontroversial provinces of Papua and Westpapua : visa refusal and black list , " he said in a statement .	-4.1681
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian government remains largely limited to Papua 's immediate neighbors .	-3.1417
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshans , and the Salomon Islands - demanded that the UN Human Rights Council investigate the ' various and widespread infringements ' in Papua , including Paniai leei .	-5.2715
These same countries have historically supported OPM .	-2.0930
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Arrmanatha Nasir , rebuked the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-5.1850
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.6403
As an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights activist , Kees Van Baar , Jayapura , visited on 4 May , the locals slashed their silence and forced him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also participated in the meeting , but wishes to remain anonymous .	-6.2450
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote again for Jokowi .	-2.8973
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in Paniai shisses , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council .	-5.1134
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniani people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor educational and health services .	-2.9219
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , see their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he has to pay back .	-4.5072
" You do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.5951
Despite the threats and intimidations , families of the Paniai army victims carried out a final symbolic act of comfort : the body of a victim was buried on a terrain precisely opposite the police and the military station .	-6.5982
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.7895
" A member of our family was killed " , says Yacbus with sweet head .	-2.9714

Fire capture the Torch 'Wollcratzer of Dubai for the second time .	-4.4732
A fire arrived in one of the world ’ s highest residential towers in Dubai on Friday and forced hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 meter high , 79-storey buildings .	-3.8796
It is the second fire which , for only two years , has been swinging through the high house , which is randomly called the Torch Tower ( torch tower ) .	-6.4214
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-1.8778
" We slept and we stood up with the fire alarm and the cries of the people .	-3.1271
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor " , told a inhabitants who called his name as George Angab , Reuters .	-4.4660
Dubai 's civil protection authorities said that the mechanisms to prevent fires from happening at 4 p.m. local time ( 00.00 GMT ) caused fire and chilled the building .	-6.9556
The government said that it works to provide shelter for those affected .	-2.4157
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in areas of high houses around the world .	-3.4143
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 found that the bulk of the damage came from coverings , outdoor clothing for decoration and isolation .	-6.4430
In Britain , the police said that they believe that the system of panels for isolation and coverings in London ’ s Grenfell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .	-9.2344
No Davis-Cup reform : Continue best-of-measure .	-3.9112
The President of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has gone through with his large Davis-Cup-coupon at the General Assembly .	-4.5224
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh-City , the proposal for this sport of revolutionary policy of playing Davis-Cup alone on two winning rates was hardly supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-6.8132
This , which is often very long , but also very valued , five-mark classic will remain traditional .	-7.1866
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of reform , and the objective of the ITF President , David Haggie , was therefore very weak .	-6.9516
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-3.4632
We need an amendment to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical contests , " said Hagging .	-4.3373
You will continue to work to improve your application .	-2.3965
Not only did it come to the vote , after many of the protests , before the proposal was made to wear the final in a neutral place .	-5.9984
The finalists at the Davis Cup and the Fed Cup will have the host right in the next round .	-4.6729
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the requirements for training places , etc . , will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-5.4207
More than 1 out of 5 US passengers will bring prohibited items to the aircraft , a survey will take place .	-3.9977
A survey carried out by air passengers revealed that more than 20 % were deliberately or unconscious prohibited items were smuggled over the Control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 % of which affected the aircraft while wearing accidentally prohibited knights or other items .	-8.3831
Less than 1 % claimed that they would have been belated to have discovered that they were tamed with guns , ammunition or explosives .	-5.6167
The survey of more than 1,000 people - conducted by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also noted that younger travellers are rather disregarding the rules .	-4.9670
Of the respondents who admitted that they had deliberately tried to fly with something banned by TSA , 19.7 % were millionaires compared to less than 15 % who were members of the generation X .	-5.4028
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.6358
More than 3 % of the female respondents admitted that they had deliberately banned drugs on the aircraft , while 2.2 % of the female respondents and 3.7 % of the male questioned were .	-6.4988
The company said it consulted travellers around the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods had brought through airport safety and how many had deliberately done it .	-5.1441
It is no surprise that the people who are the most smugglers - knowingly or ignorantly - wear safety are those who fly most often .	-5.6522
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are rather complicated and confusing .	-2.9494
People are often unsure which liquids they may take or how much of them them .	-4.9323
So it is no surprise that the vast amount of objects seized by TSA are prohibited liquids .	-3.8212
For a time people thought the TSA could view books as jewellery .	-3.2747
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.9069
Elon Musk doesn 't care : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order .	-2.3122
Elon Musk Electric Exchange will be happy to provide you with the huge number of preliminary orders for its new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-5.7082
He has declined so far that some of the customers have already withdrawn their noncommittal reservation .	-7.0842
In addition to the increasingly triumphant figures on revenue increases and even more massive sales targets , Tesla boss Elon Musk has for the first time performed a different , less glamorous figure in announcing the most recent quarterly balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-8.0499
Musk has often indicated more than 500,000 reservations for the new car , whose delivery begins in recent months .	-5.4201
Muse admits : Of all 518.000 preliminary orders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-5.7030
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-3.1952
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the € 1000 ( US $ 1000 in the United States and <unk> 1000 in the UK ) a full deposit .	-6.2752
45,000 such noncommittal reservations are currently available .	-4.3132
But the Tesla boss does not believe that canceling about 12 % of all orders to date would become a problem .	-5.4426
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not on demand , but on the productive .	-3.1771
Last year Tesla delivered 834 vehicles .	-1.2743
In 2018 , all models assembled , it should be 500,000 , a million in 2020 .	-3.4524
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.3739
The Musk system allows you to have 1800 reservations per day .	-5.9601
If you order a " model 3 " today , you can expect delivery in the second half of the year in 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand-new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without major interruptions at maximum utilisation .	-6.8361
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.7439
If there is too much delay , then the incompatibility of reservations about Tesla could become .	-3.8091
After all , companies cannot stop dissatisfied customers from slipping in .	-5.2093
EPA leader Pruvt is retreat because of the delay in the Obama-Era rules to reduce emissions .	-4.5859
One day after being sud by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obaman era rules to reduce emissions of smog air pollutants .	-5.4396
Pruitt presented change when its agency proved to be better suited to the needs of national environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-5.1212
He did not mention the case that had been brought against his previous post in a federal court .	-5.1299
It is a deadline , enacted on 1 October , for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.8524
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by a year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth " .	-3.6136
Pruitt , President Donald Trump ’ s Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma , has long been a more reliable opponent of environmental legislation .	-4.4042
From his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-3.6650
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruites regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.8438
Last month , a federal government court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator overstepped his authority when trying to delay implementation of a rule by the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies committed to monitoring and reducing methane leaks .	-5.2948
In an opinion published on Wednesday , Pruitt proposed that his U-turn to ozone standards would simply increase the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in time .	-4.9458
" Under previous administrations , the EPA often did not meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by active groups and others and , in an agreement , set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sut the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-6.1981
" We do not believe in judicial regulation and we take deadlines seriously .	-3.0134
We also take the law and the authority that we have . '	-2.0026
However , the opinion of the EPA said that Pruitt will at some point use its " authority to delay and all other powers available legally , " to ensure that the rules are based " on a solid policy and the best available information " .	-7.2161
Congress Republicans are pushing for a broader reconversion of the ozone rules .	-3.2855
A bill approved last month will delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.4846
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.7430
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneider , who led the coalition of the states that had sued the EPA this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-3.5919
" The reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety from these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flowing into their communities , " said Schneider .	-5.4061
In this case , New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont , Washington , and Columbia .	-4.0099

Public health officials and environmentalists jumped about Pruitts ’ surprising course changes .	-4.8239
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to take this sensible step from those responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.2125

750 Years of St. Hilarius Church : On the occasion of the anniversary of the mountain church the old Friedhof complex is invited to a Serenade in Tumbingen on Sunday , 16 July .	-5.1046
Whether its idyllic location and beautiful views of the town , the historic St. Hilarius complex is a popular place to stay .	-3.6230
The visitors of the sixth Benefiz-Ernande can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-4.0952
The restoration and preservation of the oldest building in the village made friends and beneficer tumbling their concern .	-4.8808
Walter stresses : " It is a unique village jewel " .	-3.0868
In 1267 , the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the museum 's original book in Baden-Württemberg : Count Hermann sold by Sulz " the mountain with the church to tumble along with the Vosges church " at the Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .	-7.7642

Association wants to have the approval of wind bicycles under review	-6.3208
" Boisheim opposes " sees no legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the Council .	-6.3084
The association " Boisheim rejects itself " has invited LandCouncil Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind power plants in the Boisheier Nete .	-6.3392
It was unlawful .	-2.4961
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 in the Boisheim Netke could not have been approved as a wind power plant , since at the time in Viewsen there was only a wind power center on the urban border with Schwalmtal .	-6.9664
Under this concentration zone , construction and operation of wind power plants are possible as a matter of principle , but at the same time the concentration zone also makes the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-6.2132
Such zones should prevent the " distraction " of the landscape .	-4.5965
The city of Viesen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette just a few days before by amending the Plan for land use - but the county government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a mistake .	-9.2573
" The absence of a planning legal requirement continues to make the granted approval certificate illegal and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim " .	-6.3333
The current state of affairs : before the summer break , the Council of Ministers once again decided to concentrate the Nice wind zone in the Boisheim ; an authorisation from the district government is still pending .	-8.3754
Erkens : " This means that authorisation for the establishment of wind energy planning systems is legally excluded . "	-5.6302
The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .	-2.4457
" The corresponding letters have been entered by the circle of four since last week , " explained a speaker .	-5.4113
The group is taking it as an opportunity to look again at the matter .	-4.5106
However , they are not likely to stop the process .	-2.6918
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the circle did not wish to comment on the content of the association " Boisheim defenses himself " on Thursday .	-5.4855
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four metres of high wind turbines on an area on the Boisheim Netze .	-7.2375

Transcrite of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexican and Australian leaders were published by the Washington Post .	-3.3507
On 27 January , in a Mexican president Enrique Pena Nito , Trump asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-4.1004
The US president dismissed him because he publicly denounced the wall , according to which he said : ' You cannot say this to the press ' .	-4.3404
Trump started his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and swore to pay Mexico for the project .	-3.5064
Transcription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turbull was also published and revealed an exciting exchange .	-3.1028
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US would take over refugees who emigrated to Australia " laughably , " mies " and " stupid " , and that the existence of trade that the Obama administration was saying would allow him to look like a " depp " after he proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US .	-17.9038

Moores Ford massacre : activists are relaying racist Lynchaft as a call for justice .	-4.6027
A 1948-er Ford Mercury traveled through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and visited the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-3.6701
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men met with guns to block its way .	-3.7328
The leader of the mob - a man of middle age in a nael strip - took a long train from his cigar and looked at by the windshield .	-5.0465
Inevitably , the defendants clashed in fear .	-3.7224
" We want them ---- r Roger ! " loved the man .	-2.2879
" Go him out of the car ! "	-1.6462
Shroud the silence when a young black man was dragged from the front-passenger seat .	-3.0547
Fortunately , this terrible scene that was played on July 22 is only a tribute .	-3.9039
But when a sludge is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost all of the audience received real sighs .	-5.1967
Since 2005 civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , as well as George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.1391
No one has ever been charged with the killings .	-1.8934
" It is truly incomprehensible that there has been no single person arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the presentation .	-6.5724
" It is a gem on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.7207
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a civil rights activist for life .	-4.1615
For him , the post serves as a dramatic call for action , and constitutes an annual reminder of the monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.5382
" We want criminal prosecution , we want an end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , " he said .	-3.3304
" We cannot heal and achieve reconciliation until we receive justice . "	-1.6198
The court agent is responsible for the plight of one of the victims of the Moore-order syndrome on 27 July 1946 .	-6.9985
According to FBI-acts received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynchprocess .	-3.7012
But no one has ever been prosecuted .	-1.6479
Although the suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights activists say that the dual motivation for the Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-3.8818
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court decision allowed Georgia ’ s black citizens to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .	-3.7197
Around the same time as the election , according to the FBI , Roger Malcom ’ s black farsightedness caused a white landowner , Barnett Hester , to complete a fight – supposedly due to a woman .	-7.1241
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had waded with Malcoms Dorothy , and that the baby she wore did not come from her husband .	-4.4336
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid 600 dollars to liberate Malcom from prison , the FBI said .	-3.4264
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey into prison .	-2.5516
But when they moved away from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.9506
" As it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared and ordered the assassinations , " concludes a FBI report .	-3.5740
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the killing , removed evidence and lost the identity of witnesses " .	-5.6258
Brooks formulates it even more striking .	-2.7238
" It was an election rights massacre , " he said .	-2.0035
" You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you register and if you vote , this will happen to you . "	-3.6188
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene has guided the annual performance of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-3.9154
Their narrative is illustrative , biased , and is rooted in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe is no longer in America .	-5.3107
It is difficult to look and look even harder to get away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-4.5596
" We do not want to talk about the Lynchen , because then we are confronted with its obscene in all of us , " she said .	-3.6128
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done . "	-3.0108
The samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of blacks - pushed into a space and laughed when Greene started a well-chosen overview of the piece .	-5.6140
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co-Director .	-2.9755
He has been playing the role of chief clan for years , but he said that the role would never be simpler .	-4.0386
" I feel dirty because I am not like " , Marbaugh said .	-1.8203
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-2.7868
On the other side of the room , actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester attempted their lines .	-3.6160
The piece begins with Malcom , who joined Hester and besieged him , angry that he had slaughtered with his wife Dorothy .	-4.7798
" I said n --- he , skipped of my property ! "	-2.7510
Rascona denies the fire .	-2.9842
There is a break .	-1.0753
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) can laugh in the dark .	-4.9665
Greene laughs in the loudest .	-2.4272
" What ? ! " , Mrs Rascona asked .	-3.4424
It is alarming and confused .	-1.0964
Was I too harsh ?	-1.6214
" No " , said Greene , still kichering .	-1.6620
" I just do not believe that white people at the time ' n --- he ' said . the and are . are , , and , , , , , ,	-6.8269
" But " , " quipped one of the other black actors .	-3.3182
" You just have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-1.6432
And this is where energy is shifting in the room , a feeling of cameramen replaces the unease .	-4.5103
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.0247
The scene begins again .	-1.5306
This time when Rascona says the word N , he says it clearly and forcefully .	-3.8167
No one laugh .	-1.6108
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-1.4176
There are shrines , shots and then silence .	-2.4430
A woman dressed with a sadness stands at the corpses of the actors and leads Billie Holidays 's mourning speech " Strange Fruit " .	-5.6900
Her voice breaks with every second word .	-1.9089
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of around four dozen spectators weld and tears out of sight .	-4.4412
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-2.9255
A couple is from Itha , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the street .	-4.4059
They have experienced the intense moisture of Georgia for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them to the burial sites of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage .	-6.3004
Up to this point , the killings have remained an anecdote , but now , when you are on the same country where the Lynch killings took place , the air is sparingly moored .	-5.6753
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites you to come closer and paint the glue name .	-4.1517
Children tickle at their heads , register the fake blood and the silent body and die each other .	-3.5834
" They are not really dead " , murmelt a young boy as if he would remember it .	-3.9026
After a few minutes thanks Greene the crowd - and suddenly it 's over .	-2.2531
The actors cast the LynchSoleil and wipe their tears .	-2.9471
Bradshaw killed Marbaugh , the man in the suit , who played the clan member .	-5.9366
Nick Rascona addresses two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their poor , the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him .	-4.6104
" It is okay " , wears one of women .	-2.6354
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.5167
You did so for one reason ' .	-2.1205
Later , the public will join the actors for dinner .	-3.2643
At a table , a white pair of Atlanta appears appears to be hanging over the post with a black pair you have just heard .	-6.2804
Denise Duelinski struggled to find words that feel left the performance .	-3.2029
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and who do so because they look like you , " she said .	-3.8409
" What really does with me makes me believe that the Lynchen still goes on , " she added , " today the only police sniper is called . "	-5.1206
In the same space , Tyrone Brooks Hof keeps at his table , he feeds and reminds of civil rights .	-5.2877
He said he started to plan the performance next year .	-1.6729
" Recreation is in a way inspiring , because it describes the horrors of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.8855

The EPA announced , late on Wednesday , the decision to advance the so-called ' ozone regulation in 2015 ' and said that it demonstrates the agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-5.1941
" We believe in dialogue and in reacting to our state partners , " said EPA-chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.9943
Pruitt announced in June the intention of the EPA to assess ozone rules - in which some of the country should be able to measure pollutants emissions in order to determine where reductions need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018 .	-6.2205
A group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , filed a complaint on Tuesday , saying that the effort was illegal .	-3.1413
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to go back a wide range of environmental challenges imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda to boost economic growth , according to Trump .	-4.1997
The effort , however , has given rise to the setback of the Democrats and nature conservation groups who are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-4.8669

Regional Council wants Community space	-4.7368
In the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two countervotes , the county council of Fluorn-Winken decides to create a community space in the future residential area .	-6.8476
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract is signed for the missing property maze , filed mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.4315
Although it will still take until the land belonging to the parish to date is owned by the parish , there is now no planning obstacle to the project being completed by a private investor .	-6.2145
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-2.9290
One of the two investors who are still on the boat has offered to go to the village .	-4.1083
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square metres - and an adjoining terrace with an area of 70 square metres for a special price .	-4.5655
The administration and the majority of the municipal council propose that such a common area should not be set up as a meeting point for the inhabitants of the ancient residential area , but open to the municipality .	-7.7298
As an example , the word from " Strickkoé " made the round .	-3.6841
The decision made last autumn by the provision of funds for the current budget will be covered by funding opportunities .	-5.7543
The construction is in the area of restoration .	-3.2978
According to Tjaden , the creation of a common area would be capable of promoting 60 % of 30 % .	-4.4718
The resolution proposal , in order to signal to the investor that he does not want to throw his head between his legs in this regard , states that both the saddle - which is an environmental issue - and the pull roof - which reduces the height of the race and makes the construction of economic power possible .	-9.4457
Not only Wilfried Sohmer believes that this addition is necessary .	-4.0301
If 's helping : it happens to the body .	-3.8918
The Community area is not so easy .	-2.8455
Daniela reputation refers to the many own buildings that we are not moving so far , for which we are now opposed to in the common space of the window , she says : ' I am struggling with it ' .	-8.2410
Yvonne StaPeople is absolutely in favour of the community , but absolutely against community participation .	-4.9187
It provides for a hidden subsidy to the already well-off or even to foreign investors .	-3.7429
This is not the case , because if the area is purchased , the item is not given a grant , but instead provides a real countervalue , if any doubt is marketable .	-8.5693
There are three advocates of the proposal for a balanced resolution .	-4.7082
So it remains for two votes in the original program that Stefan Haller summarizes : " If we take the decision in this way , we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure " .	-5.9156

Hiking in Harz of Stern to Stern	-2.8533
Harz is said to be the first " star trail " in Germany .	-4.6600
The association Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg is planning this .	-2.5789
There is a planetary road in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.7859
A " star-trail " goes against the need for information from many Harzguests , it was said .	-5.5452
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.7026
The members want to prepare along the planned routes and inform about stars and constellations .	-4.4504
In a first phase to 2018 , the Association is planning " well reachable installations in five to six places " in Oberharz .	-5.6033
Infrage buds St. Andreasberg , BraunLage , Houß und Sieber .	-5.7708
The information on the boards is meant to be updated on the Internet .	-3.9919
Therefore a good mobile reception is important for selecting the location .	-4.2861
Non-accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.5963
Later the Star Trek train will be extended by train .	-5.0801
" On the starlit trail , the viewer gets a lot of information , such as the physics of the stars , " the association explained .	-6.4685
They also learned why stars had different colors or why a star had more light than another star , even though it was far further away .	-5.1382
It also arranges the constellation in which a selected star is located and when he is best to see .	-5.1577
Since 2014 , the association has been operating in the mining town of St. Andreasberg , the highest among northern Germany ’ s star stores .	-7.0178
The location in the heart of Harz National Park is one of the six darkest areas in Germany , according to the Federal Office for Nature Protection .	-4.7560
They are often seen from the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with a clear eye .	-4.5703
In the Uni-City since 2003 , the Planetarium Göttingen initiative has been doing something similar to the planned starships - the planetary route .	-6.8470
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goethe allee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetway leads with its stells up to the Hainberg and the Sternwarte - as well as an " extraterrestrial " site in Dimarden ( community equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-7.5287
The Stells with the individual planets - including the Pluto at the end - are positioned exactly at a distance of one to two billion .	-6.0293
The Earth thus shrinks to a sphere of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters distant sun is still measuring 70 centimetres .	-6.4511
The entire distance of the planetary motion is about four kilometres .	-4.1584
While light is needed for about eight hours from the sun to the Pluto , pedestrians need a good hour to reach the Sze with Pluto .	-6.7555
Thus , pedestrians are faster than the light in the world .	-3.8321
The march to the next few blocks , however , would last for half a year .	-4.4714

" I am a former head of state " , remember Garcia .	-4.2472
" I grew up for bronze [ to <unk> 140 ] , but I 'm not so large .	-3.3828
I am small for 140 .	-1.2109
I would like to soften my weight .	-3.1381
And he has to move to light bracelets [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-4.7873
This is what fans demand .	-3.5201
Let us give them that . '	-1.0425
Lomé was in agreement .	-2.4370
'Boxes need this fight ' .	-1.1895
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-view , part of a strategy that must fight Lomachenko with a 135-pound debut this year to arrange a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) who also interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Lines-Campbell 's easy title struggle in the Forum on 23 September .	-7.3839
" This fight could take place in Pay-per-View-mode , because all fans asked for him , " said Garcia and later openly expressed their desire to fight in the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.1842
We are the best .	-0.7082
No other name can generate this kind of attention .	-1.9677
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.1113
Garcia said that he appreciated Lomachinko as a " giant fighter " and he might be taking part in his Samstag-fight .	-5.7535
But Lomachenko continued to receive generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks that the three-fight champion from Riverside " very slowly out , sorry Mikey ... you wanted to know the Ko Out " .	-6.2679
Garcia said that the focus was to show the strength , then boxes .	-2.1751
Both said that they could feel the moment for their own fight .	-3.5141
" This is the battle that must be performed .	-2.9439
No other fight will give so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.3395
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.8216

Four Injuries to Reifenplatters	-3.7547
In an accident on the A7 , four people were partially injured in the Thursday afternoon .	-4.5288
After the first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at the junction of the market , probably after a tyre runner .	-7.1351
The car was pushed to the right , where it was slippery and then on the roof there was a green strip .	-7.8867
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .	-1.7465
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour , then the traffic on the left was passing by the accident .	-6.0524
Forstas Hoffmann : " Trio works better "	-3.6233
Andre Hoffmann hopes for the 2 : 2 season competition against Braunschweig that the optimization of defensive information in Aue points will bring .	-4.8812
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first seasonal game , and the result would have been that the two opposing Braunschweig contradict each other .	-6.7487
" These were two opposite too much , and we have to watch even better in Aue , " says the defensive player of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-4.9553
In the foothills of the Kart Mountains , the triplate should also be optimized further .	-7.0444
And a gate for a push no longer wants to invaded the lagoons .	-5.6219
" For the future it will be the case that no one will take the line next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-4.2254
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better able to cope even after the experience in preparation with the trite than with the four-boot ette .	-7.1122
" I still do not know how we will act in Aue " , says his trainer Friedhelm Funk , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing " because we have just in the three-band on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giessmann players who can build well " , Hoffmann said .	-6.8207
" A precondition is , but that we are even better harmonised and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction . "	-6.4482
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-1.8871
" But whether you can speak of a failed start after a decision has been taken does not know .	-5.3434
The performance could be quite okay , " Hoffmann said .	-4.2097
" But if we are on the Sunday with four points and can focus on the Pokal , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal act . "	-5.5090
His coach did not want to know about this .	-3.1804
" I tested the start in the season only after six to eight days , " said Friedhelm Funk , who does not want to speak of an advantage towards Aue , just because the play of the Sachsen in Heidenheim had to be aborted early on because of an unexpected .	-7.7263
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believe that players from Aue might even be more fresh , because they don 't have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a top-up favorite in the bone .	-6.9429
" But they don 't know as 100 % where they are now , " says the inside supporter of the Fortuna .	-4.6861
Although guests from the Rhineland will find themselves as a light favourite on Sunday in the encounter in the finally ( almost ) made stadium of Aue .	-5.9130
" That we chase them out just because we have the right to come under the first six is Blödtsdinn " , says Funkel , whose balance in the event of a defeat against Aue from nine games is certainly positive .	-8.4827
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which you have to fight from the start " , says Fortrata 's Chief coach .	-6.8444
'To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' . the of were , , , , and , , and , , , , , ,	-4.9867
And so Funky doesn 't want to experience his players on the Sunday .	-5.2549
Release New Results of the Swedish Asylum Thirty Assessment tests	-3.8151
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subject to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of those tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-5.0529
The Swedish agency for Forensic Medicine ( CRP ) has started the implementation of the tests last year .	-5.7635
They should make the assessment of age more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish Immigration Authority ( Immigrant Cut ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees , who were less aged .	-7.8869
To date , the report sent 6.880 lead cases , and Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2.481 tests from mid-March to July 31 , 2017 .	-6.1231
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were considered 18 or older , while in more 25 cases Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.2914
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 " .	-2.6039
The tests are only carried out in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-3.1781
According to Johan Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-5.4693
" We see no big difference in statistics of recent months , the figures are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-8.2112
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.5117
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases suggesting that the examined person was 18 years or older .	-3.3082
When Svenska Dagblad studied the 581 published results , she noted that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it was 18 years old this year .	-3.5618
The medical age assessment method , in which X-ray images are made of white teeth and MRT recordings of knees , analysed by dentists and radiologists , was also criticised in some areas .	-7.3449
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people in order to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later .	-5.0214
" I had reason to think about this and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.5672
To assess biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-3.1282
If we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , " he said the metro newspaper .	-3.8068
Göransson , however , defended the accuracy of the tests by the Forensic Medicine Agency : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child as an adult is low .	-4.3054
The biggest risk is that if the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % ' .	-4.4701
Full in Plan	-0.4133
The work on the three bridges of the road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well underway .	-4.5175
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete part of the bridge was installed on the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.6463
" We are very good in the time it is running super " , says Reinhold Leichst , Head of Construction at the Department of Road and Traffic in the Government Bureau of Freiburg .	-5.9488
In April , the work began at the same time on all three reconstructed bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.8939
The building is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is adhered to .	-4.2680
Coming from Schramberg the first bridge leads across the Trombach .	-3.0987
It is a filament bridge made of concrete , dressed with red buntsstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-5.0179
It was built in 1900 .	-1.0940
Like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .	-2.1843
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now properly renovated .	-5.3986
The other two bridges lead across the Lauterbach .	-2.3789
They are built from red buntsandstein .	-1.9877
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 , respectively 10.60 meters long .	-2.7489
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach on Wednesday morning , on the northern side , has now received a 1.30 m large and seven tons of heavy bridge-cap .	-6.8335
This is a marginal fortress , which is also used as a working way .	-4.6333
On the southern part of the bridge , a 2,20 m broad bridge chapel is to be used on Friday .	-4.0487
That is what the pedestrian road is supposed to be .	-3.7974
The special thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberger company Diforto .	-4.9199
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-1.6632
An extraordinary amount of fingerbreaking has required the transfer of lines by the works in Lauterbach .	-5.8473
Because there is a glass-fibre label that many companies are connected to .	-4.3439
The locals were informed about the project in advance of the works by Handzettel .	-4.5910
In addition , fish and cancers had to be fished down .	-3.1761
For the bridges between the building building building building building building and the mining branch in the direction of Schramberg , the traffic is progressively controlled by an ampel .	-6.1555
The road in the area of the bridge on the Tannerhof Hotel and the 7th Line is completely closed for the construction work on the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance .	-6.1004
The cost of the three bridge anifications is € 700 000 .	-5.1337
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-2.3304
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter protest at German potato alat .	-1.9028
It is not often the case that parties are pulling in the same direction , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , what is otherwise difficult to reconcile .	-5.0898
The parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , left ) represented at the round day of volcanic ice belong to a broad alliance that shows peaceful flag on this day because the AfD invites in the Gerolstein City Hall dell Ronan as the poster says " big campaign " .	-7.0226
And known names start - like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the leading duo for the federal election on 24 September , and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-5.3650
But the hours before the event begins do not want to listen to the AfD students , but rather to demonstrate .	-5.3707
The motto " The oaster remains colourful " .	-4.4094
Originally , the town-picnic was planned under the motto " All at a table " on Brunnenplatz , but now it takes place on the car park below the Rondell - and thus right in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-7.2427
A colourful picture that is there .	-4.1900
And what Christia Karoli , Chairman of the Forum A and one of the leading organizers , really welcomes : " Toll , how many people have come together here " .	-5.7678
There is music and a lot of food , including a " original German potato salad , which the AfD could eat without any problem " , says the woman who brought him .	-4.4513
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and it is mainly visible at the railway station , which is only a few metres away from the events .	-6.7764
How did the AfD come to Gerolstein ?	-1.9607
Mario Hompets from the AfD volcano summit reported that he was working for such an event and received the additional charge .	-5.8431
The 45-year-old Gönnersdorf had first inquired in Daan , but they got a cancellation because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built Laurentiuskirmes .	-5.2712
So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.4377
With a view to the event on Rondellpreplatz he says : " That is the good law of the people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.9713
This is also the case : a band for entertainment takes place at the Rondellplatz in the city hall , with several speakers including the swinging gowl AfD chairman Uwe Young .	-8.4921
In the hall , about 200 people are waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix von Storch ’ s speeches .	-5.6689
The police presence is incomprehensible , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.3682
The AfD event lasts somewhat more than an hour , the guests on the front desk have a longer breathing space , but there is also a short wait for 9 p.m.	-8.4648
The police can break - no special incidents .	-2.4636

" We must do everything we can to normalise this situation in the coming months .	-2.4613

Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is unclear .	-2.4526
But he does not intend to be there in his French home .	-3.2744
Prince Henrik had never made it clear that he was not happy with his title .	-3.2913

My Danisch was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk darts , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-3.7856
Even for the palloises that I smoke instead of Virginia tobacco and who had the reputation of being the brand of corporate critical intellectuals , I could not hope for indulgence .	-5.3560
I was different .	-1.0836

The Prime Minister ’ s quick re-election	-3.6665
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.6893
Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , according to the loss of the red-green government ’ s majority , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country day , but he does not want to resign .	-6.4925
Because , on Friday , Parliament voted in favour of the resolution .	-3.2639
Previously , the surprising removal of a Green MEP from her country parliamentary assembly in Lower Saxony overthrown Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-5.5885
Five months before the official date of the country election , the coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-minute majority in Parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP .	-4.6009
Elke Twster , the former Green MEP , has taken a long time step with the non-nomination for the election in 2018 in their constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-9.3730
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.1334
Christian Democrat leader Bérn Thümler wants to recommend his group to accept it .	-4.9037
Thus , CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony Land Day , SPD , and Greens 68 seats .	-4.1515
So far , the relationship has been the reverse .	-1.5671
The new day of land is regularly elected on 14 January next year .	-3.0393
Thümler said that the red-green state government must now decide whether to continue governing without majority in this situation .	-3.6862
Stephan Weiß , however , considers it essential that the day of land decide for itself as quickly as possible .	-4.6018
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its follow-up on Tuesday .	-2.6495
National Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Prime Minister cut trust and elect a successor .	-4.3467
" Our constitution offers several options .	-1.0763
These possibilities have to be verified in a legally correct manner , " said Thorümler .	-4.5325
" You will be discussing all questions in silence when they are legally reasonable . "	-4.7744
Thümler called Twestens step " but somewhat curious " .	-4.3836
The politician himself emphasised : " I am not a traitor .	-2.1489
I feel very good ' .	-1.4523
They called themselves a supporter of the Black Green .	-3.9572
The Greens have called on the MEPs to return their country day .	-3.6054
" We assume , of course , that they have returned with immediate effect their country mandate through the green border list , " the provincial chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner with it .	-8.4379
The Green Group chairman Anja Piel said : ' We regret the decision of Elke Tweste extraordinarily ' .	-4.2225
You have deliberately chosen not to have a debate in the group .	-3.4238
" Even against the background that there were no substantive differences , we cannot understand this step " .	-3.2478
German Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the passage of the Lower Saxony Green Party member Elke Twsten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-6.0495
" The behaviour of the former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the voters , but also betrayal of the red green , " the head of the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-4.2907
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s decision to let the country day elect quickly .	-4.5792
Exit Twestens costs red green in Lower Saxony .	-3.6476
The politician " in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country " , the SPD Secretary-General , Hubertus Heir .	-5.4968
" It is a scandal that the CDU , in Lower Saxony , shares this ugly Intrassive game and tries to capitalize on it . "	-5.8315
Niedersachsen CDU-Group chairman Bérn Thümler wants to recommend to his member that Elke Tweste be be included in the CDU .	-7.2166
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Optermann , accused Twsten of falsifying the result of the 2013 country election with a personal career .	-7.0928

Agriculture Ministers in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-6.7840
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.4359
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.2687
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.1435
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in interview with the German editor network ( RND ) .	-3.7716
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.9185
I can only encourage all consumers to take a close look at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamps .	-7.8309
On the consumer protection portal www.Food Wartunung.de the federal states submit the latest information on the egg Chargen concerned .	-6.0959
The interested eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-2.4751
Even if , as we know at the moment , health risks are practically excluded .	-3.6290
Are Aldi now overtaking the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the pupil is not really recognized by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs ?	-5.3131
Food surveillance is a task for the federal states .	-2.1094
Nevertheless , my House immediately opened up and it has been known since the death of Germany in close exchange with the authorities of the countries .	-5.9965
All information and risk assessment can be made available to consumers .	-1.9526
Trade , like the manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are safe and healthy .	-5.2180
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded , these are not accessible .	-3.1529
Unloaded eggs can be sold and eaten , however .	-4.8914
This time , they are not to blame .	-2.6283
Are manufacturing companies and consumers on the same boat ?	-2.1112
As we now know , production operations are not directly at fault .	-3.4921
Instead , they must reckon with economic damage because of the alleged illegal practices of service companies .	-3.8201
As always , there are too few inspectors in the worst case .	-2.9371
Is it just a matter of personnel or of coherent competence ?	-3.9293
It was the official checks that revealed the process .	-4.1737
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out at 100 % .	-3.2376
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor is crucial in cases where crimes can be committed .	-6.0130
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the authorities responsible .	-3.8127
Is regular alert to food scandals really necessary ?	-2.3345
Consumers have the right to exclusively obtain safe and trafficked food .	-3.5696
If a non-approved insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indignant .	-4.3830
The package means that manufacturers , traders and consumers are in a situation that is absolutely not necessary .	-5.2953
Basically , it must be clear that the illegal use of the insecticides fipronil in the position of transporting animals to life is unacceptable and must be brought to an end immediately .	-5.9646
This is something that must be worked consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-4.4366
I expect all the competent authorities to ensure that the matter is clarified swiftly and in full .	-4.9456
How the financial rules of football affect Neymars ’ move to Paris .	-3.9864
The rules aimed at preventing unspent expenditure on European football clubs are not going to disturb Neymars world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-4.9812
There will be some consequences for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the leading organisation that monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Championship election tournament .	-6.3552
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will have to prove that the transfer of nemmar was financed without great losses .	-4.2744
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to purchase the Brazilian from its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary of $ 10 million per year .	-6.8166
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymars relocation to France .	-2.6016
PSG can surely ease the money so that Neymar agrees and bring him to a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar .	-5.5278
Club members may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must deal with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them the Break event point in their business on football .	-6.8652
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as President of UEFA in 2007 .	-3.3600
The former French player believed that societies that had taken enormous debts in their quest for success would effectively cheat and risk ruin if banks or owners had cut back their support .	-5.5192
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentration on Klubs ’ debt to monitoring their losses .	-2.6812
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovivich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - a club with potential bought and then actively invested to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder affair .	-4.6213
During the current three-year FFP period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.6721
And , despite the fact that Platini fell in disquiet in 2015 from the presidency , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to favor efforts to deter excessive spending .	-7.1088
" To be sure , FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , towards The Associated Press last week .	-3.3371
Although the PSG has paid the Nemmar Buy-out clause in a lump-sum , it may distribute the amount for reporting the duration of its contract .	-4.0821
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the sum of the sum of the sum of the sum for the next five years can be earmarked at EUR 44.4 million in the annual accounts .	-5.1519
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , along with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , took the strongest sanctions .	-3.3796
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members remain limited to 21 players in the season 2014 / 15 for the 2014 / 15 .	-5.6035
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial oversight by inflating their revenues from companies associated with club owners .	-4.5255
While a kataric company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsor were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not be considered a legitimate income .	-5.7197
That is what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was bloated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-4.8973
It was reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come into Qatar via payments from the organizing committee of the World Cup 2022 .	-5.0683
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have denied that Neymar WM ’ s ambassador will be , and that such a maneuver could easily be found for the UEFA Regulators .	-6.4727
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.0640
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-2.9493
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity , as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.6491
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has made a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-3.3832
The accounts for the last financial year are still to be published .	-2.1811
PSG expects Neymars arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring Deals , merchandising and trico-selling .	-3.3147
The association assumes that the sales will rise by at least 30 percent after the signature .	-3.4761
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going and it tried to prevent Neymars from taking the train by arguing that PSG would violate the FFP .	-4.2338
" It is a clear case of " funding doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS AS referring to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-4.4685
Arsenal manager Wenger , whose association is owned by an American Sports Tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club .	-3.2699
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole football landscape in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.7634
" Once a country has a club , it 's all possible .	-3.3434

Industrial insiders estimate the volume of orders in accordance with " north-west Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million Francs - the Migros subsidiary generates an annual turnover of around 1 billion francs .	-5.8016
But the promotional effect is all the more important : for a shoppers it is a prestigious order .	-4.3658
The Swiss does not want to give up as many applicants for the new tender .	-4.9920
In question , only Swiss manufacturers will be able to answer this question .	-4.9014
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to see a renewal of the Treaty of Spring 2018 .	-4.3153

Nostalgia goes into " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detection " into the Nile .	-3.7392
This repetition of history is simultaneously nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 years , for the 90-year period of greeting ( as the historian David Wain and Michael Showage turned the Sketch Comödie " The State " for MTV ) , and for itself - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things .	-6.8524
As a cultural artefact , it is also a parody and a embodiment of our facebook enabled era of permanent memories .	-4.0457
But as a franchise it feels as if time were short .	-2.3394
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a spoken dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.5491
By telling the core of the Gag - actors of middle age play boys who grow up - they still managed to get back the last part of the joke .	-8.2667

The loving coop ( Mr. Showold ) , now Roman author , Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) has still not forgotten .	-3.7622
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his viruleness .	-3.4971
And there is another crazy plot in which Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showold ) is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a very successful figure of Michael Ian Black ) .	-5.0021
As usual , excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-3.0960
It is especially fun to see the ever young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dilllons Sublimbart of " Singles " , whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old knee .	-5.6837
They are the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I thought as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty-Years " , whose last scene will show the band , as they will visit the movie premiere of " Wet American Summer " .	-6.3094
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon now reminds us of another kind of nostalgia : the revitalisation of the Cold War of " The Americas " , the film " Atomic Blonds " and even " GLOW " with its East contrasting West fighting iconography .	-6.5319
The Comödie , created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as the director , indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officials from Bucharest who are fighting for truth , atheism and the road of Marxism Leninism .	-6.5723
The main scrolls - a hard-pressed Gregorian and an idealist one - are played by Florian Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Chaning Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levin English .	-6.0776
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.8756
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.2225
There are some nice gags to see ( the police spends time watching television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-5.1201
And the list of famous speakers , including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Maherhala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny , provides for a decent game ' Find the vote ' .	-4.4881
But ' Comrade Detective ' is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who is wearing a Reagan-Mask - that it often plays as a single .	-7.0621
There are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-3.0253
" Comrade Detective " , which was reconstructed in a smaller length , could provide its Agitprophis better , since Gregor and Iosf always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who closed a bunch of hamburgers .	-8.2252

Two people were arrested at the same time as raids in Italy .	-2.8454
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects .	-1.8276
The two will probably be delivered to Germany .	-3.0733
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.5491
In total , over 300 police officers were deployed .	-2.5305
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised crime , serious acts of violence , of murdered murder , of robbery and of blackmail .	-4.6643
Since summer 2016 , the Konstanz prosecutor has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.2260
Between the Prosecutor 's Office in Konstanz and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottbecause had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.1853
As a result , the large-scale employment on Wednesday morning was also accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-4.2633
In particular , in view of the studies , Italian citizens were closely related to the Italian mafia .	-4.3794
Also an incident on May 27 , in Hünen , when several shots were launched early in the morning into a restaurant , will go to the account of the bands .	-6.2430
Morning large gaps in the country register	-5.0008
'Citizens ' data that should not be mentioned here ' : according to a report , the country register in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-5.3239
This leads to some serious misjudgements in the field of asylum procedures .	-3.4086
According to a media report , the representative for the management of refugees of the Federal Government , Frank-Jürgen , drew attention to major gaps in the transnational register .	-6.2345
In the case of asylum procedures and deportations , the shortcomings of the data registered could lead to serious misdecisions in the field of asylum procedures and expulsions , it warned in a way that is available to the ' Southern German newspaper ' .	-8.6623
The register states that ten million people are nationals of foreign countries , including roughly 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.5770
The data is therefore managed by around 600 immigration authorities in Germany .	-3.2475
Because the data had not been properly nurtured , in parts the data quality has not been good .	-3.7858
In individual cases , data were found in 1921 , " of people who have long since ceased to be living , or of citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the register " .	-5.7716
'Missionary data transfers can considerably slow the reverse process ' , the report goes on .	-6.3527
Moreover , the statistics on migrant people are among EU citizens who do not need to travel .	-5.9107
Such false orders , however , led to ' a distorted debate about how to deal with those who are unable to travel , ' so it is in the analysis .	-6.6162
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun sending refugee families to Italy again under 16 years of age if they are admitted there .	-5.3562
This emerges from an internal paper from the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , the " New Osnabrück Zeitung " .	-4.5567
In the paper , therefore , the BAMF ' s proceedings concerning families with children - with the exception of infants and children - have been re-conducted by Italy since 1 June 2017 .	-6.0582
Since the end of 2014 , this has been practically impossible , as the newspaper makes reference to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.7391
According to the Dublin Convention , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching them first .	-3.0925
If a immigrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the entry country .	-3.8104
According to the explanatory statement , ' In the meantime , the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy has increased significantly . '	-5.3319
Italy has made guarantees for family reception and accommodation .	-3.5748
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( EGMR ) sees these commitments as sufficient .	-2.5804
Other EU countries would also be sending refugees back there under the Dublin agreement .	-2.8124
The internal spokesperson of the left-wing group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelspke , criticised this decision : ' Families with children are threatened because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system in conditions that are contrary to human rights and a threat to child welfare ' .	-6.3567

The blood donation service has already provided a total of 220 litres of blood in Oberreichenach .	-3.9550
At least of the twelve citizens who were honoured on Friday .	-2.1302
At first , Jürgen Greule , who now gave 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .	-4.1762
Traditionally , at the meeting of the Council of Ministers , the community is paying homage to the multifaceted willingness to donate blood .	-4.9572
" It is excellent how our body is designed to do this and we pay tribute to the donors who make their blood available to strangers , even unself-interested , " said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-7.1724
" A single blood donation helps several people " , explained by the Head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maifenbach , because the Conservatives are being crushed into their components .	-4.9151
Three people could already benefit from blood donation .	-3.3820
At the same time , Maifenbach reported about the actions carried out in the spring in Obertenbach .	-3.9928
" This year , we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK executive .	-4.0894
Apparently , the change to the theatre house led to higher numbers a few years ago .	-4.4390
Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta transducer were awarded to multiple donors for 50 donated blood .	-4.9168

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-0.7932
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation has shrunk speculation .	-4.1834
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain ' pleas ' when it put interest rates on family incomes in the midst of rising pressure .	-5.2007
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) leaders voted to hold interest rates to 0.25 % this month , with fewer members aiming to increase , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-6.0784
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % for 2017 , and 1.6 % for 2018 , and warned that pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.7109
But they signal that in the next few years interest rate increases would be needed to fuel Brexit inflation , and they said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.8116
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut Executive package , issued a year after Brexit .	-4.4192
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more within the framework of this system - at <unk> 115 billion .	-5.3999
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the central prediction of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on real household incomes continues to put consumption on " .	-5.0373
In the interest rates , they reiterated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be necessary to cool inflation and a ' somewhat larger ' extent than markets would expect .	-5.4430
The markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another one in 2020 .	-2.7018
The Bank , however , emphasized that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-3.1860
The Bank ’ s forecast growth projections for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % forecast in May and 1.7 % .	-3.4793
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.6991
The pound fell in the face of the dollar and the euro .	-2.9156
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to $ 1.11 .	-2.5666
The decision to no change comes after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced the rise in expectations of an increase in interest rates , and GDP has risen to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .	-4.4992
Growth is expected to reach 0.3 % in the third quarter , although the Bank is expected to recover slightly by the end of the year .	-3.9058
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small wage increases , as the increase will first get worse before it gets better .	-5.5594
They added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent income collapse in the next few years , but it added that wages will ' significantly recover ' at the end of their three-year forecast .	-5.9505
The economy is also reinforced by the rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-4.1166
The decision comes one year after lowering interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s sinks .	-3.4840
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for the total price and economy to be achieved .	-3.6919
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three July policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % .	-4.2892
Last month , inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the bank said that it was expected and it would resume in the coming months .	-3.8208
The Bank said that the ratio of 2 % to its target is " to the weak pound " .	-5.0724
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " In view of the recent decline of the Swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , because creditors are clamouring for business and wanting to end the year in a positive way .	-8.4052
The market looks especially good for those who run the existing deal and complete the new mortgages , and many with reasonable options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . "	-5.9922
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is supposed to bring in disputed HIV drones worth 10,000 people .	-5.3799
Patients will receive access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment after the High Court fight against the funding of the NHS drug .	-5.3967
NHS England announced that a pre-exposed prosthesis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection at high-risk patients by 86 % , is now supplied by health services over a first three-year study of 10,000 people .	-7.7176
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s Court of Appeals confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.2861
The retaliation announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS British leader Simon Stevens as a " important new intervention , " while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this a " crucial moment " .	-5.5029
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register and other hospitals will follow in October before they will be introduced in April 2018 in England .	-4.4614
Preexposed prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.4466
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in cases of infection .	-2.0865
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that just enough medicines are available in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-3.4120
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before intercourse .	-4.0847
Those who question the treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.4815
In clinics , appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-4.2597
People living in England and registered with a housekeeper can also register for possible participation in their local sexual clinic .	-4.2379
The programme will become <unk> 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.9362
The study is aimed at assessing the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as is targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.3373
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.9077
It is another milestone in the progress lasting over three decades in addressing one of the greatest health challenges of mankind . "	-4.0738
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.4264
PrEP , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , allows the English HIV epidemic to be changed .	-3.7448
From September to September , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individual and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , which will lead to the improvement of many lives .	-5.7762
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.2536
Ian Green , Chairman of Terence Higgins ’ Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly across the country , and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-5.2975
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been abolished , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . "	-4.1705
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and slow implementation by the government .	-4.2724
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-3.5865
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.4304
It is now important that this study be carried out as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that they will contribute to bringing a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . '	-5.4537
Living the Great Living : Upstairs and clever designer tricks have turned this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.4779
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , fell in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment .	-2.7204
It is situated on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-5.9170
" Before I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room " says Joanne .	-2.9277
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-1.1327
This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .	-5.9452
I was in love with her and made an offer this day . "	-3.8586
Since its first visit , the 1,000 square feet large apartment has been completely outdated .	-3.8540
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - Joanne Stabler wanted to add an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling .	-5.5959
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .	-1.8602
That was my requirement , " she says .	-2.2731
To this end , they commissioned the design and architecture studio Duck & Shed of Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill , using 12.5 feet high ceilings and creating a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.6149
The ceiling was not large enough to put two rooms on each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .	-3.8341
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-1.1260
" The steel plant is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.6291
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked one another without our loss .	-5.4397
It was not just about building a simple platform , but building the steel so that it had the correct height for the function above or below . "	-4.5416
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height - with a lot of additional drama .	-3.9640
For the intermediate floor a classic copper light window of Retus looks down over the glamorous living area .	-5.2558
Special gold furniture , silver accents and vintage days Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-4.3210
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , spaces and light .	-2.2885
At both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-2.4161
In the kitchen , the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.9618
At the entrance , mirrored units can accommodate all corners and glasses of Joanne .	-3.4415
Through the perception of a glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.9392
There is nothing new about this kitchen that can be combined .	-3.2721
The special thing about this is that it is a yarn door .	-2.6732
" A bit of engineering went into " , Erfan says of the reinforced , venerable MDF door .	-4.2917
" It is opposed so that , when you push the door up , it goes very easily . "	-4.7775
Thanks to the clever use of space and closet space , Joanne could gain an extra 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-2.9372
" At the end of the day you will sell the ground area - or as your property is estimated " , Erfan says .	-2.7898
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate based on the ground size . "	-4.1611
Here they have succeeded in increasing soil area and at the same time using high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-5.0467
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " said Erfan .	-2.7598
" You did not fall into the electrical outlets in the walls .	-2.6789
These are important but they don 't play with your heart . "	-2.2031
It shows that an apartment can turn itself into something quite astonishing due to its design and increased square meters .	-5.3586
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-1.7308
Brokers fight for a $ 500 million real estate imperial	-3.1570
Two brothers are located four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a confrontation over one of the largest real estate imperial Victor , worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.6620
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business might be shared .	-5.0558
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp battle over separation took place in the Supreme Court .	-3.4532
Together with her mother Anna , brothers have collected 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since 1973 the family bought a deal in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-3.2294
There , the Westco Jeans family founded and grew up in a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.2868
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .	-1.3216
This money has been invested in real estate , and De Lutis portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , as well as shopping malls in the .	-5.4126
After an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as the " principal manager and the dominant person " in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of the company 's wealth and Paul about a third .	-6.4616
A legal act says that it means that Colin has ownership of $ 316 million , and that Paul is worth $ 176 million .	-4.7056
The distribution of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.6591
" The talks proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidancy .	-4.6002
Last Friday , following several failed mediation , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.1635
The brothers are now also fighting to control the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , excluded him .	-3.7995
Colin argues that this is not true , but it accuses Paul to administer some possessions incompetent .	-4.4217
In an early affect submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-3.6946
" My Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-1.5095
The costs rise in the case , with hundreds of pages of Affidances , E-mails and reports of companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and lawyers held by both sides .	-5.6539
Mrs De Luis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants , who operated dairy bars and delights from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-4.8103
They used the security to buy the Collingwood lounger , where Colin opened the family 's first Jeans .	-5.5640
Colin says that he began to Western co there when he was " High School in my recent years , when Paul was another little child ( approximately 10 years old ) . "	-4.6918
Anna De Luis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property kindly to their sons .	-3.4998
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land to court , " she wrote .	-2.5562
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lucist group , while Colin claims that when leaving the company , Mark paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million .	-4.0600
Both Lukas and Mark have become fiercely poached on the terms of their financial separation .	-4.5267
Colin was very late , although he was a former AFL board member and after a biography from 2015 by Eddie McGuire , the best friend of television stars .	-6.2730
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-2.1138
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I can really not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.3987
" It is very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to drag our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.8603
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-2.4505
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute " , he said and added that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-3.5403
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-1.8654
" In the near future our case will be resolved by the courts " , Colin wrote .	-3.1771
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to curtail the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.6750
Others tried it and failed .	-1.5745
Perhaps John F. Kelly could do so .	-2.0679
If so , he will be the first .	-0.9689
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump – including news media reports – in the hope of holding the boss on an even more modest course .	-4.6652
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.4237
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior staff on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he would like to repair : bad information coming into the hands of the president .	-4.7346
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in postings - because the president would make better choices if he had good information . "	-4.7427
Kelley 's diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media .	-3.2072
President Trump ’ s television relationship dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-3.6380
" When candidate Trump was angry for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of posts to convince , " the former campaign coordinator Sam Nunberg said to Politco in February .	-4.5775
Politos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keep Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a continuous praise . "	-4.3103
Fine .	-0.8492
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been under control is ridiculous .	-2.0068
Perhaps these campaign offices know something we do not know about others - that Trump ’ s tweets , without their interventions , would have included even more breeders .	-5.6455
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.6132
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts were worthwhile .	-4.4499
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump ’ s controversy .	-2.0825
Part of the problem is that in a White House composed of competing parties , people are repeatedly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may help their views from the world .	-4.0104
Politico - quite busy with this story - told in May about the attitude of advisers to give dubious information to the President for strategic reasons .	-5.1355
This was an example described by reporter Shake Goldmacher :	-2.1334
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can react like a volcano on a negative press cut , especially with damaging leaks , and that he knows where they come from .	-5.4239
This is precisely what happened at the end of February , when someone insulted the president in a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the internet provocation Charles C. Johnson , who accused the Deputy Chief of Katie Walsh , " to be the source behind a cluster of leaks " in the White House .	-6.6914
Although Johnson was banned from Twitter on a permanent basis , or that he had not offered any concrete evidence , or that he had previously made false accusations and revoked them .	-5.3875
Trump read the article and started asking people about Welsh . "	-3.3778
Goldmaker added that the then-Chief of Staff Reince Pribus and the White House Secretary-General , Rob Porter , ' tried to implement a system to manage and document the Trump paper ' .	-5.3436
How did it start ?	-2.3939
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .	-1.3092
Perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective manager than Pribus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers still seek influence .	-4.8239
These immovable factors make Kelly 's mission very difficult .	-1.7502

Travellers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millionris ' .	-4.9454
Some of the most prosperous landowners of the West Midlands are back with some determined travelers on war grounds that negotiated a excavation made by the community to demand a field back from their mansions .	-6.1331
Travelers have joined their 20 caravans on a field outside a prosperous Solihull street called the " Millionris " .	-5.9356
They brought together horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out only in May , without being deterred by a ditch issued by the Council to prevent their .	-5.9806
The tactical group found a gap in defense installations and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unimportant to find a way .	-4.2524
Stronger residents have pressed Solihull Council who said that it was useless to deal with the problem .	-6.5603
An anonymous resident said : " You are drawn there on Monday evening after being sent from Bentley Heath , where they put stones on the passers-by .	-5.8477
The Council must indeed be forced by shame to implement it , because it was useless to deal with the problem .	-4.1871
Travelers were there in May , were moved and are now back .	-2.0556
More came yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.5177
They added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long outings to protect its parks .	-4.6400
I live on Streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop that . '	-2.8757
A native who did not want to be named said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers just to be plundered by another round .	-5.8838
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . '	-3.9888
A spokesperson of the Solihull Council said : " We are aware of an unrestrained camp on the land beyond the Streetbrook Road and work with the police of Solihouls .	-6.3165
To support our collection of evidence it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling for 101 .	-3.9710
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court must examine when we present our case . '	-4.1441
Out of Birkenhof woods Hotel Luise	-3.7155
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise becomes .	-4.0312
The house at the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.1872
This is good news for the city .	-2.0773
After all , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof on April 13 , 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays were lost each year and income from the courier tax .	-7.1312
In the autumn of 2014 , given dramatically rising numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel was offered to the Council of Ministers as a list of accommodation , which provided for controversial discussions .	-6.5772
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to safeguard the area as a hotel location .	-4.1325
At that time , the decision was not uncontroversial in the municipal council .	-3.6111
However , especially Freudenst 's Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and talked about the serious guest at the time .	-7.2452
He should be right to keep .	-2.1516
The Luisenhotels group with director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzaer , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof with a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to turn it into a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-7.7357
The group has four houses with the happy object .	-2.6471
Two of them in Bad Bergzaer and one in Bad Herralbad .	-4.3219
You like Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-3.6350
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time and , if you enter the house , it will be clear how extensive renovation works will be carried out .	-6.7354
Soak floors , partially covered ceilings , ancient baths removed from the rooms .	-6.5513
The entire hotel building is a single construction site .	-2.4467
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.7626
" It is actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer talking to our newspaper .	-3.5109
Everything has to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.9603
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is changed , new windows are installed .	-4.1004
Everything should be " nice to the people " , as Thomas Scherer says .	-4.5773
" We want to make a filthy " .	-3.2513
Swimming pool , spa and a meeting room are also included .	-3.7183
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.8292
The Waldhotel Luise , with some 60 rooms , wants to stand up , explains Scherer .	-6.1288
Both individual holidaymakers , groups and business people should feel at home .	-3.3075
Discussions with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause have already led , weiter .	-3.8093
The city 's ideas are identical to those of the hotel group .	-3.0074
" We are on the same line . "	-1.3465
As investment levels demand , Thomas Scherer does not want to lay down exactly .	-4.6452
Knapp below one million euros , he expects .	-3.0071
The outdoor facilities are also put on the front , which is already clearly visible .	-5.2865
In the inner courtyard a large terrace is created which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is open .	-4.7190
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstt is a good market " .	-2.9893
Russian affair : United States Special Orders set up Grand Jury	-4.5553
In the Russian affair at US President Donald Trump , special counsel Robert Mueller is said to have set up a so-called Grand jury after a report .	-4.9048
The body has begun work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " , based on the cause of confidential persons .	-4.8082
The newspaper regarded the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations .	-3.0615
The CNN channel reported that there are already first subpoenas associated with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.2296
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of meddling in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-4.9392
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.4100
The investigation should focus on several men who spoke in the Republican campaign .	-3.9718
According to reports , Mueller has also been increasingly monitoring Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.7747
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Envoy Trump has come to the fore personally and is criticising whether the President might have obstructed justice in the course of the affair .	-6.3789
The main task of Grand Jurys is to check this evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether or not to receive charges .	-4.6468
Grand Jurys are therefore also called the anchor chambers .	-4.1512
By the way , they are often turned on when there are major and controversial cases .	-3.5889
The procedure is always conducted behind closed doors .	-1.5655
The board can also be activated by the public prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under egg .	-4.3227
According to the CNN channel , preliminary charges concerning the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer have already been issued .	-3.4908
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement in the report .	-3.3358
They should also provide documents .	-0.9352
In addition to Trump , Mr. Jr. was also Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law Jared Kushner , as well as his director of campaign Paul Manafort , in .	-6.0666
Legal experts said on Thursday night TV that the appointment of Mueller is not a smokescreen in his work and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .	-6.5345
However , it does not necessarily mean that the Grand jury will be activated in the end to decide on the charge .	-5.2198
Nevertheless , setting up a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern for President Trump is a matter of concern .	-4.4615
In the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the President used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.2067
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-2.2832
The subject gives the Democrats a way to " feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about " .	-3.7809
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand jury .	-3.8777
These work also usually work in secret , he pointed .	-2.9714
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the special employer in a ' fair ' way .	-4.4717
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that he was not appointed against the president .	-2.9334
There is no reason to think that this has changed , it was said in the statement .	-5.0912
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey .	-2.3267
Because of this stronghold , charges against Trump have become apparent , he has tried to obstruct justice .	-5.9127
Comey told a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser , Michael Flynn .	-3.3899
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.3675
Following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the special employee and his staff .	-4.3456
Revolving Trump ’ s wish to sack Mueller was a spurring of speculation .	-5.2426
In contrast to an independent congressional special envoy , such as the Watergate affair around President Richard Nixon , who later retired President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could potentially be fired at the request of the President of the Ministry of Justice .	-7.2666
Several senators of both parties want to take such a step , however .	-3.0893
Two groups of republican and democratic senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that would no longer be easy to dismiss the special envoy .	-4.6058
Antarctica : Gigantic Eisberg is driving in the Antarctica .	-2.7340
In the West Antarctic , a giant iceberg of the Berlin Schelfeis has been removed from the Schelfeis just under seven times .	-8.3196
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research was awarded on Wednesday .	-7.0158
The more than one trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometers of Kolos are now driving to the north , probably going to take two or three years to molten .	-6.3316
It is a width of up to 50 kilometres and is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades .	-4.5249
He is not at risk to people .	-3.0966
The extent to which climate change has played a role in anchoring the iceberg is unclear according to research evidence .	-4.5616
However , for some 30 years , there has been a series of unusual implosions in the region of ice shearing , writes the US Research Centre for snow and ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-5.7690
Many researchers believe that global warming can be related to global warming .	-2.7599
The now broken pistos has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-4.1698
Schelfeis swim on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-4.1227
Thus , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .	-3.4757
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is situated south of South America at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula .	-3.4744
Northern this buff was disrupted the balance of guards and collapses a few years ago .	-5.0260
A complete scheme is broken down there , writes AWI-Fparenthelen Daniela Jansen .	-6.4621
It is important that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also at risk , because the front edge edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-6.0689
Moreover , the ice plate is standing under tension and could fall apart if at a key point some pieces break away .	-6.9224
The melting of Schelfeis and iceberg does not increase sea levels , as they swim on the water and ice releases as much water as it does after melting .	-6.0495
However , the loss of the Schelfeus results in the glaciers entering the sea straight and can flow much faster than before .	-5.1805
That could perhaps increase sea levels , but little , writes the British research project to monitor the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-5.5480
The Larsen-C-Scheldfeis , according to AWE , with almost 50 000 square kilometres , is the fourth largest slab of Antarctica .	-5.4278
It is up to 700 metres thick on the front edge to the free ocean .	-4.8242
There it collapses regularly .	-2.7047
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct connection to climate change , the ice sign is now coming into a dangerous position " , said Martin O 'Learn from the British Swansea University .	-5.2027
" This is the longest retreat since the records began " , he also confirmed .	-3.7200
Scientists have been controversial as to whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeus will grow again or will go back in the long term , and perhaps fall together , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , and added , ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-8.0238
But this development will last decades .	-1.9220
Although these researchers do not reverse the collapse of this gigantic iceberg on climate change , in recent decades there have been a great many catchwork of the Antarctic peninsula .	-7.0813
This long landscape of Antarctic waters stretches from South America .	-4.6328
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice area of the Antarctic peninsula has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950 ’ s .	-3.5722
The decline in temperature growth has contributed .	-1.8473
Over the last 50 years , the Antarctic peninsula has been heating about three degrees and thus counting on the areas where the temperature is most rapidly rising .	-6.4890
CDU wants a pet at the staff	-6.2373
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy vacant positions , the CDU calls for the employers ’ association to become more attractive .	-4.5363
It was only just before the summer break that the circular day had given 41 new places in the administration .	-4.9978
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the council in Mettmann .	-2.0911
Once again , 17 apprentices have completed their first working day .	-3.4221
Apparently the teachers around the circle are very much sought-after .	-4.0779
Some 620 applications were present for the seats to be lost this year .	-3.4059
However , the circle still lacks personnel to cope with increased requirements and tasks .	-4.7510
At the moment there are still 50 non-occupied posts in the Mettmann circle .	-3.6271
Amongst other things , doctors and engineers and forces in general administration are reported .	-3.7306
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG at the round day and oppose the need for skilled labour in administration .	-5.6269
According to the parties ' wishes , the administration should ' draft a concept for recruitment and personnel development ' .	-5.4751
The aim is not only to cover short-term standards to professionals but to counter the forward-looking nature of the shortage of applicants , that is to .	-5.8630
The overall concept should be directed internally and externally , to show concrete measures for groupers and to include a training offensive , calls for CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.9449
That sounds like a good approach .	-1.9917
The circle has to do with personnel problems that were not known before .	-3.9580
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.9234
The speech is about a genuine ' competition for public employers ' .	-2.9938
In addition , there is a large number of people leaving out of service who are sick or aged .	-4.8577
So it is high time to act , so that no more posts remain vacant .	-5.3193
But Klaus-Dietrer peoples , the leader of the CDU , still goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-5.2107
He recently held a wretched surprise at the round day when he publicly questioned personnel coverage and stunned the other parties .	-6.7925
People want to see all the possibilities available for withdrawal from the community employers ' association .	-4.7779
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the cogent cities - should aspire to a pet , " so people .	-6.9378
Thus , the CDU , employees , and officials are trying to pay better than actually provides the public service tariff arrangement .	-5.2092
The salaries currently exist exactly , and there are only increases or more money if you change to a higher level directed to professional years .	-5.3767
But the agendas have grown more and more in recent years .	-2.6916
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees took care of the provisions of the new Procurement Act .	-5.0563
Last but not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , LandCouncil Thomas Hendele and Speaker Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-7.1451
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO ’ s migrant rescues	-2.9678
Italy has warned NGOs engaged in a bail-out for migrants in the Mediterranean that they must not continue if they do not abide by new rules for their operations .	-4.9781
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " Secretary of State Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-3.2167
Minnitis ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German Liberation Association , because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.5437
The aid organization which has only been in operation for one year refused to comment on detailed accusations of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-5.6596
" For us , and it remains our top priority to save human life , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media . the are and .	-11.1347
" We can only judge all the allegations that are being made after we have gathered all the information and assess the situation . "	-4.6588
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of ' Youth rescued ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.8396
It is suspected that his crew will take vessel vessel vessel vessel vessel vessel vessel supplies directly from human traffickers and that smugglers can go off so that ships can be used again .	-6.5910
At least such a meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Public Prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.6828
The occupation is suspected of overturning the authority of the Italian coast guard , monitoring the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-3.6670
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuventa must have above all an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-3.6192
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro Open Arms from Spain .	-2.6192
On Thursday , the latter said that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not entail ' substantial changes or obstacles ' in their bailouts .	-4.6020
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Laureater Organization is doctors without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.8825
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the bailouts in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.4318
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the minister said .	-2.2315
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.7130
Wacking and Trials	-2.5995
Nine Weimar bikers , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guests met in Wachaenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy four days of Trials and sights .	-5.6306
For this , three friendly guides were available .	-3.0425
Accommodation in the Wadden Valley has proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.9682
The Castle and Wine Festival of Wachaenheim was a welcome extra .	-3.2224
The first tour guided the Michaele chapel above Deidesheim during hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-4.6817
It followed viewpoints , sometimes on towers , from which one could look far beyond the lard forest and the forested plains .	-7.2769
In between , there was always longer growth for which long trials could inhabit .	-5.1786
The second day we went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Volksfest Wurstmarkt .	-4.8387
Again a vantage point , connected by " flow " Trials and moderate climbs .	-5.5257
On the last two days we were again surrounded by a lot of hills .	-5.4880
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and shelters brought welcome breaks .	-3.4012
In Bad Dürkheim the bikes used in outdoor salt salt salt salt are used . the of and are .	-11.1733
New town has also been invested .	-3.9287
After 173 kilometres and nearly 4500 metres of altitude , the group had learned the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .	-4.7276
Bundesliga : Bundesliga : Bundesliga competition for e-Sport .	-7.0445
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of a computer console rather than sitting out over the stadiums for wind and weather ?	-6.6569
The fact is that e-sport has become a serious industry and has become a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gags .	-5.2358
This was also evident from the first federal leagues that are increasingly engaged in this area .	-5.8005
The VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015 , later the FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart founded an e-sports department in mid-July and took two pros under contract for the computer game FIFA 17 .	-6.3010
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB " , says Executive Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.5766
He is sure " that there are still several clubs on this train " .	-4.1302
This weekend , FIFA World Cup will be hosting the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in London , where players from different clubs compete .	-6.1534
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-3.1156
Robin Duttt also sees great potential in e-Sport .	-4.4743
The ex-coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werner Bremen is now planning an agency for virtual football players .	-3.3609
" Real football must , in particular , deal with the 14 to thirty years old , that young people still go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-6.1522
And : the clubs tried to conquer all the possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.6889
With prominent e-athletes under contract , one could be present on these markets more online than just once a year to send the federal Lighthouse to Asia .	-6.6131
What exactly is at issue here ?	-2.2034
In e-Sport , computer games like " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterspike " or even the football simulation FIFA are challenged at competitive level .	-4.1381
The length of the exercise , as in normal sport , has been established by leagues in which the professionals compete .	-7.1419
And in the 2022 Asian Games E-Sport is already part of the official programme .	-2.0780
But is this a true sport ?	-2.0886
For many people the idea is certainly a necessity to get used .	-5.0053
Ingo Froevil also looked into the question for a long time .	-3.2243
For the professor at the German School of Sports in Cologne E-Sport is a sport because he is competitive and many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rate , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.8602
In addition , it requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability .	-3.3729
Professional gamers should train not only on the console , but also on their body and watch the nutrition .	-3.7792
" The game is a good player . "	-2.0597
Froevil also sees problems : " doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-4.0628
Control on online games was difficult to carry out , and the structures of classic sport were absent in the scene .	-4.8703
The scientists stress the high integrative impact of e-sports .	-2.9280
Players are on the international stage , like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.4403
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive entertainment software ( BIU ) says that e-sport requires rapid growth .	-4.9432
In 2016 , it implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and major tournaments .	-3.7726
In three years the turnover will be 130 million .	-3.7354
This is a little counter to the EUR 2.4 billion allocated to the football league .	-5.4709
However , E-Sport " is no longer far away from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , write the deloite consultants .	-4.5290
Internationally , many countries are already on track .	-3.0898
Large markets are Asia and the US , where ex-ball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez are participating in the US team NRG eSports .	-4.0756
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unirn .	-2.7124
There is something in Europe , too .	-3.3213
In a Norwegian school e-sport has been introduced as a teaching compartment , says Froevil .	-3.1594
In the Netherlands and in France , according to Dutch law , football first dues have become obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-4.8704
" When Germany lags behind , " says VfB Board Röttgermann .	-3.7026
It is not enough today to make a dent in nostalgia and to make friends with the old times .	-5.7727
It is important to preserve the tradition of the association , but also to align the company with the modern market .	-3.9174
" We live in a digitalised world " , says Duvet .	-3.7648
" That 's not to say that only in football , everything remains as it was always . "	-6.1735
Gift eggs - The egg options for cooking and baking	-4.4448
Eggs have now been hit by the scandal of poisoned eggs .	-5.4202
Aldi Sud and Aldi Nord have responded and taken all the eggs out of the sale in Germany .	-3.5563
Only eggs should be taken into the shelves that have demonstrably no fipronil .	-5.7064
Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that press Conrad Roy to suicide .	-3.6251
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by writing and calling for suicide .	-3.7453
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her sentence behind bars and five years have been exposed to radiation .	-3.9632
Carter was convicted in June for forced killing Conrad Roy , who took his life on July 13 , 2014 .	-3.5931
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is unrealistic .	-2.6873
My son was my best friend . '	-0.8131
Carter was allowed to remain free until appeal .	-2.7546
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representative argued that both her and Mr Roy suffered from mental illness .	-3.3818
Carter was dressed in red trousers and a creamy blue , with tears in his eyes , with cuddled hands and down-facing eyes when she was convicted .	-6.0981
" Her actions have been directed by Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutors to the court .	-4.4396
" She ended his life in order to make her own better .	-2.5768
She did not accept any responsibility , " she said .	-2.6756
" She did not show any kind of repentance " .	-3.1595
But Carter ’ s lawyer said that it is a “ terrible fact that she is totally sorry . ”	-5.9419
However , Judge Lawrence Moniz said that he did not find that their " age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant influence on their actions " .	-4.5494
A prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy who said that there was ' no day in which I did not see the loss of my beloved son .	-3.8438
I would like him to be proud of me and how I walk with everything .	-4.0912
Roy ’ s sister , Camdyn Roy , said that they would be " persecuted " by the realization that they would never participate in the marriage of their brother or be a contour for his children .	-5.0054
" Not more to have this single person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life " , she said .	-7.7589
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-3.2747
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead of a carbon monoxide exploration exploration in a vehicle in 2014 .	-3.4209
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s textual communications revealed that it encouraged him to end his life .	-4.9822
" Mount up , jumping from a building , build yourself , I do not know there are many ways " , she said in several news she had sent her in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.4724
In the eye of his suicide she wrote : " You have to do so , Conrad " and " All you have to do is turn the generator on and you will be free and happy " .	-4.3365
Judge Moniz said that Carrer was looking for attention through the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case by any press .	-3.7948
The case has divided legal opinion .	-1.3995
One of the few people who defended Carter was Amanda Knix , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder on her British co-operative in Italy before being acquitted two years ago .	-5.3013
Mrs Knix , 30 years old , published a comment at Los Angeles Times : " Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . "	-3.4497
Joshua Kimmich : Learn about the new mini Lahm of the FC Bayern .	-2.6851
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was born at the Audi Cup as a captain is no accident .	-4.0690
The FC Bayern is expecting the Confed-Cup winner a great season - extra motivation does not apply here .	-5.7993
Somewhat was different in his seat in the cabin , that was Joshua Kimmich immediately , even though the extra dress was very small .	-4.7815
Of course , as far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , he was not a Philipp Lahm , nor a Manuel Neuer , he made the bond with him in the arm .	-6.9793
" The trainer did not announce it " , the Confed-Cup winner explained afterwards , after his first use as a Bayern-Hunter .	-6.7138
Well , the stick could have run better than with the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.6274
But Kim also made the character of the Coach .	-8.2127
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player-in-player , as well as a player-maker , and especially from the holiday experienced professionals .	-9.0418
sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep a lot of confidence in it .	-6.9323
So anyone who has been trying to enlist the legacy of Lahm can only use a small additional motivation well .	-5.3442
Kimerich confirmed : " That is what you , as a player , want to assume responsibility . "	-4.5481
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old man flew through the field as a mini Lahm .	-4.2152
To the back , that is now his position , the white bound of the arm did the rest .	-3.0985
And Kimmich felt at all in this starting information like the one who could take the hat in the best way .	-8.3408
He gave instructions , tried to direct the unplayed troops .	-2.1723
He had a look at the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .	-4.8734
Vidal thereby overplaying his lack of fitness ( clapping little ) ; Renato Sanches by climbing on Devil komm to the services of the Asian journey ( clapping also limited ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Swale do not drop negative in their first appearance at the Bayern-Trikot .	-8.5315
That , after all , was a very good thing .	-2.5769
Apart from the puppy , Rudy ran against the defense , both were sovereign .	-6.1613
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult , and Swle also tried to succeed a few times during the formation of the .	-5.8887
Mr Rudy admitted that the result ' was not the way we hoped for it to be .	-4.0397
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut .	-2.2002
Kicking , Tempowechsel : " I was also brought up for this style .	-7.2708
The degree to which this Bayern world is still remaining for the new , was seen after the party .	-7.1117
Rudy , for example , gave not one or two in the catacombs , but six or seven interviews .	-7.3483
Kimmich finally finished a small count on his new player .	-7.1385
There he heard an interesting phrase from True : " What is happening here , I have already noticed .	-5.3415
At Bavaria , you just have to win every game " .	-2.9056
After all , he no longer needs to bring this to the new .	-3.8999
Alba motivated ÖFB Ladies	-3.6724
David Alabba believes in the success of our ÖB Ladies	-6.4927
Austria ’ s most well-known football player reported on Twitter shortly before the game and wanted the ÖFB ladies all the best .	-9.4027
The Bayern-Legionist is actually a club member of the ÖFB chapter in Schnaderbeck and has settled with our Ladys .	-6.7646
The tweet of the Austrian football player of the year and the champagne winner should be a special shot of motivation .	-4.3116
Perhaps our ladies could also need the famous Bayern clause .	-3.7649
Businesses satisfied with a patchwork ministers : business praised Wissen ’ s pace .	-5.3903
It has often been implausible , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Greens ) was still Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-4.6639
That shows more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-4.3617
Chambers and companies from the region talk to T V-enquiry about a change in economic policy - at the same time , the old Minister .	-5.7091
Frank Natus , chairman of the Trier company ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing attacks the wishes of the economy , which has all blocked Lemke " .	-4.6949
NATO 's biggest U-turn is in infrastructure policy : the climax of the 1 motorway between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country 's priorities .	-5.7515
Even this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning process , until 2021 is supposed to be the right of construction .	-5.3076
A role in the country 's plans is also played by the West circumvention Trier , which is in the immediate need of the Federal Transport Agency .	-5.8396
The aim is to take the route into operation in December 2020 , Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.6291
NATO sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.3775
The Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , aims at producing a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase the sales in supermarkets and to halt the trend of German wine exports , which have been sucking for ten years .	-6.3998
Moreover , Wissing did an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , IHK praised .	-4.7867
The Trier Handhold holds an additional incentive for young apprentices in the new master hall , says Matthias Schwalbach .	-4.9522
Vorseen is a prize of € 1000 for the attending master exam and € 2500 , when graduates are self-sufficient within ten years of master training .	-8.0204
But the country ’ s house fee list remains long .	-3.9400
The planned construction of the road is quick to create facts , but at the same time it lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , chief executive of the IHK Trier .	-6.1280
Of 56 new engineers trying to adapt Wissing to local mobility , 29 positions have been occupy until now .	-6.3365
The IHK is asking for more orders at external offices .	-3.9358
The CDU group vize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors , which invest more than EUR 20 million in the preservation of inland roads in 2017 and 2018 .	-4.2871
Frank Natus also expects a country concept to address shortages in the region .	-3.4379
Moreover , growing broadband in the country up to now should be sobering .	-4.6707

Audi is going to change 850,000 diesel cars - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-4.4753
A day before the announcement of Audi , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.8744
The BMW chair said that the company believed that ' there are smarter options as restrictions on travel ' , referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based , to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-5.7133
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.3303
None of the companies described the companies as a callback .	-3.0181
European car manufacturers have promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-3.4153
But nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered to be carcinogenic and can cause asthma .	-2.7438
The cost of car manufacturers , installations for neutralising diesel vehicles , is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep cars competitive .	-4.8899
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with ignoring powerful car companies and signs of the problem .	-2.7936
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called end-of-life appliances to comply with the regulations when a car has been tested but will return to normal driving conditions .	-6.3326
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.4508
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the Audi engine development in Germany .	-2.0176
Former manager , Zacceo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States .	-3.7344
At the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the Audi authorities accused of having installed a system to circumvent the emission regulations in Europe , and a question concentrated on the United States has been expanded .	-5.0998
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could be a heavy burden : the luxury car manufacturer is over-proportional to the profits of Volkswagen .	-5.6754
The message on Saturday at the Isar	-3.1930
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-2.6560
In order to join the Isar-Bucher , a meeting will take place tomorrow Saturday in Munich , which has a special message .	-6.2753
Once again , head to the Isar on Saturday , where the Flucher and ReichenachBrücke see a big fless .	-7.6177
And that is no ordinary lunch , with Isar tourists .	-3.9843

The motto " True Love is ... " is to increase understanding for the Isar as a protective flow .	-4.3421
Last summer , the talk about the Isar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve a considerate and environmentally conscious attitude .	-6.5689
Mordilos Knoll and Laughter against the suffering	-4.5992
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most released cartoon markers , the key names of his figures are his trademark .	-4.5160
Also with 85 , Argentineans still paints and works on a film .	-3.1112
His message : salmon , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.9163
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.7147
In his first years as an artist he proposed himself as a drawing for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-4.7669
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he said once .	-2.3265
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he achieved his breakthrough at the end of the 1960s : with the release of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.5056
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-1.9488
Every time the artists inspired cities .	-3.5736
Large , round Mordillo figures rumbled in drawings with the slap tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-6.7879
In the early morning , according to his own indications , he is still sitting in the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-3.9925
Through calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , T-shirts , plings and watches , its droplet figures continue to be widely used around the world .	-5.5365
He also worked on a sample film and a TV series with his characters for six years .	-3.5924
The main man in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordilos popular animal in his drawings - which has one thousand feet as a counter player .	-3.9869
His figures speak for the first time in 3D film , which is to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .	-4.7642
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me " , says Mordillo .	-1.9254
The script will not be written by him .	-1.3473
This is why he is concentrating more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without a word .	-5.9740
Lavender from Provence threatened with climate change .	-2.3540
He has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that he is threatened by climate change .	-2.6129
The lavender is falling because of droughts and illnesses , which causes great headache for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.7074
Eric Chaisse , expert in the field of agro-research of the CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change , which has caused much less rainfall in the spring , and much more so in the autumn .	-6.8871
This has implications for the lifetime of Lavender .	-2.9574
There is also a small zipper , a microbacterium , which transfers dwarves , and in a dry climate there are many of them . '	-6.3928
And the stakes are high .	-2.1740
Don 't miss this opportunity to visit the famous Trevi Fountain .	-8.0194
Eric Chaisse said : ' Instead of having a long vegetable oven with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under-developed and either missing or weakened .	-7.2006
So we have less parts with essential oil . '	-2.3703
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and dilution of desolation from the ground , but also the spray of plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to drought .	-6.0228
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year-old existence .	-2.5232
This Saturday and Sunday with an average age is fixed .	-2.7191
These days , storm , ignition , trader , vagabond or a sailor are to be present in the city centre .	-12.4874
The murder of a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-1.8564
The workers of the Riodoce weekly newspaper usually meet in order to review their plans for reporting the recent Sinaloa disaster through organised crime , corrupt officials , and inconsiderable drug wars .	-4.7936
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.4711
They have been informed that it is important to change their routine .	-2.6242
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should put their children in office , which were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.1087
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponent , neutral , ally .	-2.6774
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is needed , perceptions and structure rich .	-3.8248
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s salary list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals that are dangerous to the chaos of Mexico .	-4.3624
There is no respite from violence , and while the corpses are spreading throughout the country , more and more journalists have been involved : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nito took office in December 2012 , 589 , after attacks and threats under federal protection , and up to now , there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-6.4818
Among the latter is the editor and their inspiration of Riodoce , the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-4.2630
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " he wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .	-3.1382
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , showing his mid-finger at the word " Justice " , hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-6.6312
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death , and the reporters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their Alpine dream , insomnia , paranoia .	-3.3562
Although a special federal attorney was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , she has only instituted two criminal proceedings .	-6.1043
As with most thousands of deaths each year linked to drug trafficking and organised crime , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to court .	-7.1589
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , although they are not neutral and even though the terrain is more subteric .	-6.3142
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting on security has little benefit , Ibarra says .	-2.5354
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop " he says .	-1.4146
" As long as we do not know why , we all dare . "	-3.0511
In the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan .	-3.4128
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his roter Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , being forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated with the " Zwölfter River " .	-6.6692
The shooter went away in his car and damaged it near .	-4.4500
Valdez was 50 years old .	-2.7513
He left a woman and two adult children .	-0.8430
Rumours tend to lie freely in Culiacan .	-2.5395
But there is virtually no silence on the subject of Valdez .	-3.8130
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-2.9709
It doesn ’ t matter that somebody or more people are shot in the street every day in Sinaloa , or that the graveyard is full of decorated , twin-story mausoleen for drug-queen , larger than many houses for the living .	-6.6534
Forget for one minute that there is a state of tranquility if only a cartel has control over the coastal state , with its valuable ports and drug routes to the United States .	-4.6509
Despite this , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojoquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is to blame for not being able to protect his friend .	-4.8623
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.8103
First , in February , the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartels in war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.9294
This publication may have angered the sons , suggesting gang members bought every copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-9.0451
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to depart from his own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that published the same story .	-4.6787
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-3.3013
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues believed that he would always be there .	-3.8380
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $ 50 to participate .	-4.6716
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to practise journalism without getting into the problem of narcotics , " said Bojoquez .	-4.5595
Over time , the newspaper had a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising .	-4.0688
Reporters loved to publish harsh examinations without fear of censorship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to handle .	-3.8310
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her report in Latin America .	-3.0734
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-3.9611
He admitted voluntarily that he had fear .	-2.0850
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.1343
The drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Romentiero TV .	-4.5183
" You must assume the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the Duma .	-3.8641
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.0594
The Rio team missed Valdez , the Spatial Mountains , who could flood like a port worker , the friend who was generous with reliefs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-7.3342
They kept their communications on their routine .	-2.8922
It would always carry his hat .	-2.9319
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar facing the office , and always sit at the same table .	-3.1874
Now they ask : Was his love to routine be his ruin ?	-3.7102
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their job and remain alive .	-6.0265
" They don 't like it when you look at their women , their children , their clean shops , their hidden runways and landing lanes " to move drugs .	-5.6711
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojojorquez .	-3.5046
The result , even in the best times , is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-1.4771
We trust our own instincts .	-2.5929
If it sounds wrong , stay away from it .	-2.3697
The trouble , the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that ' smells a sense that can be cheated ... and then the matter happened to Javier . '	-4.1851
The old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is home .	-4.5377
The landscape is changing constantly .	-1.5222
In the space in which the Ridice staff met for security training , suddenly no mobile phones were allowed , and days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.8775
In the shadow of a tree , two police officers sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) .	-3.5602
They were instructed by the local government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class district of Culiacan .	-3.6454
Half in Scherz , some of the reporters asked whether these officers were among the 50 % of the policemen , who the governor himself called untrustworthy .	-7.4492
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape , where the drug gangs are effectively under control .	-4.2292
For this week 's issue , Riodoce has clicked on three main stories .	-3.7847
The assassination of the former boxer , Julio Cesar Chavez , was carried out in Sinaloa .	-2.9428
They also had an Exposé to government spending that focused on the capital of the governor .	-3.5092
And there was a group that broke out in one of the costliest restaurants in Culiacan , one block from the Public Prosecutor 's Office .	-3.3915
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened , so caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite locally from drug dealers and authorities .	-4.4636
A reporter learned from public record that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who listened to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which ruled almost all political levels in almost the entire century .	-5.2199
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption for charges of high caliber cases .	-3.3377
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this place , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman degenerated a military takeover .	-4.4892
Only a few months before , the readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the best informed source of the abduction .	-5.3606
" Previously we had known what happened " , said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flamo " because of its slim body body body body body body body body body body body body .	-4.6871
" Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . "	-2.4328
The office of Valdez was moved to the storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists , because employees have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.0777
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and took a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the Public Prosecutor Office .	-4.3677
Salvador Adams disappeared three days after Valdez was killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-3.5477
A burned body was discovered and civil servants say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-3.6513
Throughout the country , journalists have become louder by writing in organised protests " SOS Press " on salaries and buildings .	-3.6212
On that day , the director , Bogotez , is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for justice in the case of Valdez .	-5.9267
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities to spy out journalists and kill them because they said the truth .	-4.7758
Since then , she has been asked to reassert her word from the government because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-5.0421
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved and an equal society " .	-4.4566
In his last book , " Narco-Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces who were covered by organised crimes .	-4.0910
The Articulo 19 media guard group assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials last year .	-3.6952
" In Mexico except you because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-3.1895
Evidently , the killings have a deterrent effect .	-2.2522
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-3.3040
Her body was found along with a note that was allegedly signed by the Zetas-Kartel : ' I am here because of my reports ' .	-3.6041
A computer key and headphones lay next to their disconnected head .	-3.4502
Some branches have chosen to close , as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua following the assassination of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.4109
Others continue to do as El Manana did by Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-3.8048
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drugs cartels with a editorial on the front page entitled " What do you want from us ? "	-4.4042
Some journalists have fled from their home states , or even from the country .	-1.7467
It is a painful decision .	-0.6983
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-3.8412
And sometimes they are driven , as it seems to be the photographer of Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015 , along with four women in an apartment in Mexico City .	-4.6053
For those who stay behind and continue work , it is an everyday dance with risky decisions .	-3.5965
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking kills him .	-3.5450
" Mexico is going to hell , so I was reporter , " he said .	-2.8507
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was finished , the editors of Riodoce appeared on the town-platform in front of the office and the bars of beer when all their phones started to throw .	-6.9876
A number of shafts with gang rival and security forces near Mazatlan , had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-4.2742
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a series of carton messages in the region .	-3.1147
They published news on the Riodoce website from the Bordeaux cants .	-4.8993
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.3003
Sirenen was close to Sirene this year - another shooting in the area .	-5.7695
Bojoquez faced a glance at the police who kept watchmen to see if they were willing .	-5.1000
If they were really afraid , they did not .	-3.5933
Under the huge portrait of the newspaper ’ s fallen founder , whose midfinger was visible for all Sinaloa , Riodoce ’ s employees followed his tracks .	-6.4855
" How can you only think of closing it , " said Bojoquez , " if on the same day when Javier was murdered , the practitioner asked me to send them to the street to report . "	-6.1781
Dinosaurs used the camouflage to soften his enemies .	-2.6125
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening .	-1.6580
Now researchers have found that the first insights of the incredible Nashorns of a Canadian mountain workers have been received so well that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.9186
It was so good that they even found that his scaly skin of Roman Braun was - and they said that it had something of a " calm past " .	-5.9752
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " described him as " the best preserved quilted dinosaur ever found and one of the best Dinosaurs in the world " .	-5.2923
The Fossil is a newly discovered species of Nodosauer living in the middle of the Cretaceage between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-5.0021
His incredibly well preserved state of affairs has stunned researchers who describe it as " remarkable " .	-3.9682
According to reports in National Geographic , the fastened plant freer is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-4.3090
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was in Suncor Millenium mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub on 21 March 2011 .	-3.3388
He met something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rocks and decided to see more closely .	-4.6379
He discovered Fossil in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.2216
They spent the next six years investigating the wild animal within <unk> 2,500 ( 1,100 kg ) .	-4.7312
After all this hard work , the final result is ready to be revealed .	-2.3170
" If you blink only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe it has slept , " said the main figure Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to see .	-5.2195
" The Mona Lisa of Dinosaurrien is going to be one of the most beautiful and best-preserved Dinosauriers - " .	-5.5856
Researchers found that , although covered with a armor and similar tanks , this plant freer was likely to be threatened by meat loosening dinosaurs .	-5.9946
The highly concentrated dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide from the predators , and used a technique of deirration known as counter-insurgency , which is also used by many modern animals .	-6.6821
This would have allowed him to mix more closely and make his enemies softly , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-7.6917
The 110 million old creature from the Nodosauer family made headlines in May for the first time and is now on the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-3.9509
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta marktelli after the museum technicians Mark Mitchell , one of a team who has spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-4.9742
The amazing conservation of the example allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the shape of scales and armour over his body .	-4.6266
They discovered the concteration , a common animal defense method , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-4.1730
Although the concteration is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today .	-4.3911
It suggests that the dinosaur has been driven by enough pressure from the meat of evil beasts that evolution has benefited from the wear of confrontation as a means of survival .	-5.6041
But most contemporary animals that use the concteration - think of deer , zebra , and belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot , which signaled that this nodosauer had been subjected to a real battle of survival .	-7.9329
" Strong predatory behaviour on a massive , heavily concentrated dinosaurs show how dangerous the dinosaur predators had to have been the Cretaceous predators " , said Brown .	-6.3627
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of dinosaur was rotten .	-2.3067
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of his life , including his protected intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-4.6271
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was gone into a river and driven to the sea , where he fell to the seabed on the back .	-4.7430
At that time , Alberta was as warm as southern flora today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-3.1998
" This nostalgic is really remarkable because it is fully covered with a glass of red , but also kept in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-6.3979
" The result is that the animal today looks almost the same as in the early period of creation .	-2.8300
You don 't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just flash a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it is in the sleeping room . "	-5.8385
The period of creation was a time when a huge thermal baths , the carnivorous dinosaur faced two legs through the earth .	-6.3051
Although the king of them living in the Tyrannosaurus Rex , millions of years after Borealopelta , the fainted dinosaur was driven by some of his terrifying ancestral .	-4.4050
These include the acrobatics , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-3.9894
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was deceived after death in the sea and was mified in the mud .	-5.2862
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was in Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub on 21 March 2011 .	-3.2558
According to the museum it is the cultivated dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the snout to the hips .	-4.5391
The creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long , reaching <unk> 3.000 ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.1933
It had two 20-inch long peaks that were raised by his shoulders .	-3.2885
The researchers believe that the patched herbivores were swept through the Western Canada until a flood of river flooded it into the open sea .	-5.3757
But the underwater attestation of dinosaur kept its armor in exceptional detail .	-3.8903
The hidden remains of this particular example are preserved so well that the remains of the skin still cover haunted tank plates along the dinosaur .	-5.1139
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the Lotto .	-3.1039
The more I see it , the more puzzling it .	-1.8196
Hidden remains of the skin still cover the outdated armour plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-5.0868
Its foreground is on its side , its five fingers are stretched upwards .	-3.6976
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.7210
In a thunder : bulk bargains on A8 : Many injured	-6.9076
A massive no-smoking accident on Thursday nights at the A8 : Knapp 30 vehicles is involved in a mass cartel .	-5.2525
There are numerous casualties , miles of congestion and cases .	-4.0410
On the night of Thursday afternoons at a mass cartel in Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass car.	-5.6893
According to the police ’ s first data , about 5 p.m. , between the connections of Adelzhen and Odelzhausen ( county Aichach-Friedberg ) , during a thunder of almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , .	-8.9787
There was no information on the precise number of casualties .	-3.5290
It is a case of slight to medium serious injuries , a police speaker said .	-4.9148
A large number of rescue vehicles were found at the accident site .	-3.8019
The A8 was completely closed to Munich .	-1.9396
There was a backlog of about 10 kilometers in the direction of Munich .	-6.9901
As one AZZ reporter reports , there were also massive impediment on the antithesis train - through numerous cases .	-6.9117
The fire brigades listed the markers of the vehicle drivers who now have to count on sensitive penalties .	-5.0462
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place at the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Daging .	-2.9703
There was a collision between a truck and a passenger .	-4.0274
A rescue helicopter was on the road to the accident site .	-2.9584
Deutsche Bahn : Group tested " Comfort Check-in "	-3.5966
It is a moment almost everyone has experienced : nothing is left in the train and is a hassle .	-5.5701
Or it is deepened in its work and has a very basic idea .	-4.5788
And then : put .	-2.6494
If the Schaffner comes and an ungently or leaves a passenger in the midst of the workflow .	-5.8861
Ticket control .	-3.2176
But the days of disruptions are over .	-3.3484
The Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the smarter ticket control .	-4.2601
You simply confirm by phone that you take your seat and appreciate the ticket .	-3.9012
Currently a test operation runs on two tracks .	-2.0964
" Go to the offer , let us take it .	-4.9929
It is expected to be available on many other long-distance routes in Germany early next year , " said a train preacher .	-4.7941
" Comfort check-in " means the route card evaluation without a Schaffner .	-4.3483
In order to be able to use them , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.5198
And you have to book an online ticket - most of the passengers already do .	-4.4858
You also need to buy it using the App Bahn Navigator , which is the most convenient way to book tickets .	-4.8702
Last but not least , you need a seat reserved .	-2.4367
For the " comfort check-in " function in such a way that you increase in the train , calls your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.7975
The test customers then have a button on electronic devaluation .	-3.9245
The train attendants get a message on their mobile devices that the passenger is X in the train and has taken the seat Y .	-6.1519
If the train attendants arrive at Number Y when checking tickets , he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket already paid .	-8.8524
So you can sleep , continue working , keep quiet .	-4.6866
" Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railways , which in turn should be used by passengers .	-4.3021
" If you want to travel by our train staff without checking your ticket , check the DB Navigator himself .	-6.0704
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time during the train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernsehen .	-3.4417
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than now to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.9230
Anyone who is often busy is aware that , apart from delays and passing trains , the ticket controls are one of the main obstacles .	-6.7780
You often have your own documents , but in any case one of our fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to analyze online tickets .	-6.7316
Either you don 't have a credit card or an identity card , or you don 't need a document .	-6.3027
The result is endless discussions between train drivers and passenger , which leads to bad sentiment in the abbey or large room and delays in the control of your own tickets and ultimately takes time for the Schaffner to take care of other concerns .	-7.7825
Only a few test customers can still use the new service .	-2.0836
And this is only possible on the ICE-915 Dortmund-Winter-Sporting and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-7.5343
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet available .	-2.6897
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Who Streets ? "	-2.7096
On 9 August 2014 , British Ferrell was gravitated to its core .	-3.4194
Just a day after she had arrived in New York City , she sat on the bed of an Airbnb-apartment she rented and scrolled by Facebook on her phone .	-5.3088
It stumbled on a post of somebody from high school .	-3.1179
" The police just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " it was said there .	-3.1972
Confused because no one else had pumped the information on their feed , closed it to Facebook and opened Twitter .	-4.8476
A user with the hand @ TheePharoah was constantly retouched at their timeline .	-3.6823
The rapper in the area of St. Louis was killed in live the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-4.1052
He posted an image of browsers that was unstretched on the streets and would remain there for four hours .	-4.9827
" That 's great " , thought Ferrell with himself .	-4.5955
But the death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.4805
She dismissed her mobile phone to return to tweets about people in the Canfield-Drive .	-4.7394
There were photos of the police band and people who shook , and of a man who claimed to be browns father who bore a shield with the record : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-5.3716
They observed a live feed where a policeman stood before a group of demonstrators with a nice dog .	-3.3813
In another video , she said , another policeman sent his gun and screwed : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-4.0818
" That is not common " , says Ferrell .	-4.2878
" This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call " .	-4.1984
At this moment I felt a shock .	-4.0324
I was angry and weird . '	-2.1964
They booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-2.0970
After landing at 23 o 'clock , she took her 6-year daughter out of her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-3.6886
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Why Streets ? " , in which cinemas are released from the 11th .	-4.8454
It is a story of survival and of protests , love and loss , strength and resilience that consists of people living in the Community and filling the streets to demand answers .	-4.3077
When Ferrel went to Ferguson with her daughter , who had a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two spoke a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and black state « .	-5.4241
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " They remembered what they said .	-4.1724
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.6999
I could not take them " , said Ferrell later .	-2.7138
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-3.0103
It must know and see it and be brought up .	-3.5606
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the different layers of black experience and black constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves .	-4.3128
Although I am lucky to have an experience in which they personally do not experience blatant racism , it is no different from the next black child in women .	-4.6063
I feel I would be doing her a bad service to keep them out of it . '	-3.7002
The first station when it arrived in Ferguson was located on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp when activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-6.6151
There , Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made lunch .	-3.8877
They prepared pockets and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.1730
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrel shape began to assume .	-3.5995
" My activism has changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St Louis of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-5.3047
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.8306
Everything has happened . '	-2.9197
Weeks later , Ferrell met Sabaah Folayan during an evening demonstration , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.9010
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to ' document ' what happened .	-4.5949
One question came in Ferrell ’ s mind : “ Did you document or try to find a story that you can use ? ”	-4.6301
This skepticism has been fed by countless cases of people , often by whites , in a community that has benefited from its pain and resilience .	-8.8309
As Folayan said recently in an interview , " We heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not centres their votes and we wanted to do otherwise . "	-5.1980
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism about death street occupants .	-4.5713
His commitment made Ferrel closer to the project , together with six other locals , followed the team of " Who Streets ? " in the years to browser 's rescue .	-6.4482
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us .	-2.5766
" That was the main thing for me how these people are represented , because that is how I will be represented . "	-3.4954
The aim was not to focus on Ferrells 's experience - to show that the movement ' is not a Messios leader but a community that comes together ' , Folayan said - it proved to be the most open participant in the movie .	-5.3125
As a result , documents of " Who Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrells life as she falls in love and marry her wife .	-3.8576
" I felt like nude " , said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.3514
" But I understand that there must be a certain degree of vulnerability in this work and in the degradation of black people . "	-6.4424
Moreover , Ferrel ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-ivs-Mather movement .	-3.8463
Two of the three founders of the movement that , following the death of the Black Teenagers Trayvon Martin in 2012 , marked the movie " BlacklivesMatter " in social media identify themselves as gay .	-8.8046
" Black , gay women in management positions have supported the movement as a whole " , said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-4.1832
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of all . '	-2.2471
Folayan agreed to notice that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-3.1029
It insists , however , that " this is not an affidable type of action " , where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity .	-4.5881
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-2.8121
" It is no coincidence , even though she was at the front front front front front front , because in a life on these crosses , she is a black , gay woman at stake .	-6.8876
You can feel their energy through the screen " .	-1.9027
In the meantime , the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racist links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-3.7251
Ferrell is at probation for 2 <unk> years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.4225
It describes the region 's social and political atmosphere , which she calls her home : ' a chaos ' .	-4.8097
Yet she remained engaged in a singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-4.9663
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.7468
It is our duty to win .	-0.9176
We must love and support each other .	-0.8805
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . "	-3.5090
From " Dream " to " Things to size " : TV readers discuss bit-gallery .	-3.0805
The Bit Gallery moves people even though it is not yet built .	-3.7038
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern edge of the pedestrian zone has been splitting the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .	-4.1458
Kalt doesn 't make the issue any difference .	-4.1533
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksbutz Bitburg " .	-4.0961
While some say to the bitch gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " This would be true class " ( Nicole Schatten ) , comes from the other side : " Don 't have a human " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply " sizes ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-7.1401
While the supporters insist that a gallery attracts more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian precinct will end .	-6.8951
In addition , the gallery is planned on the plot where the farmers ’ market hall is located , where 13 direct marketing marketing products are available .	-6.6673
This will stop when the construction works begin .	-3.9633
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting outside .	-5.0812
Simone Rooms : " We have been purchasing our farm for many years almost weekly .	-3.4221
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women always gladly .	-4.0179
We also discovered the butchers .	-2.9073
We would like to see this offer maintained even during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-3.8279
There are also other cities .	-3.1048
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-2.3829
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rental goes up .	-4.9665
This is not likely to be very low with the new project . '	-4.4274
Eva Kilic : " Why to purchase palaces in Bitburg ?	-3.3490
Whether clothing , shoes , drone-making or supermarkets : I find this superfluous .	-4.2969
There is enough in our city already .	-3.3283
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.3176
However , as there is not even a proper weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least maintain the market hall .	-3.9813
After all , the products offered there are fresh , mainly offered directly by the producer and , above all , it is inexpensive .	-6.4654
As you see , shops in a shopping center are only accepted by larger companies , because the rental companies there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-6.4548
It is a shame that special shops have almost stopped and what remains of it will probably disappear . '	-7.3598
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping mall with a market hall doesn 't match me .	-2.5748
And the gallery does not adapt to Bitburg .	-2.4558
In particular , where should the farmers ' market hall go up during construction time ?	-4.5892
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-4.0842
Or does the Gespens Bit gallery already manage all business from Bitburg ? "	-5.2778
George Marquet : " That will simply not work .	-1.9911
And a shopping centre that is empty doesn 't need any one either .	-3.9001
I think it would have been better to promote a proper agricultural market instead of this gallery .	-3.3130
But thanks to the insufficiently many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg no longer have a place for a rural market hall .	-6.1685
Once the peasant market shrinks , a piece of culture will disappear . '	-5.0964
A fitting similarity : artist creates portraits of Chelsea Mannings DNA	-3.1763
In the middle of the area of Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost unimaginable - that depend on cable from the ceiling .	-5.6494
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heath Dewey-Hagborg from Wanen-Tuhorseback and hair cut sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.7842
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former secret service analyst forbade a 35 year sentence after making publicly classified diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website .	-5.4149
The new exhibition , opened on August 2 , is called A Beengenderce ( A Appropriate similarity ) .	-5.1288
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline incorporated its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a transcript and a groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had been in his office only three days .	-6.0219
Dewey-Hagborg has a sharp , if even some intellectual comment not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of this interpretation - but also about identity .	-6.5852
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has talked openly about the identification as a woman since her ability , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the Spinonagelaw , computer fraud , and theft .	-6.7446
Her image was badly repressed by the prison , so much so that there was only one photograph - a grazing , black and white Selfie , in which Manning obviously sits on a driver 's seat and wearing a plain string - with which she was associated .	-8.1017
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg joined the great success of its 2012-project Stranger Visions .	-2.9483
In it , the artist produced portraits of foreign artists from forensic artefacts such as cigarette studies and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look .	-5.7837
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.0869
" They had an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.9958
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked her to make a DNA portrait .	-7.1737
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unaffordable letters , which in the course of two years shared multiple letters .	-4.9432
They even produced a comic " Suppressed Images " , illustrated by Short Kanungo , which anticipated a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be converted and able to view the exhibition personally .	-5.5503
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama ’ s release would demand , after seven brutal years , in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome form of happy meetings .	-4.1623
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against government officials and transgenders troops to find new ways to overcome the rigid divisions that he should actually resolve .	-7.2921
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that ' things happen for a particular reason ' .	-2.9096
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called " i " in her family name , an end to " automatic fragmentation , which was the basis of gender , race , sexuality and culture " .	-5.6453
On the opposite wall is their mitochondriale DNA sequence - a thousand per cent of Cs and GPs and As , written in pencil .	-6.5515
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nukleotide after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.1913
" What people will hopefully take is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spourious Memories , is also to be seen .	-4.5171
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these 30 stories are . "	-3.4589
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-5.2199
It shows Manning how she plays with a free speech phone in the hands of the Disciplinars in the United States such as Kingong .	-7.0436
" If they scale your speech , they won , " it is .	-2.9527
" So never stop the mouth " .	-1.6457
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me " , said the artist , who made a gesture of Philadelphia .	-4.3332
" I still get a lot of time when I speak about it . "	-5.5388
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do so , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , from its own genomical simulators that mix themselves like the Horde of the Protestants .	-7.1501
It was also targeted as everything in the exhibition up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings Statur ) , in which their genetic Hagon groups were written with pencil .	-5.7863
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-3.1779
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that shaped itself with Chelsea , like the movement that also covered behind it . "	-4.0367
A professor of the University of Northwest and an employee of the University of Oxford for Tötung is looking . the of and are . are , , , and the , , and , and .	-9.6758
A nationwide hunt is underway for a professor at Northwest University and a staff of the University of Oxford , looking for as suspects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-4.9841
On Monday , for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) warrants were issued for murder due to their supposed participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duraneleau , as evidenced by the acts of the Official Court by Cook County .	-5.1107
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , after several stitches died .	-2.2784
A Community warning system published by the police authority of Chicago states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-3.0516
Officials received a call , joined the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.4714
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of events , and detective examining the run-off as murder , while the police actively seeking the two suspects , said officials .	-6.9882
Latehem has been an exceptional microbiology and immune professor at Northwest University since 2007 .	-3.3742
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice-President for university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been certified and excluded from the subject of the campus in Northwest University .	-8.0765
" This is now a criminal issue investigated by the competent authorities , and the Northwest University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.8418
Warren is Senior Year Assistant at Oxford University .	-2.3540
A spokesman of the University and of Somerville College said in a mail declaration that ' we are in contact with the police in the UK and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in any way possible ' .	-4.8140
Moreover , Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .	-4.7913
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Guglilmi , said that he strongly urge the suspects to stand up to the authorities .	-3.5583
" The police have an idea of their place of residence and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves " , said Guglielmi .	-3.4344
Guglilmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-1.9991
Guglilmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza-building , who had just received a puzzling advice that said that something was happening in apartment 1008 .	-5.4224
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.6177
Guglilmi said that it is unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.6955
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.5208
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglilmi .	-2.2966
The management team at Grand Plaza issued a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the time-axis and the background of the victim and explore a variety of motives , including a possible domestic event . "	-4.6704
" We will complete the WADA plan in the near future " - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Muttko	-3.0371
Russian Prime Minister Vital Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be applied for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUADA ) .	-9.2603
" At a certain stage of compliance with the criteria of the road map RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-7.1907
The WADA travel plan has been updated in this regard , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-4.8565
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for reintroducing RUSADA and published recently on the organization 's website .	-3.9420
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could cause concern for Russia .	-3.5100
" Everything was announced , everything is being implemented .	-3.6465
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and to the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.1577
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren to alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.9415
As regards the matter , Mutko said : ' We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system failed .	-4.1699
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.6471
But there were no public programs , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-3.8730
Mutkos ’ s words were in line with those of Vital Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-3.8980
When talking to the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day Smirnov gave problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , he added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and rules .	-5.0186
No one plans to accept this report unconditionally , ' added Mr Alernov .	-4.1382
In November 2015 , as part of the MODA ’ s doping scandals , RUSADA was excluded from the conduct of doping controls in Russia .	-5.8167
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKIP ) .	-2.3847
After a visit to Moscow ’ s headquarters in July , WADA-Director-General Olivier Nigli declared that RUADA is moving " in the right direction " to be reclaimed .	-10.3508
Aldi now no longer sells eggs	-3.0946
That divided the business groups .	-2.7660
It was a purely precautionary measure that there could be no further provision for health impairment , it was stated in the communication .	-7.3018
From now on , only eggs should be supplied to Aldi , who have been demonstrably tested against fibreglass containing anti-laminates .	-7.7782
Thus Aldi wanted to establish clarity and transparency with his customers .	-3.8663
The start ups , which will help your company , will not be able to become the next public .	-4.5224
Amy Schmitt wanted to measure the luck with your staff in your e-Commerce startup , but the surveys didn 't work .	-5.4419
Often , answers have been vague , little helpful , or , worse , fraudulent .	-3.3244
And even if you nationalize anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-3.9865
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Erbst , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-3.6350
She has called foreigners for help .	-3.8139
A new race of the human resources startups is on the guard to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.8743
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee involvement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , address specific groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaints hotlines , and in some cases allows whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite managers and turn directly to the board .	-5.6870
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-4.7395
She said she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel with Glint over the three years .	-4.4604
In addition to the snack surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heatmap of the company that shows at a glance what units most have complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can watch why .	-7.1745
Companies come to see that at the top of the workplace culture must remain so that you will not be the next user involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment punished by those who have spoken .	-6.6904
For starting-ups like Glint , this desire is for an overview a lucrative business opportunity .	-4.1931
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could be worth more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments Finance website .	-4.4298
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increased interest and activity beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber-Falles in Discredit .	-5.6104
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.4335
Uber recently signed up as a client .	-2.2303
Like Glint , Convercent allows companies to send customised " powder surveys " , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-4.4381
It also provides an anonymous SMS-Hotline with which employees can report bad behavior .	-2.7475
And when the chief executive is involved complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.7441
" The public opinion court has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quintan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-3.8218
When a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically , it can have costly consequences through consumer boycotts , worker turnover , and complaints , say Quinlan .	-7.0957
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way of achieving their business centre .	-5.3654
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company ’ s headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.1705
It was often a intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-3.2380
Now that the company is doing Convercent , problems that were previously hidden by leaders in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment , or dishonest practices .	-5.7001
" I can come closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-4.1364
" And we protect our shareholders against job disputes " .	-3.4758
Businesses began to take ethics , values , and staff engagement in 2002 more seriously after Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical violations by the Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-5.4658
But it took for the " social media to come to their right " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .	-4.7194
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.3884
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-3.3415
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both startups .	-3.1786
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-2.4195
Glitzers secured $ 10 million in November from Better Venture Partners , bringing all of his funding to $ 60 million .	-3.7365
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.4074
There is a growing research complex that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have until now .	-3.8061
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only efforts .	-2.1315
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.2949
" If people are happy to be in a company that heard their voices , and that the work you do is worth doing , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and United Nations Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-6.8288
Investors yield returns when their portfolios run well ; businesses run well when employees are committed and committed .	-4.1649
If third-party analytics tools promise to increase commitment and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.4398
Data about employee involvement in the workplace culture experts is important .	-3.2522
But the data are useless if a company 's managers do not take any action .	-3.7779
Indeed , when a company asks for your feedback , it may be a expectation that change is on the way .	-4.3492
And if change does not come fast enough , or at all , it can breed disappointments and discourage employees .	-3.8096
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who had seen too much of the gathering of data .	-5.2312
" For if you do not follow people will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-2.9347
Is this what you think ?	-3.6491
Who do you not care why should I ? '	-3.4667
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly staff surveys , was able to take action on the same day , if a problem is reported about Glint , so apposite .	-5.8782
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was through the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication shot to address the problems .	-4.1754
At Ruby Tuesday , the company gets new insights about its employees and hopes that in the long run , this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.3619
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.2857
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.6403
And if you lose customers , then you will lose companies .	-2.0820
The NCALA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-4.5714
It goes back to 23 o 'clock , when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-5.3196
Some have pulled out of their tricoconuts and show the back full sweat of the first day of the training camp .	-4.0928
For a good part of the team these busy minutes are a lunch break .	-3.5317
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 a.m.	-4.2691
" This is a real pomp mill for the guys over the next three days , " said Bruins-trainer Jim Mora just before the Monday was Tuesday .	-4.1745
The NIKA eliminates two-day exercises to ease the burden of players and actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.9786
Therefore , the first three courses of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 to match the players ’ already packed time plans .	-5.8291
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the opening of the camp almost a week after the last season and carried out practical training during the summer school for the first time during Moras ’ s six hours in Westwood exercises .	-6.2567
They are expected to hold 18 exercises during the course of August , 20 before the start of the formal preparations for their performance against Texas A & M in September .	-6.6178
Mora said that he supports the rule change of NCAA , even if they add another point to the more busy routes of players .	-6.3613
" We place this huge burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.5390
" And they just shot it through , they continue to laugh , they are great people .	-4.3458
I think as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great ' .	-3.7088
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp finishes , which , in view of the clear lines of its fields , will be no easy task in view of an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the high class that has already been supported by footballs that have closed a safety net behind a turf station .	-9.7883
Bruins players are expected to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mora admitted that there might be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-5.1657
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.1547
" This is a real problem , and it is not too good to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to show an exercise there .	-6.1280
If you have the video band of an exercise , it 's a pretty good business .	-3.2157
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-1.8040
We will do the best with what we have .	-0.9900
I am not therefore too concerned .	-2.2538
We have a plan . '	-0.8608
Facebook wants to intensify Tatand-Review in the fight against fake news .	-3.5829
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports of third-party fader auditors , and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of ’ s efforts is to combat .	-8.1280
In an opinion on its website , the company said that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible false reports and send them to fader auditors who might show results of the actual test from the original article .	-7.2565
Facebook was criticized as one of the main points of defense for so-called fake news , many of whom believe that it also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .	-4.0066
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooding with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hacked postings as they did before the September elections .	-5.0668
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that in the US , France , the Netherlands , and Germany a test of the new fact-review will be launched .	-3.7615
" In addition to the realization of which stories are challenged by fact-reviewed third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-4.8132
She added that Facebook would continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to his news campaign to reduce false news .	-4.5841
Create a comic novel : A Palace in the History of England	-2.7237
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a nightcap for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s .	-5.5965
But Scotland has seen 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel from Jamie Rhodes , a mophaarien Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents .	-6.3833
" I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years " he says weary .	-3.4480
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands . "	-2.2027
' A Castle in England ' dates from the Middle Ages to the era of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotland .	-4.9415
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's tea and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found unexpected emotional .	-3.4085
" I just responded to the thumbprint on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700-year-old who worked for the Jacobins " , he says .	-5.2059
" That is his thumb pressure !	-2.5517
And letters always fire after smoke , because at that time a fire was opened because of the light .	-4.7876
For someone who lives 300 years later , smell has an effect as if he were with it .	-3.7180
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.1024
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council in England and lived almost four months in a castle ( " To be honest : I have overvalued my welcome greeting a little " ) this seems too nice to be true .	-5.6777
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , passing through the archives , studying the many treasures and curiosities of the palace , such as the catchy hymn heads of the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in tombs .	-5.3796
He emigrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and talked to landscape investors , gardeners and sometimes artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-4.8092
Then , at night he " whiskey " and started writing .	-1.7226
The intimate history of Scotland is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access until 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Husey , died .	-4.4645
When Rhodes reached a decade later , employees began to care about the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , read it on the attic " .	-5.5979
There are diaries , letters from the time of English Empires , cards that represent who possessed : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to have fought two families .	-5.9826
Young , let everything go on ! '	-4.2296
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into the English history on a wider basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the new castle built to join the farmhouse 's climb of 1381 .	-6.9147
" There is a record of a glory which occurred in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knighty Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-4.5009
" The peasant uprising started in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .	-2.9669
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-2.0232
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle - like ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit pater , who locked the Darrell family for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.8067
Or ' The Smugler ' , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed from the 18th century , who staged his own burial by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-6.0874
The Darrela were the favorite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be pretty Gauner , repeatedly making debts , and spending money on things they could not afford .	-6.1698
Other generations of Darrell men extinguished their debt crises by getting rich old women married - I imagine them as a bunch of young people looking well , with a talent to recruit heirs . "	-6.9204
After the end of his visit to the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-3.8496
He has given himself a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comics novel about Elämäääämäki , the site of a sanatorium dating back to the early 20th century which has been re-claimed by nature since then .	-7.6615
But Scotland has a special place for him .	-1.8621
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-1.2087
It was like : ' Oh , now I must go back to digest life ' .	-4.0397
Campaign launched : cover over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhineldorf .	-3.1115
With the decoration of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( tour show on Thursday ) on Friday .	-5.0540
Until Thursday , mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.5129
At the end of August there should be a feast on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.2312
" Very nice for us .	-1.7197
Or ? " , the machers of the action have been asking on the posters at the Rhöndorfer chapel since yesterday .	-4.2331
" We don 't think this ( of course ! ) , " write it on their websites that were opened yesterday .	-5.2344
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.6556
And to make it clear that things are better than it seems .	-1.8575
Basically , we firmly believe that we , as our citizens of Belgium , are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-5.8532
The action involves more than " only " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.2750
" It is necessary to make one single promise , one that gives the city a unique unique unique unique unique unique unique feature " .	-5.5617
After all , they are in competition with other communities .	-3.0691

Turkey ’ s Military Reforms – Erdo<unk>an ’ s Fear of the Army	-2.6512
Every year in early August , in Ankara , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotion in the Official Corps .	-5.5354
This is the same week .	-2.3028
At first glance , a normal procedure .	-1.5767
But nothing is routine with Turkish forces one year after the coup attempt .	-1.2359
The sitting was no longer held in the building of the General-Council , as in the past , but in the Prime Minister 's official seat .	-7.9411
During the discussions , the President of the Council , the five Deputy Heads of Government , as well as the Ministers for Defence , Internal Affairs , Justice and External Relations , have now also participated .	-6.7503
The civilians in the YAS were overnumber .	-3.4264
The government pulls out the reins in the military .	-2.9276
The chief of the army , Hulusi Akar , remains in office , but the army ’ s commander , the air force , and the Navy were replaced .	-6.1851
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired the 326 generals and adobels .	-3.3608
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to obvious links to the movement of the Excl-Prediger Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as the masterminds of the coup .	-6.3713
486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt have been negotiated in Ankara since this week .	-3.1779
Even on the day after the coup , Erdogan had described the crash attempt as a " gift of God , " because he gave him the opportunity to " completely clean up " the .	-5.3852
But has Erdogan really managed the army ?	-1.8602
At the end of February , the newspaper " Schlüriyet " published an article entitled " Ununeasy in the military headquarters " .	-4.1907
There are general concerns about an increasing " Islamicisation " of the army , which , among other things , manifested itself in the lifting of the head attack on soldiers , wrote the newspaper .	-5.7840
So great cleaning up the army and the security forces continues .	-4.5489
In mid-July , Erdogan sent a decree to fire further 7395 officials , including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers .	-5.2253
Yet Erdogan seemed to be counting the military .	-2.6496
The generals were in the past performing the actual masters of the country .	-4.4989
Three times they did ornament on their role as guardians of the secular order of state .	-2.7362
After his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the military ’ s power back step by step , not least by calling for the European Union ’ s reform ambitions .	-4.5514
Former officers say that Erdogan is a targeted driver of Islamisation of the armed forces .	-4.5837
In the magazine " Voice Europe " , a specifically non-named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time .	-4.9540
If so , such a development could not make NATO cold .	-3.2908
At the heart of the alliance , there are doubts about the readiness of the Turkish army to act .	-5.1468
Learners and operational abilities are " impaired " , say Nato diplomats .	-3.7219
Washington rules governing the Green Card	-1.8221
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.0312
It aims to reduce legal immigrants at 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary employment permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-4.5396
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.7444
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-1.7121
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , and save billions of dollars on taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries use Green Cards . "	-3.3792
The law will prevent Chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.6576
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-5.1413

Time and again over the past few months there have been clashes about the future of the race track track track - it should now go very quickly .	-7.4848
Before the end of the year it is planned to be built on the marbles on which the tourist railway runs .	-5.6113
In order to secure the future of the race track in the long term , according to the Ministry of Transport , construction works should begin this year .	-5.5169
" With the decision to continue to order and renew the Ilmenau-Rentensteig route , the country commits itself to this important link , especially for tourism , " declared Minister of Transport , Klaus Schwehl , in Erfurt on Friday .	-9.9526
He put the costs of recovering the route to around EUR 2.5 million .	-4.1818
From that sum , the country is taking 75 % .	-3.8250
The treaty on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future will be definitively voted , declared marsh .	-5.3755
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Rail as an operator are already agreed on the technical details .	-9.2115
" This negotiated the road map , the cars used and the quality standards , " said true .	-4.3318
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years .	-3.3485
That is why the race platform shuttle should be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-4.3870
The race platform shuttle is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Racetrieg stations , especially for tourists .	-5.4838
Over the past few months , a pilot operation has been tested on whether the route is used by far enough people to order it regularly in the future .	-5.8500
The route is also heavily developed in parts .	-2.2025
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned .	-1.7139
Just when you thought that it could not be reversed in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is coming up .	-4.7364
Yes , in fact .	-1.3839
Sexual robots are a big thing at the moment .	-2.2365
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-1.7927
According to Noel Sharkey , emergent professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take its climb seriously .	-3.5899
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest coat and the type of fingernails .	-3.8587
" People are making a mockery of them , but businesses supply a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey at the publication of his new report .	-6.4643
Modern sex buffs have developed their assailable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions obtained by artificial intelligence .	-4.7249
The user can " adjust his robot according to his convictions " and thus select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest maintenance to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.9566
But it will be even more worrying because many robots have the " figures " that would make a stepford-woman look progressive .	-5.0725
Modern sex pumps have developed into robots with a silicone skin .	-2.9895
For example , the RealBotix robot allows users to customize their robots to the features they find appealing , such as bullying .	-3.9055
And then there is the Roxxxxy Gold Sexy Robot developed by True Companion with preconcepted personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , who convey the impression of Schüterheit and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-6.3407
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as good as possible to your personality , " owls the website of True Companion .	-5.6651
She like what you like , and she doesn 't like what you do , etc .	-3.3429
Over the course of the day , she also has their votes - quite like real people !	-5.2088
She can be tired of being obsessed with conversation or she can be " in mood " ! " and are . are , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.1513
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the submissive female properties , the demands of rape when you get a step on Frigid ( that is , contradictory ) Farrah , disturbing one of the most .	-6.4660
On his website other contrary to True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibration , but for men .	-7.9824
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " says it on the site .	-4.6619
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toys .	-2.4911
Their emergence and growing refinery point to something dark and deep in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as . are and in , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.1681
Of course , most men will not hold sex robots , and while the FRR continues to perceive their popularity , they remain on the brink of consumer culture .	-4.6268
But what leaks from the peripheral zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.1581
And many people are not strange or offensive until they are allowed to do so .	-2.8898
There is a certain amount of overlap that these highly developed sex robots are appearing at a time when women ’ s rights are threatened worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who has been clamouring for sexual attacks on women .	-4.9187
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of Magd ' ) is not graphic images , the permeable body and the hidden eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-9.1349
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-3.1915
The goal behind these sex robots is to make physical resemblance to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with pornorigid proportions ) .	-4.9331
Their builders want them to feel human , that they emulate the movement of a real body .	-2.7372
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-2.8765
They cannot separate themselves from their pets or just go away .	-3.6649
You don 't have any mediation or background history , anything that indicates independence or anything that might disrupt imagination .	-4.4471

Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-0.7862
Mitt Romney makes the concept of healthy sense .	-3.7690
It has become a sign of the Trump era that the political divisions that the US electorate has polarized have also split families in small format .	-4.5886
Around Christmas and Ernteth , there were newspapers in the US about how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s voting relatives .	-4.3123
We are all supposedly committed to allowing our filter bubbles to burst .	-2.4069
Less noticed is the power of Trump to bring families together .	-3.0586
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet living in Chicago , who has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-4.4182
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .	-1.9159
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows it , including the Republican kin with whom she fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and unmistakably on the same side .	-4.9381
This is certainly a good thing to do with the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this also brings with it considerable risks .	-5.2117
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s exhaustion has the power to push us all to the right .	-4.3496
When we talk of ' normalisation ' and Trump , we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his moderation will no longer be dissipated .	-4.3148
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump ’ s Republican right-wing wing “ normalizes , ” which suddenly seem to be an incongruous connotation when compared to its standards .	-5.8992
Today , I find myself engaged in an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney 's eastern version of the dead - the car dog , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement was issued ) - both of which seem to be a very mild crime compared with Trump .	-6.8632
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as a measurement improvement .	-3.7048
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the Karusell in Central Park , the largest of the New Yorker Park carousel , and the best three dollars they can spend in the city if you do not need a coffee .	-5.2376
The horses are enormous , the fiberglas designs in the central cylinder - all clowns are tricky and the animals rotten to look after their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the climate-friendly music provides this in a strange way .	-5.9828
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream . the of are , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.2461
Fifty years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage is not a Swiss Cottage - but a massive circle of traffic in northern London .	-6.5948
However , Central Parkinson 's is still a magical experience , as two years , one 11-year-old and two women can go to it in the 40 's and all have a great time .	-5.4490
If I could have considered the Carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but , fortunately , no one has asked them .	-5.4284
On the other hand , this week I was forced in a store house to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could cross my credit card .	-4.2258
In the coffee house on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15 % drinking money - this to buy something about the charging table .	-5.3288
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to put people in a situation where no need is made .	-4.6182
The poor woman in the House of Commerce exculsively complained while I was tired of sharing my credit card with five stars .	-4.9839
Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison in hospital	-4.2141
Pistorius is the second time in prison for a hospital visit .	-3.1271
Last year he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hand joints , which , according to the prison authorities , suffered in one case in his cell .	-5.6082
Pistorius was convicted of death for murder following an appeal by prosecutors against an initial death sentence .	-4.0174
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of Valentine 's 2013 , bringing them on them several times through a door of toilets in his house in Pretoria .	-4.4969
Pistorius claimed that he had his girlfriend for a night intruder who was hidden in the cabin .	-4.0225
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-month sentence of Pistorius , from which they say it is too lenient .	-4.0022
The National Law Authority said that it would appeal to the South African Supreme Court and the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.3085
Pistorius risks increasing his sentence to 15 years when prosecutors are successful .	-2.8777

When Bauer Arnold finds a strange egg	-1.7636
As the last of the Blumberger schools , the four-klössler from the feet and Ephefenhofen were released on holidays and in the more leading schools .	-6.4496
In future three of the discharge students go to the Gymnasium , four to the real school .	-4.0120
At the same time , the Chief of the school director Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public in the Biepheim Civic House in Epphofen .	-6.6867
As a symbol for school abduction , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regina Meder , chose a young eagle growing in the Hennerhof but then released into freedom .	-5.1908
On top of this , the munerer Shar introduced a musical entitled " The Adler in the Hennerhof " .	-6.3215
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and let it be brushed by his chickens .	-3.4040
Instead of a chicken cheek , a small eagle came out .	-3.1088
But the hope of making him a chicken came down , the eagle broadened his wings and disappeared on a high mountain .	-5.3107
After that , the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in Yvonne Frank .	-3.6995
The Hennes danced with the young gocks , the cylinders wearing to the bet .	-4.8153
The Adler stand for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-3.1415
The kitten is different from the other kitten ( puken ) but is one of them .	-5.8373
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.3197
Its purpose is to be free .	-1.5439
They wish every four-stroke that he feels approved in his new school .	-2.9375
Then there was thanks to the colleagues , former schoolleader Michael Müller , who repeatedly raised teaching problems , and the parents ' representatives .	-7.0641
The spawning season is over , explained Class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-3.4689
They leave their students very unhappy after two years ’ instruction , because it was a really good time .	-5.7075
Finally , she was able to rely on the four-klässler .	-4.4784
In conclusion , all students made a song of summer and holiday time .	-3.4743
Yet children were delighted .	-3.9243
The new school year already has eight first-time subscribers .	-4.5778

On the morning of August 1 , a group of illegally camping people was arrested in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-2.7083
On the same day , they were released , while an investigation is ongoing .	-2.6754
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarian people were later released .	-2.2155
The Greek authorities have stepped up control of free camps and have issued significant fines to anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-5.0836
The checks will continue throughout the season .	-2.1975
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-1.9939
Software Update for diesel vehicles : What the people concerned need to know now .	-2.8402
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.5878
Do diesel drivers need to take part in the action ?	-2.3845
The main questions and answers in the overview .	-1.7661
At the same summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of approximately 5.3 million cars .	-3.3787
They should improve the exhaust behaviour of euro 5 and partly euros 6 cars .	-2.8664
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-2.2667
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club in Europe assessment :	-3.9596
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.1535
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-0.8460
" The obligatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schummelsoftware , " says Anja Smetanin .	-4.7331
The German Federal Railway Administration ( KBA ) has ordered this retrofitting .	-5.0154
How and when will customers be informed of updates ?	-1.7072
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but they have not yet given a precise date .	-4.4942
Daimler has reported to write to each party .	-3.2635
If an inspection is required anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-3.0713
How long are the overall remits going ?	-3.2552
" Heavy to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.9083
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and on political pressure .	-3.4396
" For we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment so far " .	-6.0817
How long will the update last ?	-1.4822
The equipment itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.9735
Time might be more complicated to get an appointment .	-3.1165
What are the drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-3.0035
The ACE sham is waiting for it .	-2.9749
Presumably , foreign manufacturers would pull back , as Smetanin .	-4.2507
Will there be a massive fall in prices for Euro 4 cars ?	-3.6403
The ACE was afraid of that .	-2.0486
But it is precisely in regions where bans on travel are at risk .	-3.9904
There have been no loss of value in rural areas for older diesel .	-2.8252
The ACE accident continues to wait for sale .	-3.4563
LL Cool J received Kennedy Center Award .	-2.1461
Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.1007
President Trump ’ s first prize-giving ceremony promises to be political .	-2.8791
One of the prize providers does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.9678
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the top awards in the prestigious Kennedy Center .	-3.0748
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , singer Gloria Estefan ( 86 ) and the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the producer of TV Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the subjects to be converted .	-4.6255
The awards will be presented early December .	-1.8972
To be traditional , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and be part of the award with his wife Melania .	-3.9097
As a result , the progressive TV series , Lera , announced that it would not participate in the gala .	-6.7713
He said to the New York Times : ' This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even to withdraw the funds - and that burdens me ' .	-6.1898
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the talks with Trump to make her view clear .	-3.7553
The Kennedy centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-3.0656
The former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hank and Sting .	-3.0424

Roland Wacker , Haslah Stadtbauer , will retire next year .	-3.4138
The place is already booked - but suitable candidates are rar .	-3.6422
For 31 years , Wacker Stadtbaumeister has been in operation .	-5.3227
And he still enjoys working as he is talking about in the press .	-5.1093
He reports varied but also challenging tasks that await his successor .	-3.0751
At the same time , he is surprised that , so far , no application application meets the requirements profile .	-5.3332
The town is looking for an architect or engineer for the next time .	-4.4450
Thus , given the regular termination deadlines , there is still plenty of time to prepare for it .	-6.3243
As Haslach works as a sub-building right authority for the administrative community , the Applicant must issue a qualification .	-6.1540
For this function certainly wants to keep the city .	-2.9938
If they were not able to fill them out , citizens would have to go to open business .	-5.2971
But proximity to the city and to it itself is important , says Wacker , who reports about a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens .	-5.5616
In more than 30 years in office , several important projects have been collected , with pride behind the wacker .	-5.1831
" We make the city alive , " he is safe from the building office and his staff .	-4.0353
There are also various projects on the agenda in the future : the transformation of the former Hukla-Areals and the Niederhofenparkplatz have been initiated .	-7.3507
The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , even stadium anization is still topic .	-4.1304
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million , ' if we do ' , estimates Wacker .	-4.7622
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-1.9882
The work here is fun ' .	-1.1562
The museum can accommodate up to 400 people .	-5.7479
With its own building yard and gardening we can react to a lot of flexibility .	-5.2578
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of green plants is often praising by citizens and visitors .	-4.4791
The old town as an ensemble of heritage protection is important to have " an eye for what is clean " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing town builder stresses .	-6.3279
The town-building team bears a high responsibility .	-5.0645
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs through my table " .	-4.3826
For supervision and coordination , he can count on long-term employees : Markus Neumaier ( bau ) has been there for ten years now , Manfred Schöner ( deep construction ) for 15 years .	-5.2361
Also , his successors will remain long , Wacker : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place " .	-5.6534
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate but also for the further development of the city .	-3.3416
According to information from the town of Haslach , you should be able to present a study with a Bachelor 's degree or a Bachelor 's degree in specialised architecture and have good technical knowledge in the areas of construction and construction law .	-9.1630

Pushed on wires : South railways closed .	-3.7668
According to the police , the perpetrators of the so far were topping the blue bicycle from the railway track in the area of Leoben Street ( B116 ) .	-7.4356
They were so badly damaged that the goods had to be stopped nearby .	-4.8072
The investigators run from two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night .	-5.0604
Close to the scene were seen by witnesses a rose-colored scooter and a bike driver .	-5.9171
" This goes far beyond a commercial " , said ÖBB-Speaker Christoph Posch to the APA .	-4.2713
The perpetrator or the perpetrator would have placed themselves at great risk and also threatened the movement of trains .	-4.9832
In addition to damage to the train and the facility , as well as the delays of minutes and the cost of rail transport , passenger trains could also be brought to the perpetrators .	-7.3457
The speaker said that the total amount should be determined by a ' substantial ' sum .	-4.5837
The damage had been fixed again on Friday afternoon , and rail traffic on the southern railway line could be caused without disability .	-6.2692
Nearly ten people were left on Friday morning , two of them went to the distance .	-5.2225
Goods were not withdrawn , but they were delayed .	-3.2747
According to ÖBB-Specher Christoph Posch , around 200 metres of head lines had to be exchanged .	-5.0925
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.7968
Rotes meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help to relieve IBD ( inflammatory intestinal disease ) .	-3.4811
Rotes meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestion system .	-1.6158
But a new study claims precisely the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products may help relieve symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases .	-3.9531
The malevolent state , which in the US concerns about 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , is causing heartening and bleeding , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-5.9945
While the victims usually get rid of meat and dairy products to ease their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptotophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that foster a tolerant intestinal .	-5.2066
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that the intestinal influenza immune cells in order to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in the food do not penetrate into the body .	-5.3492
Cells capable of dissolving inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-3.6640
If the equilibrium moves too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory intestinal disease may result .	-4.0685
Experiments found that a type of tolerance supported immunity cell is found in mice , which is a specific bacterium in its branches .	-6.0319
And the bacterium requires Tryptotophan - one of the building blocks of proteins to eliminate the appearance of cells .	-3.9371
Professor Colonna said : " We have created a connection between a bacterial nart - Lafcobacillus recuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbioms , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-5.6456
The more Tryptotophan had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-2.5253
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Tryptotophan rich nutrition fosters less inflammatory intestinal milieus if the same system also affects people .	-4.7596
The post-doctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-aragan studied a kind of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of students had such cells , but another group of the same stem which was separated did not have it .	-16.7640
She believed that the difference had to do with the intestinal microorganisms of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi living normally in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.1832
The mice demons were followed by DNA and six bacterial narts found in the mice with the immune cells , but without missing them in mice .	-7.3577
In a sterile environment , an intestinal microbiom was missing and did not develop this kind of immune cells , and the L. reuteri and the immune cells were created .	-7.1016
In order to understand how the bacteria turned out to the immune system , researchers L. reuteri could grow in a fluid and then supplied small quantities of liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells that were isolated by mice .	-5.9680
The immune cells developed into the cells that support tolerance .	-2.8230
When the active component of the fluid was purified , it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptotophan-metbolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-5.0090
When researchers doubled the amount of cryptotophan in the feed of the mice , the number of cells rose by about 50 % , but when the droptophates were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.8421
Dr. Cervantes-Baragan said that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tract .	-4.8801
It is not known whether Tryptotophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop the cells among people as in mice , but defects in Genen related to Tryptotophan were found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-6.3831
She said : ' The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-4.3850
Potentially , high droplet values in the presence of L. reduteri can lead to an expansion of this population . "	-4.4932
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United and Nemanja Matic have committed a " genius " .	-2.4821
At Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes , after the middle field player had his debut against Sambodia .	-4.0494
The $ 40 million signature from Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season match before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impresses in the holding role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira vanished .	-7.8877
However , Matic had been excluded from the launch of the Blues Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier Leadegue season .	-6.0360
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football " , said Mourinho .	-2.2454
" We will help him to be ready earlier than later . "	-3.9862
Besides Matic , Victor Lindenhof and Romelu Lukaku launched the Aviva stadium as Mourinho ’ s start XI for the start of the season .	-5.7240
The Independent this week revealed that Mourinho had three other new obligations , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its top priorities .	-5.0222
" To get three of four , for which I thank the association " he added .	-4.2703
" I will be happier if they receive four of four for me , but they have made a great effort . "	-4.6078
Boeing ' malt ' Dreamliner in the sky	-3.2430
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted a Dreamliner 's silhouette in the sky .	-3.0494
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US State of Washington , but the drawings started in Marquette in US State Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which are several thousand kilometers .	-4.9030
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.6941
The form of a Dreamliner was on the radar monitor .	-4.1936
It was an endurance test for new engines .	-1.4269
Boeing had previously made such advertising .	-1.4588

New Ties for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem .	-2.3474
How the wind turns : when Sigmar Gabriel was still head of the SPD , Socialist prime ministers were always concerned about Berlin before elections .	-4.1254
If the party ’ s central troublemakers don ’ t be fooled by the federal government , the election campaign ’ s most important wish was that .	-9.2928
Since Martin Schulz leads the party , that has changed fundamentally .	-3.2857
Since then , staff from the Willy-Brandt House , with growing horror , have been monitoring the events in the National Cities .	-5.3027

The Green Party leader Michael Kelner has asked Elke Twster ’ s short Dutch Green MEP Elke Twster to return to his mandate .	-7.3077
The passage to the CDU means a clear falsification of the will to vote .	-3.8247
Elke Twster must immediately give back its mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance ( RND ) .	-6.7012
" All this must not be true " , a SPD election campaign sighs out , when the new hiobfish reach the party ’ s central station on Friday morning .	-7.8963
Stephan Weil , Dutch SPD Prime Minister , is there after the passage of the Green MEP Elke Tweste to the CDU without his own majority of government .	-5.6050
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in the SPD national associations .	-3.9989

And because he subsequently made quite a mistake of what one can do wrong during crisis .	-5.3207
Since then , Scholz has fought for his political survival .	-1.5471

Because of the VW-emissary and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Lower Saxony prime minister has long been in the criticism .	-5.1658

The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to develop his power in Berlin also remained unknown in the context of Martin Schulz .	-4.0651
They allowed him to be granted because they promised that the party would be stabilized . the were , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.8434
Now the exact opposite may come about .	-2.8267
Because , in fact , the bipartisan split of the Lower Saxony Greens is not at fault .	-6.3690
Nor is Schulz .	-2.1966
For the time being , therefore , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed . are and are . are , , , , , ,	-5.0438
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and here in particular in the breakaway parliamentarians in the Twister .	-6.2960
" It is intolerable and anti-democratic , as Mrs Tweste puts her own career interests over the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD parliamentary group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-5.4677
Mrs Twster has not been elected as a direct candidate for her , but has been elected to Parliament via the National Register of the Lower Saxony Members .	-6.8298
The logical consequence would be that they have returned their mandate .	-2.5649
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD parliamentary assembly , is lamenting a " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-4.0335

Those who want to sane his house in the years can soon get support from the country .	-4.3170
On Wednesday , the mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEC urban development will be informed .	-6.0535
At the beginning of the information event Schindler once again gave a glimpse of what has happened .	-4.3023
Since 1991 there have been reconsideration areas .	-3.4165
Back then , in the area of regeneration , from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg still took over two-thirds of the grant amount .	-5.6945
After all , in the area of regeneration from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.8333
For Schindler the previous sanctions are a " success project " - it is important to promote internal development as well , and not just to open up new premises .	-5.7998
On 4 April , the Bureau of the Government of Karlsruhe received information that there will be a III restoration area .	-5.8111
The total amount of the subsidy was EUR 8333 333 , of which EUR 500 000 came from the land , the rest of the community felt .	-5.5785
What is the nature of a zone of regeneration ?	-4.1906
You will continue to check if the " really old " houses are .	-3.5999
But it also has a role to play in restoring interest in the planned area .	-4.3858
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be re-established .	-3.2545
On Wednesday , Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel were represented by STEC .	-4.3607
Keller presented the contents of the Bund Country Programme " Social City " , in which the sanctions would be implemented .	-3.6057
The core of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-4.5021
The measures would be carried out objective purchased , that is , per object .	-4.1104
The area of rehabilitation would then be laid down as a statute .	-4.2226
Since 1 January 2017 , the grants have run until 30 April 2026 .	-3.7263
Until September this year , however , we would first carry out the inventory in which the participants in the area of regeneration receive a questionnaire to fill out .	-8.0463
In November or December the decision on Satzugsshall be taken as possible , so that the sanctions can begin next year . are and are . are , , , , , , ,	-7.5517
Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each Commune must carry out the aforementioned preliminary studies .	-4.0967
It is important to evaluate urban grievances and to decide when is santed and to what extent .	-4.5238
A statement of restoration will be entered in the property book for the respective property .	-6.2349
Pietzmann will come back to feel again and make an impression of the situation , she promised .	-4.9434
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the .	-3.8998
Therefore , there will be questionnaire that will be sent to citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-3.7479
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and ground piece logon " , which deals , among other things , with the building condition and the restoration insights .	-6.5350
In the gray questionnaire , the " fiscal and housing arc " , information on the size , division and residents of a living room can be provided .	-4.8439
The blue " operating arc " can only be fill if business premises operate .	-4.5129
However , Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously an application for funding .	-3.3555
In addition , new construction measures are not eligible .	-2.2596
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funding according to the " greyhound principle " works - who comes first , mahlt first .	-5.4635
You can 't reserve any funding for later on .	-4.4452
In conclusion , photos of the project " Stadtlen II " have been shown to make the present " enjoyable " .	-6.9252
British inventors themselves use a microchip to get into home and car with a hand movement .	-4.0510
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.4901
Steven Northam , 33 , had impacted the tiny chip between Damen and Zenger and now offers the service to businesses and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by their company BioTeq .	-5.8658
He has collaborated with Dr. Geoff Watson , a Consultant at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is conducted according to medical standards .	-4.5431
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-3.1236
The company of Mr. Northam also wishes to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional cost of <unk> 300 per castle .	-4.6115

The White House ’ s advertising costs the taxpayer thousands	-2.1976
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event highlighted by American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers , according to military evidence left to the TIME magazine , up to $ 24,000 .	-4.6233
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is aboard , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-4.2106
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and White House ’ s senior officials have taken a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-3.6980
The helicopter , built in Connecticut , was exhibited alongside a yacht from Maine , a fire brigade car from Wisconsin and a fork from Mississippi .	-4.4164
The White House ’ s military office demanded the presence of helicopter in a fragmentary order , or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , following the record of Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-6.9465
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility " , wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his predecessor , the Vice-naval officer for aviation .	-4.4336
The news showed that the helicopter met at 7 o 'clock on the South Lawn on July 17 , and until the grass was cleared on this evening between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .	-6.2782
The note adds that if the flight was delayed from the White House , a second team would be required for the return flight due to restrictions on the service hours .	-4.8226
During the event , the original crew of the flight was situated at the helicopter , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-6.7669
The TIME records made available do not clearly indicate whether a second type of carrier was required at the end of .	-5.7878
The Hatch Act prohibits the use of federal property for political purposes .	-2.8746
rows indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-3.6565
" One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.3717
" When you were locked , " The Deputy commander replied .	-2.9522
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.2972
But official events also have political overtones .	-0.9279
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he advocated efforts to curb government regulations .	-5.6533
Use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes .	-3.6837
Presidents are obliged to use them for their journey .	-2.4821
But demanding their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-4.3102
Trump conducted an investigation in February when the president aircraft performed a taxi in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-4.5419
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers with American materials , " said the White House 's deputy press secretary , Lindsay Walters .	-3.5295
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to replace US White House President with precise age ranges .	-4.9407
When Trump was in early July at the G20 summit in Germany , HMX-1 led to 58 apprentices in the White House .	-3.4508
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the cabin crews for the month , said a civil servant .	-4.7099
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for non-presidential support missions .	-3.0437
The White House said that taxpayers did not accept the burden on any of the other acquisitions presented at the event .	-4.6390
One speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in placing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.7781
HMX-1 does not have presidential budget records , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-3.2019
However , according to unit prices of the US Defense Department for the 2017 financial year , the DoD unit for the VH-3D is USD 24380 per hour .	-6.3569
The aircraft was divided into three categories : Marine Corps Air Facility ( Marine Corps Air Facility ) , the Air Facility ( CPR ) , and in . the of were , , and . , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.6522
The White House argues that the actual costs of helicopter operations are well below that rate .	-2.4628
" The cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for compensation ratios is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-4.5542
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "	-3.0782
According to an RAND study from 2015 , refunds for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and conclusion of the contract .	-3.9396
At this time , the former White House Press spokesperson , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter ’ s deployment for the event .	-4.0575
" The idea is to present things this week that are produced in America , " said Spicer .	-2.6333
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , are dependent on it .	-3.5422
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.6151
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-1.9976
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he saw his round of the South Lawn for the event , but he turned into the driving seat of a fire car .	-5.9345
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky ’ s representative and quipped with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-4.4902
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said " I have three of them . "	-2.0754

" In the meantime , not only children who are cared for 45 hours of the week eat at Kita , " says Pomeranz .	-6.5448
" The offer also applies in the 35-hour service if children stay until 14 p.m. " .	-4.1146
46 Part-time staff will have a kitchen service from the 1st September : heat up the dishes supplied , supplement them with salad , raw material and fruit , prepare the meal individually , give the food , prepare and clean the kitchen .	-9.2840
" The workers are fixed to a kita , " says Pomeranian .	-3.6879
The size - there are two-group and seven group facilities - determines the total amount of time .	-5.1500

A union would like to know about the long-term commitment to produce at the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie ’ in Glasgow .	-4.8012
GMB Scotland said that the company had concealed itself over the future of investments at the Schampcross site .	-4.3875
More than 500 employees work at the plant , which in addition to other hobbies and Rich Tea Kekse products .	-4.6772

He added that employees and trade union representatives would be known as the first if their activities changed .	-3.9230
In a letter to the company ’ s branches , GMB has demanded that GMB be McVitie 's " concern is expressed that funding for the modernisation of production lines is not being promoted " .	-7.1215
GMB-Senior-Organator Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity on the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tolcross is deeply felt by our members .	-4.9308
Families have worked here , and work is concentrated heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social deprivation .	-5.0514
That is why , with jobs , wages , and prosperity in mind , and in the face of Brexit , rising cost of living and chronic production decline , Glasgow 's eastern end desperately needs a flourishing production presence in McVitie .	-5.8043
A speaker from Pladis said : " The Filialleiter at Tolcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , as we value the constant involvement of staff and trade union representatives .	-5.7659
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff and GM representatives at Tolcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-3.4885
We discussed with the employees that , like all the companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , we are constantly examining our business - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - in order to remain competitive .	-9.3317
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than GBP 5 million in our Tolrocross facility , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-5.1861

Has the PSG Barcelona warned against Neymar three years ago ?	-2.7304
The site of La League may be of interest to Marco Verratti bereuen	-3.6357
Paris Saint-Germain will not be disobeyed in the prosecution of Neymar after giving an offer of <unk> 189 million to dissolve its release clause , but did they warned Barcelona three years ago of the World Recycle ?	-7.7672

" I 'm not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said al-Khelaifi .	-3.3489
" We respect all clubs .	-0.8658
But if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . "	-3.3798
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Association expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-3.4303

According to the accident victims , it can be good that the Renault driver had not even noticed the accident .	-3.0905
The police are now asking for witnesses of the crash , as well as the driver of the polluter pays vehicle , to be contacted at Tel . 05761 / 92060 with the commission in Stollzenau .	-6.1998
Interview : ' Domfloat reports release Pope Georg Ratzinger '	-4.6455
The Regensburg Cathedral report on the abuses caused by Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger .	-4.2277
This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-3.7641
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Cathedral centres continues to hold discussions .	-4.3203
Christian Weisnder , spokesman for the reform movement " We are Church " , said after publication to the German Press Agency , he expects a apology from the former Regensburg bishop and today ’ s Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , and from the Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the erested Pope Benedict XVI .	-6.7862
It would serve very much to the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and the interest rate were to express their deepest regret at their own omissions , or at that time their misperceptions of events .	-7.3908
On the other hand , the Vatican Law " Osatore Romano " criticised the fact that ' double standards ' would be used in reporting violence in the domains .	-7.1538
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is ' shameful and shameful acts ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; however , it is striking to be the ' degree of media manipulation ' , the author of Luke Scarablasia , Historicist and member of the national bioethics committee .	-8.9071
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion for keeping that as normal , " says Scarabaia .	-5.7561
In the interview with the Bayerischer Rundfunk , Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : " You can ride on the church without having to do this and that is a hateful Fressen " .	-8.8396
She also pointed out that in her youth ' shots a very normal pedagogical instrument ' was ' to be done with frechen children , as I was one ' .	-6.1556
They thought it unfair to apply today to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-3.3937
In connection with the reports on malignancy cases , Papst-brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-5.6106
Quite unjustly , says author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote " My brother of the Pope " with interest groups ( translated into 12 languages ) . the of is .	-9.9276
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he appreciates the results of the accounts .	-4.1418
What exactly is stated in the 44-page report submitted by the informator Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by the Bisum Regensburg ?	-6.8011
All in all , 547 Regensburg ’ s Domenspas were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks .	-7.0540
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " So it can be said that in many cases , Domkapelmeister R. used forms of physical and mental violence .	-5.8711
Particularly in the event of high emotionality , punishment for the students could be more intense .	-4.4267
Nevertheless , contrary to many other accusers , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and , in many cases , even associate positive memories with him , despite violence . "	-8.3660
In the interview , Hessemann explains why the final report on the MississKandal scandal in the Regensburg Cathedral Babies Georg Ratzinger , in his opinion , overloads it .	-7.6300
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the " incidents of violence in the theft of the property in the Regensburg region " gives a contradictory picture of Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-6.7173
On the one hand , many students highlight their " humanity " .	-3.3967
On the other hand , he also seems to be a Choriker and perfect , which became the most powerful when a Domspacz didn 't bring top performance in the musical field .	-9.6399
How do you evaluate this final report as your biographer ?	-2.5961
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble to read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you need to ask yourself more why the name Georg Ratzinger is there .	-6.5219
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and is clearly free from any suspicion of complicity or belief in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-5.0230
The trials at the pre-school also took place outside its sphere of activity .	-4.3262
He can be accused of being too late or of not taking first sentences seriously enough .	-3.7154
The Cathedral Spatingyntum , on which he worked , was found by practically all the respondents as - " Ersolving " , " skies " and " better world " .	-7.3929
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also makes an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm " , " popular " , " competent " and " intelligible " , as a very fine teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always surrounded by children 's grapes " .	-7.4659
Only a minority complained about their sacrosanct and high emotionality , which has even given rise to poverty .	-6.4267
He was deeply sorry and apologized for years ago , and so did he accept that he was not only playing with stools and the key-ring on the ground , but also sending ear-cowardly boys to the hair or ears .	-11.7860
However , it must be said that in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , such education methods were widely used , for parents and teachers .	-5.5312
Are you still aware of such breeding methods ?	-3.5165
Of course , I think of all of us born before 1968 .	-2.9535
I have also seen this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.2979
However , compared with what this report is about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at pre-school , these are minor .	-5.4107
The question is whether it ’ s not more about his popularity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just rocked on him .	-7.7566
After all , many who have never understood him are still working hard on the Bavarian Pope .	-4.5400
The truth is , however , that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-2.6822
In the media , a great deal has been reported in connection with the report on the issue of abuse in the Regensburg Domzés .	-7.2507
Will Georg Ratzinger , in the final report , be charged with any involvement or participation in sexual abuse ?	-4.6407
Michael Hesemann : absolutely no .	-2.3585
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted the Domkapel-Master .	-4.7625
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.7315
" I never dreamed of speaking with my father or my mother about it , " said a person acting on behalf of the other , " It was all very embarrassing for me " .	-6.8584
The real problem of identifying sexual abuse is that most victims of shame are silent .	-4.3267
If they did not even become familiar with parents and siblings , then certainly not a choral leader who would have been , in a sense , a colleague of the perpetrator .	-6.2475
How do the Domsplitt-Kützer Ratzinger have a role to play with regard to abuse ?	-7.0561
Michael Hesemann : A student asked him so : " For sexual abuse ... I do not see any case in which Georg Ratzinger had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-7.5092
I think it is also absurd to think that it is absolutely absurd to ... those who have opened themselves in a more urgent or clearer way , or rather than their parents , boarding heads , teachers of trust etc .	-9.9888
That one speaks with him about sex ... - unthinkable . "	-2.9007
The report therefore came to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that the students concerned in advance and / or their surroundings were familiar with it could not be confirmed in the course of the investigation ' .	-7.1721
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of everyone .	-4.2307
Nor can he be accused of not obstructing or inciting him .	-3.3507
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these crimes , as happened unfortunately in some cases .	-3.5967
In the media a lot of " violence processes " was read in the Regensburger Domzitangen .	-6.0798
Georg Ratzinger , the former supporter of the Domkapelle , is accused of being accused in the " Weglook " report .	-7.0211
Will he have to live with this accusation ?	-2.3123
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that in reporting everything has been mixed and intermeshed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence processes and somewhere , in the middle of Georg Ratzinger .	-6.5029
But that is just another abuse of the report .	-3.3833
They are divided into two things : between preschool and the Gymnasium of dress , between sexual abuse and violence and , let us say , other .	-6.8181
In addition , the report deals with incidents dating back to 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the head of the Cathedral for four years .	-5.4524
All the horrible canopy pedagogy , the cases in which the captains of sadistic teachers were constantly harnessed and abused , all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions had to prevail .	-8.8776
But with those had nothing to do with the Domkapelmeister Georg Ratzinger , because he got the boys first to face when they were already on the Domspaghemnasium .	-6.3126
On that , as most of the witnesses emphasize , the subject of " pre-school " tabu .	-4.7635
One was only happy to be her and genos escaped the much better treatment and for many even ' paradise ' states .	-4.9575
What was different at the Domzitzgymnasium ?	-4.9246
Michael Hesemann : there was discipline , but there was no such thing as sadistic violence .	-4.5191
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that " many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in many cases , may even link positive memories with him " .	-6.3961
At most , however , there is still a suggestion that they should have looked out .	-5.2670
However , despite all the efforts , the report was able to define only two periods of time in which it was reported by the pre-school state .	-5.1519
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and had nothing to hear from the predecessors at a school where he did not know and was responsible , ( thus the witness ) , and then again at 1993 .	-6.4383
Will Georg Ratzinger get his ears before the stands ?	-4.6321
Michael Hesesmann : No , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Cathedral Cathedral department , which the report even reproduces .	-5.3393
He points this out that the practice of caning is continuing in the pre-school .	-6.5905
Even in view of the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.4274
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when canoes were long banned in Bavaria as well .	-4.9915
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everybody knows .	-7.0683
It was also difficult for him to assess where the persons concerned might have been exaggerated or dramatized , and where the permitted border really had been exceeded .	-8.3790
We cannot say that it would always have looked away .	-4.0913
That is simply not true .	-0.9194
It was only in 1980 that the caning penalty in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well .	-3.6703
Following Gloria of Thurn and taxis , it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical yardsticks to that time .	-5.5725
How do you see this ?	-1.5384
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " Falling Strick of Anachronism " , that is , the danger of judging the past according to today 's moral .	-6.0706
The princess is right .	-3.8293
Of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was monstrous at all times and not to what was happening in the pre-school in conflict and violence in innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond the ordinary at that time .	-7.0529
That is all terrible and I am glad it is finally up .	-4.0740
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-6.8601
His means of discipline and punishment , in other words words to drag back and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-6.1406
When physical punishment was then banned , he kept strictly from it .	-4.6614
What image of his retirement age has Georg Ratzinger given in the talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.7449
Is the caning penalty still in the language ?	-4.2858
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , since the domestics played only one side role .	-5.3029
Nevertheless , I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-3.3091
But it must also be said : without this perfect discipline , without the demand for unconditional discipline , it would have been difficult for him to form an institution of excellence from the national Regensburg domes , which had been known until then , the true cultural ambassador of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-9.0059
With Keksen and BonBonbons alone , you do not make big singers and every success in any area , no matter what discipline , passion , and self-indulgence .	-8.4420
As what kind of person do you have experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks with her book ?	-4.3004
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced time and again as wonderful , humorous , grubby , deep glass and heart-good people , from which one can not imagine that he could do just one fly .	-9.3050
I regularly get to know how many former domesticates still today , 23 years after his Emeritation , keep him regularly in contact , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-6.0816
So those who have not yet given him that he was tough to them are clearly in the minority .	-4.7114
Today , most of the domestics are grateful to him for enriching his life and bringing the world of music to them .	-3.9829
And that he was always a good teacher , a strict father , certainly that may be , but he was also a loving respect person to whom they are still chasing today and who devour them in fact .	-7.8575
And please , let me make it quite clear once again that all the information you submit to him is education methods that were on the agenda at the time .	-7.8279
We can be glad that we have long been overcome this time .	-3.0586
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat .	-2.7938
It is all too obvious that the bad intention behind it is .	-3.3257
Because the report that has just been published relieves it .	-3.2893
Now , the state of the city , a 93-year-old man who has acquired great services and who is not just Bavaria , and perhaps no one in Germany would know the city of Regensburg ’ s Cathedral , would finally be allowed to stay in peace .	-11.8791
