Gutach : More Safety for pedestrians	-1.6658
They are not 100 meters from each other : On Tuesday the new B 33 street in Gutach was taken into operation at the village parking area - in view of the older Town Hall lights .	-9.3194
Two installations so close to each other : intend or coup d 'état ?	-3.5527
This question was clearly answered by Gutachs Mayor yesterday .	-2.8577
" The ratehampel was installed at that time because it secures school , " explained the corner yesterday .	-4.6368
The Kluker Ampeel ensures both cycling and bus users and mountain residents .	-5.7111
The facility which was officially opened in operation yesterday is important for the cruise area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-4.9659
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , the bus station , a doctor and a bank and the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-4.3997
" With the high volume of traffic and pedestrians , another traffic light had to be secured , " so Eckert .	-4.8297
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the Board of in Offenburg .	-2.9870
" According to current measurements , about 12 000 vehicles cross the village of Gutach on the B 33 daily , some 10 percent of heavy traffic , " Arnold stresses .	-5.0110
Therefore , the construction of another light is more than necessary : " Safety just goes here " , says Arnold .	-4.4917
A total of four traffic visits were carried out , but a traffic-circle traffic was thought up again due to the Enge in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße cross area .	-7.4577
According to Arnold , when choosing the traffic lights , everything has been tested before : " With an extra for us with particularly long woodblock carriers we have prepared whether these vehicles can be taken from the cognac road to the B 33 without being able to clear the traffic light " .	-10.5173
The cost of around EUR 15 000 is the " state-of-the-art " currently available on the market , explained by Arnold .	-5.5362
The machine is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so hard that the lights are well visible from drivers , for example , even in the deep sun .	-6.2804
And thrift is it : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-4.1004
Three lighting systems are available per driven basis .	-3.6598
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .	-3.4263
By pressing the traffic light button , the top radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-2.7640
If the road is free , the direct green for the pedestrians , if not , takes about 15 seconds .	-4.2668
Another radar sensor will check if the green phase can be closed for the pedestrians .	-3.4857
" If a group or handicapped people go through the road , the green phase is extended , so everyone is sure to get out of the train " , explains Arnold .	-6.2262
Of course , drivers need to think as partners and watch the train .	-5.1614
This was not the case yesterday : barely showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , robbed a class vehicle - with bright red .	-4.8504
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years .	-2.4991
The disasters of his Catholic village kindness - the speechlessness , the slope to raw violence and the stupidity of sexuality , the Enge and Freudess - have often been described by Carinthia 's poet .	-7.4040
The book holder is known primarily as Prosaautor , theatre texts are in his work rar .	-4.7385
Collage from Proclaments Gerhard Fresser presents for his performance " Wetterspätzlich " , which is now visible in Garage X at St. Peter 's Square , so a collage from Prosatexten together .	-7.8926
The Theatermacher , for example , combines elements from the autobiography Roman " Der Leibegelen " ( 1987 ) with celebrities from " Leichtsam , his family besiegend " ( 2003 ) .	-5.6486
On the stage - important Revision : a crumbled sofa , where the sound is copied and masked - the eighth ensemble has been created through the text material .	-8.6890
In doing so , director Freesser seems to have little confidence in the text .	-4.2699
The 70-minute performance outperforms the presentation with a wealth of regime influences , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms of play .	-5.5787
In particular , the actors are affected in the sometimes somewhat questionable transposition .	-6.7150
They are strapped hard with their head screwed to the wall with their buttocks .	-5.5759
Embedded in cellophane or facial , they sat on dangerously high slicks through the production , either monologized them loudly or lie completely immersed on the stage floor .	-9.8502
However , the text hardly conveys itself in this way .	-3.2344
The best moments have in the evening when singing - the band reaches from Deep Purple to folk song good .	-4.3219
Only by the end the overturned performance comes a little to the peace , and Winliers lurk somewhat absurd humor .	-9.4555
A black box in your car ?	-1.5085
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining high-tech system , and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that finds every place in the dashboard rescue .	-6.3620
The devices that capture every kilometer in motion and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial effort by Washington and the states ’ planning offices to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads .	-5.9502
The typically boring area of road planning has suddenly ignited an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-4.1610
Libertarian have joined environmental groups and argue that the government can use small boxes to record the fuelled kilometres – and perhaps even where they have been – and then use the information for calculating taxes modest .	-10.4351
The Tea Party is appalled .	-0.8841
The American Association of Citizens ' Rights ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and makes a number of privacy concerns .	-3.5116
But , while Congress cannot agree on actions , several states are no longer waiting .	-7.3003
They are currently examining how they can change to a system in the next ten years , where drivers pay for a safe Meile .	-6.1401
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachograph some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance .	-2.7504
That really is a must for our country .	-1.6874
“ It is nothing we can only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , director of Southern California Assn . of Government that plans to record the miles in all California drivers in the state from 2025 .	-5.2347
The way in which we pay these taxes will change .	-2.1830
Technology is there .	-1.0960
The initiative comes at a time when the High-way Trust Fund , which is financed from the taxes that US Americans are paying at the pump , is bankrupt .	-5.6564
But in America , no longer much is being kicked up .	-4.4909
Cars use less petrol .	-1.9096
State oil taxes of 18.4 cents per moon ( less than 4 euro per litre ) have not increased for 20 years .	-3.6335
Politicians don ’ t dare at high fuel prices to raise the tax by just one cent .	-4.5272
“ The gas tax is simply not sustainable , ” said Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.3334
He has recently equipped 500 cars with a tachograph to test a me-based payment system .	-4.1338
“ That is the most sensible long-term alternative , ” he said .	-2.3762
bureaucrats call it a meier based user fee .	-3.2926
It is not surprising that the idea is found in urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-friendly emissions .	-8.6234
The Californian planners rely on the system in devising strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally agreed climate change goals .	-4.8812
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , chairman of the House Transport Committee , has also stated that he sees the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.6498
The Reson Foundation 's free marketers are also credited with the idea of being able to pay drivers in the direction of a previous race .	-7.3569
“ This is no tax that disappears into a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice President of Reson ’ s policy .	-4.2672
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.4361
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers who , in a report in 2011 , called on Congress to move toward far-based reckoning .	-3.7738
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million worth of pilot project , covering 10,000 cars .	-3.9582
But the majority in the House of Representatives avoided the push and responded to the concerns of members from rural areas who represent people who often have to leave many miles on their way to work or town in everyday life .	-5.6904
Several states and major cities are nevertheless taking their own lead in this direction .	-3.2503
The most committed is Oregon , which currently holds 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-4.4572
These drivers will soon pay the mileage charges instead of the tax on crude oil in the state .	-7.1223
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.8852
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-1.8241
Illinois is testing it in limited quantities .	-4.0886
And the I-95-coalition , including 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-4.3483
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.0740
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently provided with devices , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-3.5729
“ Concern against Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” says Aluddin Khan , head of strategic and earnings management at the Ministry of Transport of Nevada .	-5.0916
People did not want it .	-1.3233
When the test arrived , the CapLU warned of Nevada on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into mature monitoring devices . ”	-5.5835
There is no need to build a gigantic , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data about the daily movements of individuals .	-3.4374
Nevada is one of a number of states now holding off to affordable technology , with which the state can capture the fuelled kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-5.4098
So , Khan , the public would be more reassuring .	-2.7008
Hunting this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.6101
The company was not initially helping states to tax drivers .	-4.0887
Rather , it was their goal to be part of an emerging market for car insurance companies , where drivers should pay based on the secure miles .	-6.1001
But the devices tested by them are also interesting for the road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information regularly uploaded via modem .	-4.5540
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , CEO of True Mileage .	-3.2847
Some of these public pilot programmes made great mistakes .	-2.9232
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-3.0800
In Oregon , the planners experiment with giving drivers a number of options .	-2.8201
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.3336
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a lump-sum fee based on the average mileage held by all residents of the state .	-5.2940
Others hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing devices with more functions than they used .	-3.8287
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a tax device that also pays for parking fees , only pays for safely surfing kilometres and charges of speed data from other vehicles in real time , enabling drivers to avoid congestion .	-8.7579
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers , ” it means in a city ’ s planning document .	-4.0017
However , some hauliers wonder whether the whole talk about pay per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-5.2682
The metropolitan transport Commission for the San Francisco Bay Area officials said that Congress could resolve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel tax .	-5.6692
An additional one-time charge or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-5.3083
“ There is no reason for an operation when an aspirin is sufficient , ” says Randy Renter , the head of Commission legislation and public affairs .	-4.4889
If we do this , hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .	-2.7192
Königsfeld : Small team beats Wacker	-2.3750
The volunteers managed fire fighting their autumn main test , despite lack of human resources .	-4.1888
Only 11 men took part in the exercise .	-1.3619
Hans Kammerer , head of department at the Burgberger street in his traineeship .	-8.9538
The exhibition will be published soon .	-5.5967
Two people were injured as a result of the fire and smoke development , but one could still send an emergency call .	-5.8451
After the first examination of the situation by Hans Kammer , two ambulance guards of the Wehr made the building ready to enter .	-5.5056
After a short period of time , it managed to find the first person and go to the free .	-4.4743
The second person had to be worn .	-0.7681
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.3364
The building , a workshop with integrated Stalin for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.8085
It stored a lot of wood and even forcefully balloons in it .	-4.6407
Furthermore there were electric machines for wood processing .	-2.8338
The first deletion was done via the tank in the vehicle .	-3.5499
Another guided tour was over a flood hydrated at about 100 meters distance .	-5.3677
Now there were three possible fire extinguishers .	-3.1831
A hollow walkway was used also in the building .	-4.2641
Hans Kammer also sought to identify with the exercise what is to be done with underavailable personnel .	-5.6130
In the worst case there is support from the Königsfeld daily mission group .	-4.9989
The commander was satisfied with the outcome of the exercise .	-1.9744
Setting up universities and firms	-3.1413
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarwald district , landlord Guido Wolf also visited Titisee Neustadt to explain where the workers come from tomorrow .	-6.6045
In the Ruhrswalwald funding centre , he addressed this important issue together with the leading professional teachers of the Appeal Schools as well as the district gymnast and the parent 's chairman .	-9.1430
" Education is an important location factor " , Claudia Stablet , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked educational project High-Black Forest ( education centre ) .	-6.1566
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education .	-2.7392
Since 2011 , there has been successful co-operation between train centre , district gymnastics and professional training centre in the Gelderstadt region .	-6.4777
He also praised the family friendliness in the district .	-3.7196
" It is important not only to look at the family phase , but also because of the demographic change the phase to care for relatives , " says Wolf .	-4.8337
He also said that more and more workers were caring and caring for their families .	-3.9122
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees may result in an termination of the employment relationship , " Wolf said .	-4.2607
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers , he said .	-2.5081
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.2283
" For those who have experienced the benefits of the region during his studies , his acquired knowledge and skills often remain in the regional economy , which helps to strengthen the region , " the President of the country was convinced .	-6.8898
Only if adequate training places were offered can the necessary expertise be met .	-5.3393
In his opinion , the Landberg location advantage is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.5684
He also witnessed the efforts already made to develop local public transportation on his journey from Titisee New Town to Freiburg .	-5.6385
" Stay stubborn and make sure that public transport is better , " he told the local politicians present .	-5.7107
Experience music in an entertaining afternoon	-2.4607
For 15 years now , the family Kaul has been invited to a coffee , cake and afterwards to a .	-4.8839
In the past , older fellow citizens were hung in the restaurant .	-4.2660
In the meantime , this afternoon takes place in St. Josef ’ s nursing home .	-6.0873
The locals were happy to see the delicious cakes and cakes .	-3.4443
Later there was cold air .	-3.0515
With popular melodies , Silvia Kimeric-Bantle and her father , Karl Kimmmich , were born .	-6.9474
The more than 100 years old natural stone walls as the front delimitation of the old school to the Kirchstraße in front of the renovation will once again be set with the renovation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-7.6780
In the days before the big , a small angular wall wall was built during the first work of the renovation of the front school school , to stabilize and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrode .	-5.9419
The next step is to include Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbaut , the National Heritage Board in the planning stages , and to create a restoration concept for the old wall .	-8.4704
A calculation of costs is to be carried out by experts , which will then be put on the table to the municipal council for the decision and the further action to be taken .	-9.4697
A decision on this will probably come next year .	-4.5215
After the reorganisation , loading and planting of the old school house within the two sides of the school built in 1912 , it must be considered a follow-up measure in the foreseeable future , which in need of the wall to be sanated and laid to new substructures .	-9.8432
The historic , one-hundred years old Abstractions wall of the old school to the Kirchstraße , is particularly affected by water and frost damages , since no drainage is present , needs renovation and has an archetypal tendency forward .	-8.8713
Deep cracks in single stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently under construction .	-4.3794
A fixed wall is a requirement for a schoolyard student , which has been fixed by the current time .	-6.7873
The original school layout was planned even in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure caused a shift .	-4.7278
An important word in the historical school mauction , which has even been used for film-taking , will be the national monument .	-7.2844
If your guidelines come from this page , then the city of Bräunlingen hopes to receive grants from the thinkers .	-5.9762
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School , which are now being taught in a well-reconstructed old school building with new Aula , will soon be able to use the old school school school school . are , , , , , , and , , and , , , , ,	-9.3682
Özemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart	-2.8404
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg , Cem Özemir , the chairman of the Greens , has now joined forces .	-6.0136
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training in the Stuttgart Musikhochschule , " said Özemir den " Stuttgart News " .	-4.1008
Jazz and classical are just a part of Stuttgart 's jazz scene .	-4.3368
Thus , Mr Özemir , who is a favorite for a direct candidate at the federal election on September 22 , is opposed to the Green Red Landes government .	-7.9308
On the basis of an expert study , this task forces a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-5.1474
The course is planned to shift jazz and pop from the University of Music in Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim . are and . are , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.6978
US border : discovered ' Super-Tunnel ' on drug smuggling .	-3.6745
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and shut down a ' super-tunnel ' to drug smuggling .	-2.8505
As the US customs authorities said , the more than 500 meters long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , train tracks and an ventilation system .	-4.1042
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine confiscated .	-2.5138
The tunnel was not yet in use , as stated .	-4.3259
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could be excavated across the radar , " said the Attorney General of the US District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a warehouse in San Diego , where an end of the tunnel was discovered .	-5.4772
On the drug gangs , Duffy asserted : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-7.3167
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drugs cartels .	-2.2298
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with the crime of drugs .	-2.4912
Designed by Experts	-2.3259
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place about a year .	-3.7345
The sliding system was so equipped that electric vehicles could be used there .	-3.9494
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building that is 80 metres from the border .	-5.8347
According to the authorities , one head takes the depth of 20 meters to the actual tunnel spectrum .	-4.9097
The tunnel has a section of 1.20 meters of height and 90 centimetres width .	-2.0265
It would also have been suitable for promoting illegal immigration towards the US .	-3.9266
Two suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine trade .	-3.0461
The third , a Mexicans , was taken because of the laminated Marihuana .	-3.0729
All three are threatening life imprisonment as a maximum sentence , as officials have said .	-4.1783
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , there was still a press conference in San Diego .	-3.4993
It is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel building .	-3.1417
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller amounts , not tunnels .	-2.3739
This demonstration shows the " desperation " of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , says Bill Sherman of the DEA drug coup in San Diego .	-5.2374
They would do everything to get to the US .	-1.4600
No details were given to arrested , at least one was Mexicans , it was said .	-3.2591
They must reckon with prison sentences of up to ten years .	-1.3391
2014 ’ s Geisinger Festyear	-3.8465
The anniversary of the city of Geising on the occasion of the 1250 .	-3.0910
The return of the first obvious mention is approaching .	-4.6064
When the year ends in a good eight weeks , the anniversary will come to an end .	-4.7850
Geising and church houses were first mentioned in 794 .	-2.7607
In churches a document was produced which both places are mentioned .	-4.7981
On March 15 there will be an official competition for the anniversary year , and as Geisingen currently has no hall , this event will take place in the place where , for the first time in 1250 years , both were mentioned in church houses .	-7.2444
During the anniversary several events are planned both in violins and in church houses .	-3.9392
The 1250 church houses are built in July on a festive weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-6.3778
Confusion is celebrating . and .	-4.9443
On Friday with a fixed act , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival round the church hall .	-3.9647
The church house is also fixed during this festivities .	-4.5744
The city music director Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is listed on three dates .	-5.4747
On June 21 , together with the Sonnwendfesgiving ceremony of the Black Forest Association , on July 12 in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 , the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-6.2394
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary of the year , the official date is the last September weekend , the 27th and 28th of September .	-5.4393
A new chronicle is issued for the anniversary of the Geisinger Stadtjuist .	-5.8709
" It is said to be a chronicle not only by violins themselves , but by a printed work on the violin of today , which is made up of violins , church houses , Leipzig , Aulfingen and Gutmaddingen " , thus Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-7.9669
And the violin of today ’ s 2014 birthday was held in 1974 .	-5.3205
The new chronicle will be presented in Geising on 21 or 22 November in the new Festhalle .	-3.8049
But 2014 is another year with many jubilee .	-2.9312
The Narrenzuft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a brewery evening on the occasion of its 60 year existence , the harmony Gutmaddingen will be 90 years and has celebrated the Festbanquet on 29 March and then celebrates the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-8.8815
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been on the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10 , the Musikverein Polyhymia Leipzig is celebrating 150 years old and is celebrating this in the context of the BrunneFestes from July 4th to 7th .	-7.5933
The city of Geising was first mentioned in a gift certificate owned by the St. Gallen Monastery in 764 .	-4.1910
The certificate was made in churches ( houses ) , which was the place of jurisdiction at the time .	-3.4331
So both communities are mentioned in the same document .	-2.3298
To celebrate this 1250-year anniversary in 2014 , the municipal reform has also been back 40 years .	-4.6429
The Council is targeting slippery policy .	-4.0929
Should the train transition " Am Hirschen " be extensively remodelled to increase traffic safety ?	-4.5367
Yes , the municipal councils decided .	-2.2098
Shiftash must take EUR 220 000 in hand for this .	-4.7350
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal-route next year .	-4.3128
Mainly intended to increase safety on rail trains - regular trains arrive across Germany .	-6.9437
If communities vote to reconstruct , they will have to contribute to the costs of one-third , the rest will share the train and the federal government .	-6.9461
Local councillors Roland Greek have explained the specific characteristics of the Bahnmessen " am Hirschen " .	-6.9600
There , the city plans to build an analysis in the amount of the tunnel cover to the west of the railway tracks there .	-6.1031
There , too , larger vehicles , such as those carrying wheelchairs , could stand by the wayside , without the need to block the rails .	-6.3478
Greek holders therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could join the road in due course in order to ensure smooth flow of traffic .	-5.7211
This was controversial in the municipal council , because some councils doubted the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , with his statement , brought the mood of critics to the point : ' Do we need to take so much money in the hands of so few vehicles ? '	-6.7656
Mayor Thomas Haas said : The transfer of train " Hirschen " is used regularly for the transport of wood .	-5.0634
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported through this route , because up to 20 metres of vehicles could not use the route on the Häuberlesbridge because they could not turn into the main road there .	-5.6186
Moreover , the route served as a transit route for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-4.3135
It should be noted that Kirchberg and Schlossbergoren had to be renovated and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , that the railway transfer " Am " Hirschen " could also be an important transport factor for a longer period of time .	-7.7842
The Councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the intended broadening of the road .	-3.9196
Despite this , a majority of the subsidies were agreed to the reconstruction of the railway transfer system in accordance with the requirement for the construction of the supporting wall in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstraße " , if necessary for meeting traffic at around 5.5 meters .	-9.3159
By contrast , the reconstruction of the train transfer in the Brautwein Trautwein could cause a very different problem , which concerns the passage into the very rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-8.5035
The administration had examined the outline plans of the train from the engineering office , Brenlinger , because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser route was still possible .	-8.0894
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not to be excluded that the state of government could cause longer vehicles to rise .	-6.3915
In turn , the city bears responsibility for this as a road building property .	-4.6816
The reconstruction can therefore ask for liability disputes .	-3.5581
As both the logging and the departure worked in the current state of construction , if you don 't agree to the conversion of the train , Haas argued .	-7.3418
Also here the risk of a collision of turn with a vehicle on the transition is much lower than the other rail routes , because directly next to the center stop where there is a good visual link .	-8.4999
Even trains from the main station should have been so slow at this point that no collision threat .	-4.5774
Most of the time , the reconstruction of this railway system was refused to accept the agreement , since the city of Schildach had to “ “ worry ” the problem with running vehicles , so the wheels could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work has been completed .	-10.8878
As unproblematic , the body considers the rebuilding on the railway tracks " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which the already separate agreements were reached by train .	-9.1354
Esa decides on big space missions : billions of missions .	-3.7223
Far away planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts in the European space agency must now agree on two major projects that they will start in the next few years .	-4.2120
30 proposals were on the selection , five are still in the race .	-2.7202
Far from the world .	-1.8847
More than a thousand planets at other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.5276
No one knows whether there are at least some of them .	-2.6478
The selection is hard : Should you search for gravitational waves ?	-3.6100
Or rather explore the origin of cosmos ?	-1.4000
Or after the warlike planet fahnden and thus perhaps discover extra-terrestrial life ?	-4.8203
These are the questions which are currently being asked by the European Space Agency Esa .	-3.9672
For their Cosmic Vision programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will significantly advance research .	-4.9167
The budget for such " L-missions " is each about one billion euros .	-3.3078
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.8063
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-1.5967
There were 30 ideas for the debate , five of them have now come into the closer election .	-4.9516
Many bodies have mentioned the proposals , while researchers are still waiting for them .	-5.4695
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Committee .	-3.7614
The Esa has selected four major questions to find answers to the mission of the 2007 Cosmic Vision program .	-5.4127
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.6233
The exact procedures in the formation of stars from large gas cloud - and thus also the creation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-5.6504
A large infrared telescope in the All could push through this dark .	-4.4993
And when a star has a planet in which circumstances can life arise ?	-4.6299
In order to follow this question , in 2017 , the " Cheops " space telescope will be launched , which will examine more closely 500 well known planetary systems in our surroundings .	-6.5852
But the possibilities are limited , Cheop is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.4622
With larger instruments , astronomers could form damning planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , thus looking for " biomarkers " : gas that are considered to be an indication of biological activity .	-6.7970
How does the solar system work ?	-0.7943
This question should also ultimately provide information on the conditions for the development of life .	-4.4951
An important role is the magnetic activity of an star and the interplay of its magnetic field and the partial radiation of its origin with the planetary system .	-5.5141
In our solar system these processes can be investigated by example .	-4.4314
With the " Solar Orbiter " the Esa has already approved an M-class mission ( there the budget is about EUR half a billion ) for this question .	-5.0048
The probe is meant to start in 2017 and watch the solar ’ s surface and activity carefully .	-3.8472
Of great interest to researchers , so are Jupiter and his Monde .	-3.4377
You want to know the role of the giant planet in the development of the solar system .	-3.9478
For this , the Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme .	-4.5350
The Sonde " Judice " ( Jupiter Icon Explorer ) begins their journey probably 2022 .	-4.9214
Eight years later , she reaches Jupiter and is to examine the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moon of Europe , Kallito and Ganymed .	-5.1234
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.8236
The universe offers many opportunities to study subject matter under extreme conditions and to study whether the laws known to us are still valid there .	-5.8357
You may also find deviations that might guide the physicists towards a new theory , among which all known laws unite .	-6.8701
What was the universe created and what is it ?	-2.7598
It was 13.7 billion years ago that our cosmos emerged from .	-3.2741
In addition to the frequently used subject , from the stars , planets and creatures we exist , there is Dunk matter , whose gravity is quarried by galaxies and galaxies , and Dark Energy , which greatly accelerates the expansion of the space .	-9.1495
So far , the researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first split second of the big bang , nor about the background matter and dark energy .	-7.3108
With Euclid , the Esa has already approved an M-mission for 2020 .	-3.9000
With a special telescope , the probe is intended to examine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time and thus enable conclusions to be made about the nature of Dunkert matter and Dunkeller Energy .	-7.5918
Who could make the race	-2.0965
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.7459
In the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , the best chances for certification as the L-mission is a demanding concept for detecting gravitational waves .	-5.9095
Thereof , physicists understand changes in the spatial structure that preceded Albert Einstein almost 100 years ago .	-5.1171
They have not been reproduced to date .	-2.8195
Elisa could do that , hoping the scientists behind the project .	-2.9170
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes that is stationary in the All .	-5.8318
In contrast to systems on the earth , it could prove that gravitational waves created at the stroke , providing new insights into the origins of cosmos .	-7.4991
Four other proposals still compete for the second L-mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which aims , among other things , to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the external planet of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to assess the cosmic background , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is to be reconsidered and examined .	-10.5655
The proposal for the return of the Mars test system , for the exploration of the moon , Venus and Asteroids , as well as the solar physics .	-7.4065
Snowden willing to cooperate with Germany on US surveillance .	-2.4354
Edward Snowden , the chairman of the US intelligence agency , has stated that he is ready to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag , when the US National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities .	-5.3650
The German Member , Hans-Christian Ströbeli , met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum has been granted , to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-5.0783
In a letter from Snowden , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , he writes : “ Even if the result of my efforts has been proven positive , my government continues to treat a different opinion as a fiduciary and a breach of the criminalisation of political expression with the threat of punishment , in which no defence is possible . ”	-7.3328
To tell the truth is not a crime .	-1.7147
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American Government to abandon the charges .	-4.2165
The charges issued by the US Department of Justice include sponage and theft of state assets .	-3.1826
The German Minister of the Interior , Mr Hans-Peter Friedrich , said about time Online : ‘ If Mr Snowden is ready to speak with German representatives , we will find ways to do that . ’	-4.9630
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that NSA has missed Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.6274
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who is chairing the parliamentary committee responsible for secret service , said that it is important to take the opportunity to listen Snowden as a witness , if this is possible , ‘ without threatening it and completely destroying relations with the US ’ .	-7.2277
Strupre , a member of the Greens , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter album .	-4.7590
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.1856
Struggle explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA staff , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-4.4818
If Snowden points in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , as the honourable Member says .	-3.6960
Snowden , in his letter , said that he faced a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that has driven him from his home country .	-4.7227
It is , however , touching on the global response to ‘ my act of political expression ’ .	-2.5507
Citizens around the world , as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a credit to the general public .	-4.2016
In his letter , Snowden ’ s German authorities are offering cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-4.0601
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-2.2388
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to 100 US dollars of passengers who wish to depart on their flight of hand baggage . , , etc , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.5262
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of handbaggage and $ 2 for coffee or Limonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers should keep the full dose .	-4.3657
The new charge applies to hand luggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .	-3.2953
Frontier explained that it costs USD 25 if the charge is paid in advance and USD 100 for passengers only paid at the steward .	-6.1029
Frontier Speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the $ 100 fee involved in getting travelers to pay in advance .	-5.4021
" We don 't want to calculate this sum , " she explained .	-2.6279
Airlines began in 2008 to demand charges for the first and second piece of baggage . the were , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.5975
As a result , passengers who tried to circumvent them have fallen into their hand baggage as much as possible , which means that bags are often overpacked above the seat .	-6.0084
Fees are a way of getting passengers less on board .	-2.1597
O 'Malley said it 's not really about making money on the new charge .	-4.2106
We are talking about the most faithful clients of Frontier , who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the field above the seat .	-6.1300
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay for it . are , , and .	-5.2510
This means that a passenger may take a bag free of charge on the front-plane , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable bag .	-4.6855
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed , so that passengers should be informed about the cost before they arrive to the plane .	-6.4534
The new baggage fee of Frontier will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no date yet .	-5.1887
Passengers often travel through baggage allowances and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to it .	-4.2361
You argue that the transportation of the luggage cost money and passengers should pay this service if they desired it .	-4.9661
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .	-4.2835
However , most of them so far leave the fingers of charges on hand baggage .	-5.2212
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago the first charge for hand luggage and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-6.5842
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizzle Air , announced by Airline Consultant Jay Sorensen , who pays attention to additional charges .	-4.7129
In a report of December 2011 , he estimated that the hand baggage bill bill will bring $ 50 million per year .	-5.3483
Sorensen who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines has recently flown Spirit and has been curious about what would expect him at the airshow if passengers are faced with the company ’ s unusual handbaggage fee .	-9.3069
“ The Boarding Process was one of the most deservedly I experienced in my aerial career , ” he said .	-3.7265
I expected to see teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth teeth and tangible discussions on the platform .	-5.5006
“ The aircraft was full , ” he explained , “ and the board was as smashed . ”	-2.7647
Frontier is also following the $ 2 that is required for coffee , tea , Limonade or juice .	-3.7733
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or juice should keep the whole can and coffee filled free of charge .	-4.9464
Water remains free .	-1.5049
US Airways tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008 , but it later reversed it seven months after passenger charges and no other large society had waned .	-6.8160
Frontier step to charge handbaggage fees if passengers do not purchase directly from the airline is the latest initiative aimed at placing customers on their own website .	-5.0664
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-2.4874
This will give all companies an incentive to move passengers to purchase them directly instead of via an online travel agency .	-4.0895
Frontier has , however , gone furthest in this area .	-2.1805
In September , the company began to offer only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency .	-4.6790
On Wednesday , the miles were once again reduced to 25 % of the flight .	-2.9697
For this reason , a flight with Frontier , which is booked with a third party , will cost only 250 miles .	-6.6700
Passengers can also reserve seats for direct purchase on the website of Frontier .	-3.3473
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-3.1041
The revenue fell by 9 % , and the capacity of flight decreased nearly 13 % in the first quarter , as stated in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republican Airways Holdings Inc .	-5.2952
Republic has tried to control the finances of Frontier within the framework of the sale of society .	-4.8334
Greetings from the Bible	-3.3883
Very 40 women attended the last women ’ s early piece of this year in the evangelical church community of Bishop .	-5.3777
The subject of the day in the townhouse were entitled ' Songs of the Bible ' and ' medieval speeches ' .	-5.7721
After breakfast , Zita Köhler , the Chairman of the Church Ministry of the Council , received a word on the biblical sayings in a talk .	-6.2446
Say words contain CVs , rules , or warnings , she explained .	-4.1337
She compared several sayings with the relevant beads and explained the meaning .	-6.7177
Say words like : Holzauge is vigilant as folds come from the eyes , throwing an eye on someone who is the Lord ’ s feet in sleep , washing his hands into innocence .	-7.7065
Several times the speakers also told their listeners what proverb they were doing .	-6.0201
The wordings from the Middle Ages were made by the parish figures in Christel Dehner : All good things are three , blue , do some .	-7.3346
She explained the importance and origin of the speech that she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-3.6607
A raffle was finally released .	-2.8102
The prices were deposited on a table and were translocated before being handed over to the winners .	-5.2253

Learning instead of unemployed : The pilot project for Unelected in Tourism	-5.1027
Today a pilot project for the tourist industry is started at the Mecklenburg Seenplate .	-3.9381
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men , who are already working as an accident in the industry , are expected to become professionals for hotels and restaurants for over three winter .	-6.4093
" What is new is that the six months of courses with degrees , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Employment Agency .	-4.8189
The benefits are varied : the participants would not be unemployed , the workers who would become more and more skilled in hotels and restaurants , and the agency should not fund unemployment .	-6.6059
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel- und Gasstättenverband ( Dehaga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-4.5416
NSA explains that a “ internal error ” and not hackers are the fault of the site ’ s crash .	-3.2167
The shady National Security Agency said on Friday that an error had paralysed its public site a few hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-5.6278
“ NSA.gov had not been available for some hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in a message sent via e-mail .	-5.4238
The problem will be resolved this evening .	-2.6815
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-3.1629
In the early hours , online tracking had appeared that the NSA site was not accessible for at least six hours , and for some users it is still not possible .	-5.6327
Prior to that , a NSA spokesman on ABC News declared that the sensitive internal network of the Agency is “ in no way ” compromised .	-4.6915
secret information is not in danger , as the speaker says .	-3.4339
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-3.1792
In the event of such attacks , the destination website is flooded with a side call until the server is overloaded and the site breaks down .	-4.0502
Cybertactic is relatively simple , and the attacks do not serve to invade the internal network of the target system .	-3.3628
The former superSecret NSA , whose nickname once called No Search Agency ( no such authority ) , is now found in the light of the public , and after the revelations that have been published in recent months about its extensive internal and foreign surveillance program – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disenchanted former NSA Edward Snowden .	-7.2124
The growing controversy over the secret service raised initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyclone operation .	-3.4897
The number of people without jobs fell by 22 to 1.307 in October .	-2.8770
Although the ratio of 3.1 % was better than last year and better than in September , " we had hoped for more , " Monika Felder-Bauer , deputy manager of the agency for work in Sonthofen , says .	-5.2165
Many companies have reacted to settings so far .	-3.3337
One reason for this is , according to Felder-Bauer : " We have hardly any skilled workforce in the craft sector , in the health sector and in the care of the elderly " .	-4.7240
Since September , the company has been reorganising jobs for staff in the hotel and catering industry .	-5.3028

Removing Bombardier ’ decline in delivery figures and orders	-5.9460
On Thursday , Canada ’ s aircraft and rail producer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percentage drop in net earnings after having been under pressure from lower orders and deliveries on aircraft in the third quarter and contract problems in the railway market .	-6.0695
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also did not publish air test data for his brand new SCSI aircraft , and did not give any new information on whether the aircraft could be used for commercial purposes in accordance with the ambitious timetable for next September .	-8.3489
Only three additional starches were subsequently subsequently subsequently subsequently subsequently taken on the maiden flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is as planned .	-7.3704
The results fell short of the forecast and led to a drop of more than 8 % on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-5.6356
Cameron Doerksen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , presented his review of “ outperform ” to “ Sector perform ” on Thursday with a limited share in the next one to two quarters .	-5.6766
“ Although weaker delivery figures were widely expected at aircraft , we are clearly disappointed by the margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-6.4908
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeri when the aircraft test program is proceeding .	-5.1729
If , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-4.6376
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft series can inject the company into the lower market segment now dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-3.6522
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and was first released in September after months of delay .	-2.5476
However , up to now , binding orders for the CSeri are at 177 moderate , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company 's claims concerning fuel efficiency and cost savings in the new jet aircraft are appropriate .	-7.0936
At present there are 403 orders and pledges made by 15 customers and companies .	-2.3654
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the start of commercial use .	-3.5417
In addition , the company ’ s management assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was in the timetable .	-5.9199
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the plane ’ s standing time had been equipped with ground tests and software updates .	-5.8087
Each manufacturer plans different .	-2.1607
We have decided to take a first flight and then hang on to a transitional period what we did .	-4.6271
This is happening throughout the entire flight programme .	-3.1577
The second five test aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks , the rest soon afterwards , it was said from the company side .	-4.8940
Nonetheless , analysts remain skeptical of whether the first customer can use an aircraft of the CSOs twelve months after the successful Jung flight .	-6.4095
Bombardier announced that it will review the plan for start-up ( EIS ) and will update them in the coming months .	-5.2041
“ We believe that the slow progress of air tests – even if they obviously comply with bombings of internal planning – strengthens our view that start-up will move to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-5.9526
In the third quarter , at the end of September , Bombardier ’ s net profit was $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of 172 million , or $ 9 cents per share in the previous year .	-4.6713
The customized win per share is unchanged 9 cents .	-2.9967
Sales decreased slightly from 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.8175
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , according to Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.7822
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer , delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-4.8549
Net orders declined from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.9316
The order book in the aerospace market was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September , unchanged over 31 December .	-3.8225
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were disappointing in our targets , but the low order intake and market balance were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-5.1218
Sales in the aerospace market fell by 13 % to two billion dollars .	-2.2075
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway producer , has announced that sales in this saving have risen by almost 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.6973
The order book in the transport market was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September , slightly increased compared to 31 December .	-4.1707
The volume of profit in the field of transport was affected by problems of settlement in some major contracts .	-5.4888
According to company management there will be new guidelines for the fourth quarter .	-3.0544
In the subsequent trading on Thursday , Bombardier ’ s share decreased by 8.5 % , and was at $ 4.83 Canadian , even after it was announced that the Google Finance Board will change Patrick Pichette .	-7.3386
On Thursday , the Brazilian Embassy in SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombings in the world , reported a 10 % decline in the quarterly income .	-5.1170

Kokain-dependent lawyer who warned drug bosses against police investigation must be released in prison .	-4.6945
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information on the size of Neil Scarborough .	-4.1736
The lawyer was afraid that his domestic drug dependence could come to light .	-2.2706
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool court .	-2.5215
A well-known criminal agent who warned a drug baron of a large police investigation because he was afraid to expose his secret drug addiction was sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.9851
Basharat Ditta , 42 , furnished sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on its activities in the drug trade after having compromised its own cocaine approach .	-5.8748
The lawyer , named by criminals as “ first-class ” , with the nickname “ Bash ” , was arrested in 2011 in his house , after the police had monitored Scarborough , who had been represented in a previous drug proceeding .	-7.0342
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the home of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , during which he was a member of the bar bar bar .	-5.8307
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs in class A after trace of cocaine had been found in his hair on his wallet and credit cards in tests .	-5.2778
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorized information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.6695
All four suspected suspected persons were monitored by the police at the time as part of a major investigation proceedings relating to the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire , and West Yorkshire .	-5.0249
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police secured a number of Herin and Kokain ’ s domestic searches at <unk> 1.5 million , and <unk> 200,000 in cash .	-5.8983
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he believed that his addiction could be a shame .	-5.1931
Today , Dimetta , working for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted at Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial of two charges of obstruction of justice .	-5.1329
In a previous survey , he gave possession of cocaine .	-3.9560
The lawyer was overrun after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular contact with Dietta in February 2011 .	-3.7341
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas ’ s house , where drugs , with a purity of 60 % , were placed under the rubbish bin of the lawyer .	-6.3917
Shortly after he left the drugs , Scarborough spoke regularly with Ditta , who was in charge of dinner at the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood .	-5.1523
The lawyer returned home , and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-2.6469
Before the courts , it was known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine , after tests of class A drugs had been discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-6.1257
Dietta was arrested later , but denied taking cocaine and saying that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that his discussion was “ attorneys ’ secrets . ”	-6.8065
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were assured and taken from him a hairtest .	-4.9309
In the police briefing , he told that he would call an office and client at home for legal matters , both in and in the workplace .	-6.8200
It was known before the courts that he had announced important drug-trafficking agents , some of whom had previously been represented , after significant arrests and informed of what the investigators knew about them .	-6.7308
Citizenship Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal law lawyer should know better than everyone else that the law is not breaking . ”	-4.6730
Dietta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender , because he has admitted himself too much with certain clients .	-6.2179
The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-2.4632
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , for he was the lawyer of these people .	-3.9111
But that went far beyond the boundaries of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.5206
He looked at the police investigation as far as possible , so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities .	-4.1867
Mr Dimetta thereby brought his profession to disrepute .	-3.6609
He was too close to certain clients , particularly Scarborough , and he allowed its independence to be compromised .	-3.9949
Dicta pointed out any misconduct by himself , claiming that if I were a corrupt lawyer , which I was not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait for 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-6.6473
But after the hearing he said super powerful Lee Halstead from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta did the step from a criminal agent to a crime at the moment when he began to purchase organised criminals . ”	-6.0226
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeful compromise , making it receptive to the motives of leading members of organized crime in charge of providing valuable information about police investigations .	-5.3197
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-2.1636
Dimetta has betrayed that trust and tried to entrench itself behind the facade of his profession .	-4.7569
The Serious and organised Crime Unit of Lancashire launched an investigation against Ditta , which also led to a condemnation in three cases of the possession of cocaine and justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-5.2019
This case should be a warning to criminals and demonstrates that no one can escape the arm of the law .	-3.6211
We will find you and bring you to the courts .	-1.7907
Scarborough itself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after proclaiming guilty of the conspiracy on heroin , cocaine , and cannabis .	-3.8941
Fifthly , thirty others involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to total penalties of 153 years due to drug offences .	-5.2039
Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself , in which he argues that his dream job as a lawyer to represent clients to the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-7.3290
Revolational work of church music	-1.8443
At the end of the 160-year celebration , the LiederCranz Dunningen will be surrounded by two religious services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-5.6201
After the great success of the Musicals " Rock my Life " , which the audience experienced in the spring of this year , the LiederCraz will end the anniversary of two religious services with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert .	-6.4117
On Saturday 26 October , this extraordinary fair will be heard from 19 during the evening show in St. Martinengen Church and on Sunday , 27 October , from 10.15 a.m. at the St. John Baptiste Church in Lactenendorf .	-6.9767
The so-called German fair , with the original title " Sounds for the celebration of the sacred sacrifice of the fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and at the time it was almost revolutionary .	-6.8379
The exhibition is performed in the context of the services of the Lord , as the principal Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.0924
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the Frohsense Tennenron and Noemi Loodi at the organ .	-3.0976
Haslach : skepticism about growing confidence	-4.1890
For example , the 2015 elections to the parish church will change in the Haslach ( SE ) department of the sea . are and of course the of .	-11.2888
There is then only a common parish for all six parish days .	-4.3622
On Saturday in a joint session the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischbach , Steinach and Welschenkirach prepared the changes .	-5.2551
The fundamental decisions of the diocese have nothing to do with changing and it is up to the parish to implement it as satisfactorily as possible .	-5.9388
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism about the New hesitant is giving way to confidence .	-6.4161
From the ideas and expectations of innovation in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish , the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main concerns of the seafarers were very constructive .	-5.9121
Registrandekan Georg Schmitt explained by a presentation the new directives for seafarers in the archdiocese Freiburg .	-4.9895
After that , the SE Haslach , as a church parish , forms a body of public law that enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far .	-6.4960
There will only be a common parish council and a council of foundations representing the parish 's power .	-5.0915
Each parish should represent at least two elected members , and the six parish teams are formed on the ground .	-6.2426
Her job will be to promote religious life in the village in the future .	-4.2720
Much discussion was then taken on the question of the finances of the individual parish .	-4.4898
The innovations suggest that collected credit will be stored in the jurisdictions .	-6.6558
On the other hand , the liabilities go to the whole community . the the , and . the the the the the the the the .	-7.5435
Particularly with regard to the major planned investments , which then meet all the parish meetings , there were great concerns .	-5.4657
" Even in the past , there has been only investment in projects that could be managed by the local parish itself " , relative hash 's parish chairman , Bruno Prinzbach .	-11.7567
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes identified barbarian knights , the leader of the body in the healing unit Schutterwald-Novied .	-6.5517
They had made a job in 2006 , ' becoming one , five remain ' and had to realise that this is not so easy .	-6.8235
The boards of the Haslacher Soulflyer then decided to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-6.8802
The work has been carried out in other meetings and it will be decided at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-6.1591
At the end , the parish of Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the department of souls , which was voted by a clear majority .	-5.4275
In Pfulendorf , the electricity will become more expensive .	-3.1032
Citizens must adjust to higher electricity costs .	-3.1573
As confirmed by the director of the Municipal Works , Jörg-Arne Bias , against the SF<unk>DKURIER , a four-person family from 70 to 90 euros per year can be found .	-7.4302
The essential reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour .	-3.0001
This arrangement is reestablished every October by the four operators of the major electricity routes .	-5.6809
These figures are the additional costs that they may incur from the energy turnaround by switching over the electricity price .	-5.5405
The town of Pfulendorf is the last link in this chain .	-3.3244
The supervisory board of the energy company , in its forecasts , even assumed a higher levy , as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias .	-5.4058
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before next week ’ s cities could inform their customers about the exact price increase .	-3.7474
" We are going from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , so Bias , where the number will be close to the 2 cents .	-5.0556
Offset to permanent red : Be careful at time of reservation .	-5.8984
Sometimes an ampel is simply not green .	-2.5307
The contact queue in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-3.8579
What should you do - driving at red ?	-3.6416
If a person has waited long enough at a red light and the cross is free , he can continue , explains the local lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " motorcycle " .	-4.7762
But the waiting time must be " reasonable " , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.6801
Becker accuses of running at least five minutes before starting from a functional disruption of the lights .	-5.3473
However , if you continue the trip despite the red light , you must be aware that it is the full fault of an accident caused by this .	-6.9021
Those who condone less than five minutes may not wait long enough , and he warns and points to a decision of the Supreme Mingerlaw Hamm .	-6.8541
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the lights after about three minutes of continuous red and had to answer for a negligent red light infringement .	-5.1436
After all , the lights were not broken , but they jumped to green a little later .	-5.2908
He was spared because of the special situation - but the fine was not .	-5.3430
Regional Council look forward to a solid budget	-3.1943
When it comes to the budget in communal meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laugh well .	-3.8178
The communal lounge in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled , and debt is no longer familiar with the administration since 2005 .	-4.3666
The 2012 financial year can also be considered a success in this sense .	-3.3074
This was clear when the accounts were presented for 2012 .	-3.5365
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget , with some EUR 7.6 million , was over a million more than planned .	-4.6933
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-4.5110
The surplus is due mainly to higher business income and to the community ’ s share of income tax .	-4.2907
The asset budget , too , was clear about planned values .	-3.6281
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.2403
" This is largely due to the increase in administrative expenditure , " says Rothmund .	-5.3803
Since less investment has been made in the financial year 2012 than was planned , the reserve has also been higher .	-3.6722
All in all , the overall reserve has increased by some EUR 2.1 million to now a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-4.7425
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work .	-2.3074
" Such a work is not simply pumped out of the sleeves " , prated with a view to the accounts .	-5.9958
He and the community councils were obviously delighted with the good figures .	-3.0925
It may sound paradoxical , but these good figures could soon be expensive for citizens .	-3.4295
Good finance has allowed the community to renounce high levels of government spending in the past .	-5.2034
In turn , according to Gerster , the country ’ s subsidies have already been cut back on numerous occasions .	-6.3966
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory shocks .	-3.0201
Among other things , cities and communities seeking grants must dictate certain sectors of government .	-6.0356
" We need to look at the subject of heaters because investments are needed in the coming years , for which we would like grants , " Gerster announced in this context .	-6.7096
Nagold : Hugo Boards in the chorus for 60 years .	-2.5151
With 60 years of age as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history is almost twice as long as that of the Herb Festival in which he was honoured .	-5.6915
Hubert ’ s jobs were as usual on stage in the colors of his men ’ s associations .	-4.2583
After 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir that has become more than happy .	-5.1354
In the club , he was also active , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-4.6933
He received several awards for his commitment and the club ’ s determination : Jörg Kohler , Pastoralreferent , on behalf of the Cäciliende Rottenburg-Stuttgart , granted him - since the choir is also a church chor - a certificate signed by the association and a bishop Fürst .	-8.2257
His singer colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German Choral Association and a engraved Zinteller .	-4.7519
In addition to the award , the 31st autumn festival took place on usual tracks : with the MGV amount , LiederCraz Salzstetten , the SängerDepartment Baiingen and the local Musikverein , the Fulmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of choirs and vocal styles , which kept around 400 visitors .	-8.6495
The MGV full-maringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In Wine paradise " and " Maps , their brothers " .	-5.0317
Her honor biter Hubert 's office made her a small boy - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts " Bundeslied " .	-7.2057
The men ’ s monastery amount also sang classical choirs such as Julius Wengermacht , " Far away " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you ran through the valley " .	-6.1854
The LiederCrane z Salzstetten , with his mixed choir and his female group - the " impulse " - created the female rate of the Festival .	-6.1880
The mixed choir led with the Neapolitan Popular " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " by Antos Gus in foreign countries , while the " impulse " also fell to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey de " were included in their program .	-5.0893
The Bainger Sportverein ’ s singer department came back to the local <unk> What the Schwob ? " by Hans Süsmuth and Robert Pappert " Bierlied " where the Breitmaringer Musikverein presented the perfect musical experience .	-9.2396
For the children there was a small side programme - " Oma Hanne " alias Hanneore Stolfeer led a Kasperltheatre and read some stories about the children at noon .	-6.1454

Kenyan press outraged by controversial media law	-2.2439
“ We are in a troubled situation and we should ask ourselves : what does Parliament think of simply abolishing the judiciary ’ s independence tomorrow ” was the paper that considers the draft law to be constitutional .	-6.6037
“ The law is draconian and very criminal , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , director of the Capital Group , which also includes CapitalFM , one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya .	-4.7117
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extension of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.3130
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-3.2229
According to the newspaper The Star , the government has “ effectively attacked the media in a stranglehold . ” By contrast , the standard , democracy , and freedom of speech in Kenya has suffered “ a severe blow , ” and presented the draft as “ draconian ” .	-5.6991
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security after the attacks by armed Islamists on the Western gate shopping mall in September .	-3.9004
The Kenyan media attacked the authorities ’ anger , because they published recordings of security cameras on which to see how the units that were dispatched to the site allegedly corrupted the luxurious shopping mall .	-6.4406
Police leader David Kimaiyo reacted to this by signing two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the charge was withdrawn after a media ramp-up .	-6.6726
According to the new law , media houses can be subject to a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shills , and individual journalists with up to one million , as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-4.9038
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected when a penalty is not paid .	-2.9573
According to Daily Nation , “ one single penalty can push most radio stations in bankruptcy . ”	-3.2658
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating impact on what it is describing as “ vibrant blogosphere ” Kenya .	-4.8119
If they muzzle the media , politicians could do with impunity whatever they want .	-2.3821
“ No one will ever experience it , ” Mutuma Mathiu wrote , journalist at the nation , who describes Kenyan media as a critical factor in public life .	-5.3969
“ Boundary politicians themselves , run the country in bankruptcy and return to the days of the hunters and gatherers , ” he commented .	-5.0087
In the past , the Kenyan legislator shook public anger .	-3.2712

The official training party for the artificial turf scene , despite the cold weather and rain , did not bear any importance for the city and the football club .	-6.8708
A more pleasant holiday , everyone had probably wanted last Saturday , but Peter didn 't want to play with it .	-6.4998
So all those who came without a umbrella or had not been able to hold such a thing for any reason .	-6.1971

Mayor Klumpp reminded us that repeated witting influences in spring and autumn allowed the original lawn place to be played .	-6.9617
15 years ago , we had the first thoughts about solving the problem when we were thinking of building a third place at the football club site or at the real school at the Salinensee .	-6.5674
Both have been rejected again .	-1.6400
Six years ago , thought was given to the establishment of an art centre , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .	-4.5872
Concrete plans were recorded two years ago , when the FC undertook the Shanghai office in Bienpr , pledged a cost of € 100 000 for the construction of the course , and approved the land funding of EUR 104 000 .	-9.0573
The Municipal Council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 in total costs of EUR 560 000 , made Klumpp together .	-4.8261

Vienna Airport organises passenger calls .	-2.4532
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.4309
In future there will be no further notice of how this will be at Vienna .	-4.5231
Most of the loudspeaker reports are gone away - the noise level should be reduced so much .	-5.8599
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this new creation .	-3.2408
As Airport-Speaker Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the recruitment of crossings affecting individuals .	-3.6906

With the absence of this notice - on average , around 200 personal calls from the speakers are drowning on a day - in future it will be more at the airport .	-8.1937

" Good , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-old people found .	-3.3657
But not Jedermanns ’ cause .	-2.7065

UN proclaims new poverty-reduction goals	-6.5912
The United Nations is starting to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals proclaimed 12 years ago for combating poverty .	-4.0317
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in the evening in Rio de Janeiro , Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “ sustainable development goals ” that will replace the Millennium Goals that will expire in 2015 .	-4.2267
They were included in the final draft of the document adopted by world political leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-3.0390
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time has come to think “ beyond national interests . ”	-3.9644
“ I am pleased that member states agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.2123
“ These goals will be built on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-2.9920
I will spare no effort to implement the mandate given to me by member states to realize our vision of the SDGs , which are built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.3732
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days of play , there is still good mood in the Handball Oberlignischen .	-6.7463
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this .	-3.1078
Everyone is still fully motivated .	-3.1923
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.4184
" After all , I don 't even know how a victory is shining , " Malmon expects his team to have a success of VfL Fredenbeck II .	-7.4111
Even though the 3rd Liguria reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet duped trees , Malmon is warning in advance of the pointing .	-8.4029
Many players have trained me in A-youth .	-3.1958
Thus , against their ex-coach , they will surely be very motivated .	-3.7385
" It is also important to see whether there is a further reinforcement from the first part , " the SG-Coach points out .	-6.2242
In order to return to the track of success , the Malone team must certainly increase in comparison with the previous performances .	-6.3217

Security concerns in Mozambique grow as a result of clashes between influential personalities .	-3.8880
Thousands of people were gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state and first President Mozambique to vote in a rare public demonstration of peace calls .	-5.5020
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , manager of an investment company .	-1.7979
For fear for the future of the country , she has exchanged her business clothing against a T-shirt with the labeling “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and signed up on Thursday the crowd at the Independence Square of the capital .	-6.9731
For two weeks now , there have been reports almost daily of a clash between government forces and Renamo , which have been among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-4.6441
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White ruling Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.0332
Following the 1992 Peace Treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.3099
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict , but recent events have fueled concerns from foreign investors and natives .	-4.3532
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge deposits of gas off the coast and coal in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-5.9205
The ruling Frelimmo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-3.2326
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province , a traditional stronghold of Renamos on 17 October .	-4.0097
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakma , the leader of the group , declared Renamos spokesman for the Financial Times .	-5.1970
The government is blaming Renamo for rouping and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-3.7795
President Armando Guebuza has tried to lower concerns about instability .	-1.5162
Against AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama views himself as a “ loser , ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.3679
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.4593
But the concerns have increased since Mazagan has been quoted in the words , Renamo is giving up the 1992 peace agreement .	-5.0859
He said to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement .	-3.7185
“ Our vision is to start negotiations again , ” said Mazinga .	-3.2855
Early discussions among the parties contributed little to solving the tensions that were fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.1470
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who are coming together the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique ’ s expert .	-4.8253
None of them are good in bargaining and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.7792
Renamo , pushing for election reforms , has already stated that it will boycott the municipal elections in November .	-3.2377
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.4792
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt to disrupt the government ’ s concessions and financial benefits .	-3.8383
Renos electoral sequence has been shrinking since 1992 , while a new party , founded by a former Renamo member , Movimiento Democrático de Moçambique ( MDM ) , will probably improve in the elections .	-5.4620
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation comes after his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.7576
“ He doesn ’ t want bipartisan democracy , he doesn ’ t want transparent elections , he doesn ’ t want peace because he doesn ’ t want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazatga .	-4.7627
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made disturbing attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south link .	-3.7205
Most of the fighting took place in the Sofala province , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but which is located at Beirut , the port , the mountain farming areas like Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal .	-6.7697
In June , Rio began to use the railways for a month after Renamo had announced an attack on the track .	-4.0519
Mazagan responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat .	-4.3842
Renamo “ the international community was warning that things in Mozambique are not good , ” said Mazanga .	-3.4577
Instability increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , leader of Medicacoop , an independent media company , because many people were already concerned about corruption , the slow progress in development , and a recent wave of abduction .	-5.9240
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.6672
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-2.6604
“ No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-3.2585
Children should bring myths and legends to “ images of life , ” says an author .	-6.0555
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal power has no chance of clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend show how important it is to have a dream .	-3.4138
Many myths , however , are “ far too great to be wildly , offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools , ” which is why Crossey-Holland is arguing for “ careful choice ” of age-oriented works .	-6.7123
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-2.1155
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years .	-2.1137
He added , with authors and teachers who are “ over-didactic , ” children would “ completely shut ” , because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ underwelded . ”	-4.8671
Crosley Holland , translated from Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and British Folk Tales , declared : “ You can follow certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-5.0634
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.7485
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.4485
It must be presented undertly by history , not by explanation .	-3.7519
This is the old story of the pointing rather than narration .	-3.9549

On Thursday , a federal action court in the United States blocked the order of a judge demanding changes to the stop-and-haircut program ( “ holding and ” ) of the New York Police Department , and sacked the judges .	-6.8796
The second US Supreme Court stated that judges would be subject to Shira Skaldlin ’ s decisions until the city ’ s appeal was ruled .	-6.8252
The judge had begun in August , pushing the city against the constitution with the way in which the program is implemented for holding and asking people .	-5.5222
The city appealed against its assessment and support measures , including the decision to establish a supervisory body to help the police change their directive and the relevant training programme .	-5.4293
The Court of Appeals heard the arguments for a called suspension on Tuesday .	-3.3526
The appeal report states that the judges must be freed from the case because they have breached the Code of Conduct for US judges by deciding that a judge should avoid the appearance of party ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which they publicly responded to the criticism of the court .	-7.7637
The judge had it , police officers violated civil rights from tens of thousands of people because they were unreasonably targeted and target black American men with the stop and hairstyle program .	-5.2572

Advocates of changes to the NYPD program say that the changes will end unfair practices , create more trustworthy and effective police , and influence the way other police officers use the system .	-5.3018
Opponents believe that the changes would undermine the morale of the police , but not crime ; nor would they waste money , nor do they resolve the wider problem of a police force that , following the disappearance of thousands of posts in the last decade , is under pressure .	-6.9927
The judges pointed out that they did not end the stop and hairstyle practice , which was constitutional but only the way in which the NyPD implemented the checks .	-6.5546

Coulson set Tele-Hacking for checking a tips .	-3.8847
The former news of the Word publisher Andy Coulson supposedly “ phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” in an attempt to confirm a false tip about a affair by then-Interior Secretary Charles Clarke .	-6.4654
In May 2005 , prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared a false scaffold rumor to the court in the Old Bailey , News of the World , that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advisor ” Hannah Pawlby .	-5.9998
The newspaper asked the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys Voicemoles , and carried them , but Coulson also called them and left messages as the court learned .	-6.9287
“ According to the public prosecutor ’ s opinion , Coulson , who is now the publisher of the NotW , no one who faces the home of people and hopes to drown in fresh deeds , but one who likes to confront a story to see her response , ” said Edis .	-7.6675
He said that NotW uses three techniques to research stories in investment : phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-4.0833
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.1791
It appears that he knows of the second , the surveillance , it cannot be otherwise .	-4.4739
What about the first ?	-1.6120
Does he know about the phone hacking ?	-2.2775
He disagrees , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-3.2287
Rumours about a affair of Clark were first taken up by the feature editorial of NotW , as a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby , said : “ Do not waste your time , it is together with Charles . ”	-5.7431
A band with voice gestures from their phone of at least three occasions was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-4.9121
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective where Pawlby and her sister were saved as “ projects . ”	-4.0401
In the time when the search was made , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.7889
Meanwhile , former Chief Executive Neville Thurbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the surveillance of the movements of Pawlby .	-3.6006
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story we want to release tomorrow , about which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-5.0817
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures , such as the former Secretary of State David Blunkett .	-5.2547
On Thursday , the brothers heard that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he was himself married to the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who was married at that time .	-6.6416
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have vowed to hack telephones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .	-2.1151
The phone hacking has given way to Mulcaire , Thurbeck and Weatherup .	-6.1135

Skills made it clear : ' The last decisions are made by the members of the municipal council ' .	-6.0075
The flood water unprepared by Gechingen on 15 May 2009 was a tiresome event which raised the question of protection measures for the future , as howls .	-6.1501
A riverbank survey was commissioned with the neighbouring village of Aidlen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-4.4564
" The protection of as many land plots as possible is the aim " , so üßler .	-5.3157
The planning of protection against a German weather service is statistically planned all 100 years of expected flooding .	-5.3985

This is called the HQ 100a climate in specialised circles .	-3.6978
The water masses that had caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year flood .	-7.4798

In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100a climate , approximately EUR 4 million needs to be invested in Gechingen , with the community receiving approximately 70 % of national subsidies . are .	-10.4972
Skiers pointed out , however , that support only exists if a whole concept is implemented .	-5.3956
In this respect , the community must rely on the participation of citizens .	-6.5169
A complex planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.0217
In the best case , the implementation could begin in 2016 .	-1.8967
Among other things , the concept of protection that was presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) envisages local measures in the flow of the Irm liquid from the tribal valley .	-5.1435
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to introduce their concerns .	-2.5287
Among other things , there was a question of why no more dams and reserve basins are planned to protect the place .	-4.5200
Gregor Kühn , the chief engineer of the Caring Forest and Corbe from Hüllsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that the interplay between all the measures proposed is needed to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-14.2358
In addition , one should think of the most economical solution , according to Joachim 's forest of forest and corbe .	-4.6066
There was a displeasure in the case of the location , which has to suffer from overloading the channel network even during normal storm storms .	-7.9968
The problem with administration is well known and first action has been taken .	-5.6724
However , ladies and gentlemen , it was pointed out that the directives on canal systems were different than those for flood control and should not be mixed up .	-6.1606
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two-year or three-year rains could be sued .	-5.7206
Making wastewater channels larger would devour millions .	-2.4769

The police closed the street immediately , but were unable to say anything at the beginning of the accident .	-4.9373
However , there are different testimonies that should be evaluated first .	-2.8937
It is clear that the 19 years old driver of a VW Golf in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came forward with his hyundai .	-5.1416
Both vehicles jumped together , and the woman was so hard trapped that the fire brigades needed just half an hour to get them out of the truck .	-6.2661

Unbound the affinity : its external eyes , the beard , the high forehead .	-5.4370
And just as Fjodor M. Dostojewski is to be understood with his massive oven as a apprentice and apologue of the Russian soul , one reads Philip K. Dick as an American prophet , who is very much in his own country .	-6.8462

Perhaps he was crazy , had given drugs to his brain .	-2.3887
He has broken , early already that the machines are Divinities .	-4.4568

According to the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German internal security service , he should photograph the roof of the US external post , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-5.4701
According to German media , the BVT wanted to prove the presence of surveillance antennas , and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German State Department in Berlin .	-4.3473
James Clapper , the US Director of National Intelligence , insisted in September that the US had no opportunities for foreign espionage to “ steal the secrets of foreign companies to build their international competitiveness or profits . ”	-5.1325
But , since Edward Snowden , who has started to become whistleblower employees , has started to publish his fists to US surveillance , European governments and business leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the Director at his word .	-8.2678
Reports that the US National Security Agency spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and got data from American Cloud suppliers , including Google and Yahoo , have put corporate paranoia at a new peak because of state surveillance .	-5.7421

“ Germany must wake up ” , explains Oliver Green , Chairman of BITMi , who represents small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .	-2.4280
German companies believe that the US now represents almost as much risk as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , a survey published in July by the consultancy company EY .	-3.7122
In the documents sent by Snowden , however , there has been no proof so far that the US has passed on the industrial secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .	-4.6798
Politicians have expressed concern that the EU was meant to miss certain IT and Internet opportunities and to reduce its dependence on the US .	-4.7609

“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacqueyn Johnson , said FoxNews.com.	-3.2210
They would never have believed he died as the shepherd confessed .	-4.7597
“ They believe that there is no logic to oppose the laws of physics as well as common sense , ” says Crump .	-4.3655
Rather , they are convinced that the truth will be lost to protect the person or persons who are responsible for the death of their son .	-3.7957
“ Her son went to school to learn and came back in the corpse , ” he commented .	-3.2618
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , because a number of important issues are still unresolved .	-3.7107
What was the cause of death ?	-0.7376
Is his death a crime ?	-2.1431
Moore declared a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-2.2058
I follow the facts in what direction they take .	-2.3464
My goal is to find out the truth .	-1.2730
“ I believe there is an adequate basis for a formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.6693
Moore explained to reporters who initially suggested that Johnson was dying of the consequences of a “ positioning shooting . ”	-4.8617
But a second autopsy has given rise to another cause of death , so Moore .	-2.9178
“ There are a number of questions that have to be answered or affirmed , ” he said .	-2.0754

CDC Public allergies for schools	-2.8963
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines on how to deal with food allergies from children in schools .	-2.9868
These are the first such directives issued by the US government , as the number of school-school children with food allergies increases .	-3.5200
One in 20 children in the United States now has food allergies .	-2.3663
According to the CDC , food allergies among children grew by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-1.7934
The guidelines include information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies in the curriculum and staff and how to deal with children , which demonstrate allergic reactions .	-5.1054
It is also recommended that schools epinephrin have preached – the autoinjection of the EIR-brand is most commonly used – to cope with a potentially lethal oversensitive reaction .	-6.6808
The federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can use epinephrins to be more easily available .	-5.8324

Parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender untrue . ”	-2.7330
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with non-clear gender .	-4.1356
There is no longer a rigid male or female .	-5.1214
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare a sex for such children , but can “ vote ” or “ not set ” on birth certificate .	-4.9990
The aim of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions in operations for sexual intercourse for newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-5.5438
An intersexual person said , according to BBC years later : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.3633
I maintain the patchwork that was created by doctors , muted and full of scars . and are . are and . are , , and , , , ,	-7.3718
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year is neither a boy nor a girl .	-3.5520
They are among the intersexual , a group that comes under the diagnosis of “ sexual differential disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collection concept for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( eggs or hoses ) or unusually developed genitals .	-9.9695
Wallis Simpson was perhaps intersexual .	-2.4241
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US suggest that one should use the best available information on gender assignment if no provision is possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding , if any , for an operation .	-5.8554
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said that the new German law “ rings to a good cause . ”	-4.6445
Intersex children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.7095
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery , but that is not true for most children , ” he said .	-3.2665
You can do a sexual instruction without surgery and then wait for your identity developer .	-4.7889
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity is not very accurate .	-2.9745
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.7214
It is like a secret , which is why people are homosexual .	-4.9903
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersex people are different from transsexual or transgenders , because their status is not gender but because of their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically defines both at the same time or not clearly as one of them .	-5.5083
These characteristics were in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , body , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosome structures and hormones .	-5.3940
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgenders in work , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-5.3852
Young people who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp .	-3.3854
Meanwhile , in Australia and Nepal , it is possible for adults to refer to official documents of male , female , or “ third gender . ”	-3.6489
In June , Australians Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was acknowledged as the world ’ s first “ gender ” person after a court provided the preservation of “ not defined ” sexual status .	-6.5312
In the future , Deutsche Ausstellung have a third assignment , X for intersexual , so the Interior Department .	-5.1954
In neighbouring France , sexual issues are still controversial , such as a news release on France 24 .	-3.9569
In 2011 , tens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from schoolbooks .	-2.6931
The US Cathholoc Online website has also opposed the German law , saying : “ If the world is dragged into a new state , where gender is a decision , sexual activity , but not , then we rotate two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-5.6176
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared a baby zone , she would find it better if babies were allocated a sex at birth .	-4.6665
“ The parent ’ s face is already stressful enough even without further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your own child , ” she said the parent website .	-5.1468
Children need stability and security .	-0.5924
Historically , children born with both male and female intercourse were referred to as hermaphrates returns , according to the attractive Greek God that had both sexes .	-5.5875
Ten years ago , the medicine viewed gender as something that could be deleted and then rebuilt .	-4.2255
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , after it is known how complex gender identity is , and doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when he grows with the sex they have allocated .	-6.9617
“ In the middle of the twentieth century , one called it a “ psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-3.6666
When such a child was born , they called not the psychiatrist but the surgeon .	-2.5925
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with non-clear gender reverts to Dr John Money from Johns Hopkins University , who argued that gender is transformable .	-5.1136
He coined the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental impediments – as parents train a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , hoping to see a person as male or female .	-5.9191
But , in a case known as “ John / Joan ” in 1966 , his theories were controversial .	-2.9375
He cries the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off in a covert circumcision , watch the child completely , and also remove his pants and then take him as a girl .	-7.2992
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation that he was not . ”	-3.0344
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to male sex and married a woman .	-1.9764
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-1.7259
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.8159
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the Internet , these sexual operations have become public , “ not happy with the result . ”	-5.3705
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36 year old author from Montana , born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous gender .	-3.7154
Doctors were not clear about whether he had a large client or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man .	-4.5166
So his external body and the pants were removed short after the birth of 1976 surgical and he was taken up as a girl .	-5.1466
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-2.0179
“ I knew I ’ m not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com .	-2.2978
I was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.5866
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal load .	-2.3604
But , because he was depressive , and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical acts .	-4.2496
What he found out was shocking .	-1.3029
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one ever told me that .	-2.6472
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterones to develop genitals .	-3.5304
After experiencing the truth , he moved back to male identity , obtained testosterone injections , and was able to remove his brothers .	-5.9254
The surgery has made it infertile .	-2.0864
Today , he is fighting for others within an organization called Interface Project for the normal practice of inter.	-4.1382
But Anne Tamar Mattis , the managing director of Advocates , based in California , for Informed Choice , takes care that the German law can “ encourage stamps and stigmatize . ”	-6.4187
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to take quick decisions and to admit to the child , not to be established , ” she explained .	-6.0911
We are afraid of favourable interventions .	-2.4809
We think it would be better to send the male or female gender to wait .	-3.2432
We still do not know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.1883
Tamar Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law , for “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third gender . ”	-4.4705
“ adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.5332
The German law is about giving birth to a .	-3.1428
This is not a fight to force small children at this time .	-3.6200
If they grow up , they can decide for themselves about their bodies .	-3.1066
But Dr. Arlene Barrow , a Pittsburg chest radiologist , who has a daughter with a sexual differential disorder , and who supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ soulful ” both parents and children .	-6.4091
Katie , the daughter of Barbate , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgen-resistant .	-3.2766
Katie has developed female characteristics due to the reception defect of the target cells for testosterone .	-4.7773
It has a vagina , but no Uterus and no egg .	-2.5661
Today she is Katie 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a member of the childhood psychiatrist .	-4.6824
Although it is infertile , it hopes to get a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-3.1759
“ The law gives parents space , which doesn ’ t have to make decisions too hastily , ” said Barrow .	-5.8912
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things , and so gives them time to write “ male ” or “ female ” .	-4.3891
That way , everything is fine – you draw the child large and loves it .	-3.8846
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent 's luck .	-4.1694
And there is no need to hasten an operation that can no longer be reversed .	-4.2516
“ This includes children in the decision , and removes the fear that parents are being killed because they think they don ’ t do the right thing , ” she explained .	-5.2473
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that suits him better – and that is all wonderful .	-4.7545
This will enable children to decide for themselves .	-2.4891
Unknew girls hurt by shot from cars	-4.1560
Unknew were injured in a twelve-year in Sachsen-Anhalt when wearing a car .	-5.7119
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin with an air pressure force .	-2.8727

The girl was easily injured on the left side of the car .	-4.3940
Surveillance forces brought the girl to hospital .	-3.3225
The shot came from a small car that had gone by to a group of six children and had suddenly stopped .	-3.7965
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.1421
The perpetrators also shot at a bus stop .	-2.6428

Then they went away .	-2.5826
The criminals flag was found on Friday .	-3.7295
Until now , the police inspectorate of Kempten can look back at a quiet night of Halloween .	-4.5157
The officials were called just two to catch up children who were waiting for them against house façades .	-5.8587
Because house owners realized this in time and removed the eggs in the same way , no material damage would have arisen .	-5.3427
In addition , some people in the city were merciled by Sylvester oils , but no material damage was caused .	-9.9579
A native of the bishopric Friend Path reported that his cars were covered with cloned paper and that his bike hide .	-8.1229

In fact , Walkled Ries loves to lie .	-4.9817
The house is situated in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old building , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-4.2982
It is only a few minutes by public transport to the city . , and . , , , , , , ,	-3.8093
" I hope you have no fear of spiders ? " , Walkled Ries asks and shows on a fat spider at the door .	-5.1548
I have been searching for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.0459
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.6656
The reason is not a spinnephobia , but the concern that at the age the many stairs to the house and in the apartment can no longer be overcome , explains it .	-6.2799
In addition , since a menismus operation , the adjudication has to know on its own body what it means to move on the floor with a handicap .	-7.6789
Just recently a book of her appeared on the theme of " lucky living in old age - What kind of housing is the best for me ? '	-8.3932
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not happen at all at the age ' , begins telling .	-5.6078
When she moved to Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , she was simply a beautiful flat in the middle of the green .	-4.4131
Today , with a half-century , Walcht Ries thinks otherwise .	-4.9889
She also knows that she is one of the few people dealing with the theme of ' living at age ' .	-5.4611
Most of these things go wrong as long as they occur .	-5.1232
Alt are always only the other ' , says it dirty .	-4.7040
It is only when the pressure of suffering is really great that one is concerned .	-4.9342
'Then it may be too late ' , so giant .	-3.5401
In their book interior designers presented 17 living models for a self-defined living age .	-4.3162
'What type of housing you choose is always an individual ' , explains it .	-4.9716
D i e solution do not exist for age .	-1.8342
Even those who can afford an old age sleep in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that he could also be ill .	-4.4351
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the national language , you can join in the Dolce Vita , ' you will be able to consider the specialist book holders in disobedience .	-9.0350
These models include classic care models , alternative types of housing , or the often cited pensioners ' WG .	-6.0648
At the Old Age everyone has so much their ticks and Macken .	-4.6248
'For me it would be a community but nothing ' , she says it with a eyekeeper .	-5.6427
Not even like a student WG with a common bath and kitchen .	-2.9531
'At old you just need its retractions ' , so Ries .	-4.8261
However , the bookwriters do not want to rule out the fact that a family of senior citizens can still function .	-6.0421
But that should be different from the classic student WG .	-4.4957
And sometimes you just want his peace , " she thinks .	-3.6987
It is not alone in the national capital .	-5.1587
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for so long , " is also the experience of Teresa Rütten , the leader of civil services at the age of the national capital .	-5.8022
Your office advises people around the matter of becoming old .	-3.6778
That is why older people would often be taking into account the inconvenience and restrictions , just to stay in their familiar environment , and that is also the experience of the Foundation for Trade Test .	-7.8857
There are now many ways of making the house or apartment accessible to the public .	-5.0076
A giant waiter for all those who are concerned with the ageing of their home or their apartment , advise on the need for thorough information and not to instruct the best craftsmen .	-10.1049
Today there are also specialists for age-oriented reconstruction .	-4.6636
Even in the rental apartment one or more is carried out , and if it is only the increase in the toilets , interior designers will be informed .	-6.6124
But it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment into an age fair and thus barrier-free , even if it is still so beautiful .	-5.5012
This experience had to make Walcht Ries .	-3.6276
Although we could install a stairway inside the apartment , which would be paved with stairways to the front of the apartment , it would be far more obstruction .	-8.0988
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for her and her husband .	-2.7444
Before moving , it is more grey than before the spider in their home door .	-4.4188
The US wants Snowden to pursue further prosecutions	-4.1354
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.1584
He continues to be accused of having passed secret information without permission .	-4.6657
So he had to face criminal proceedings in the United States , said the Speaker of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-4.6796
Even recent statements by Snowden would not change this .	-3.4274
Before that , German Green politicians , Hans-Christian Sträufer , had appealed to the US not to threaten him further with punishment after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow .	-5.4759
Psaki emphasized that current statements are the words of a parliamentarian , not of a German member of the government .	-5.6310
Secretary of State Unknown Edward Snowden is basically willing to talk to the German authorities .	-5.4899
But first he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.1298
The former NSA staff , called by the United States , made this clear in an unaddressed letter that led Green politicians Hans-Christian Sträufer on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the German Federal Chancellor .	-8.5674
The letter has the following wording :	-3.2236
Exchanges	-1.8555
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry into mass surveillance .	-2.7996
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden , who was previously a contract or a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) , and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-4.8542
In the course of my employment in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of the law of my government , which led me to be a moral duty to act .	-4.7194
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw a serious and persistent hearing forced me to leave my family and my home .	-3.9426
I live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.5436
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.0635
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations into a system of comprehensive surveillance that is accountable to no one as a service to the public .	-4.7827
These spy revelations attracted many proposals on new laws and policies that were based on the previously hidden misuse of public trust .	-5.5336
The benefits to society from these gains are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks involved have been visibly reduced .	-3.8163
Although the result of my efforts has been shown to be positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a sign of loyalty and seeks to criminalise and indict political expression .	-5.4043
Nevertheless , the truth is not a crime .	-1.4712
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this back attitude .	-3.8043
I hope that when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to take part in the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports , in accordance with the law .	-5.5789
I look forward to having a meeting with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that is protected by all of us .	-5.1966

" The community is satisfied , " says Maier .	-2.2864

Report : Obama-ampagne considered replacing Biden by Hillary Clinton	-2.6009
President Barack Obama ’ s closest adviser , in secret , thought that he would replace Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 election campaign , the New York Times .	-4.7639
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin ’ s long-awaited work , and John Heilemann ’ s 2012 electoral campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-4.5235
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and she reported on Thursday night that the president ’ s top advisers had “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s staggering hope of re-election would be better off if he dropped Biden .	-6.7556
According to Jonathan Martin , the newspaper ’ s national correspondent , the book closely draws the story of the efforts of leading officials in the campaign and the White House , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect on poll numbers to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-Presidents .	-7.4661
The potential change was a strong secret in the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.8034
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , the former campaign leader Obama , Jim Messina , and the White House ’ s former chief adviser , David Axel and David Plafufe – knew about the proposed change .	-4.3924
In “ Double Down ” , it is said that Daley was at the forefront of the effort to exchange Biden , despite its “ close , personal relationship , ” before the decision was finally taken against such a move , after the data showed that Obama ’ s candidacy “ does not significantly improve Obama ’ s opportunities . ”	-7.3738
In an interview with Martin Daley , the government has indeed considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.1670
" I mentioned a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , " Daley declared the magazine .	-3.2566
We must remember that the president had terrible demeanons at the time , so we thought , “ To God ’ s Will , what do we do ? ”	-4.2822
While Daley described the studies as “ deliverable care , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort was made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a train pays for the ballot box .	-5.7047
“ In campaigns , not spending so much money on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t seriously think about something , ” said Martin on AC360 .	-4.7273
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team had thought about exchange .	-2.3014
He said to CNN , he asked Daley if his boss knew what might change .	-3.6456
Although Daley said he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew .	-3.6161
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political probes had reached a desk .	-4.0626
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thinks Obama knew nothing about whether to leave Biden in the elections .	-3.9951
“ Perhaps ” , Martin replied .	-2.2097
What happens to my e-mail ?	-1.4963
E-mails actually mean electronic letter .	-3.2226
Did the confidentiality of letters be implemented in the design of the Internet service e-mail in the same way as in conventional mail ?	-5.6130
The concept of the early Internet services focused on making communication possible .	-3.6091
For this reason , the basic technical protocols were not considered to create a stable basis for a correspondence safe .	-6.0865
Thus , conventional mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.9636
If you send a mail to " Anna " to " Benni " , are the machines of the two directly connected ?	-3.3633
The email program or browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step .	-3.7991
If , for example , it has a GM account , the Google would be .	-3.5731
This mail server sends the contents to the provider that Benni uses .	-2.5011
The track can run the mail over a number of other servers on the internet .	-4.8443
Bennie can call the content with his provider .	-2.3916
Have conventional emails read through the network ?	-4.2824
Most emails are read by software robots on the way .	-2.7486
The sender 's provider typically checks whether the mail performs a malicious program as an attachment .	-5.0598
A virus check is also made on the recipient systems .	-2.7257
In addition , the providers check whether it is a bad and unwanted spam mail , which is immediately deleted or sorted out in a spam folder .	-5.6833
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.7853
For systems like GMMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.4914
When Anna and Benni interact with their upcoming holiday trips , Google may link to holiday offers .	-4.9564
Are there any people who do not subscribe to e-mails ?	-5.8602
The probability of unsuspecting people reading a mail is extremely low .	-3.7211
But this is possible in theory .	-4.2162
In companies , administrators often have the option of reading electronic mail .	-2.9060
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or accepting e-mails .	-3.7876
This will include possible illegal extinction .	-4.1681
Is it possible to protect email against reading ?	-2.1906
Encryption using the OpenPGP standard allows an email to be encrypted effectively against participation .	-4.4355
With a high technical effort , it is also possible to disguise metadata of an email communication , so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom .	-5.4220
How important are Yahoo and Google on the mail market in Germany ?	-1.7633
Yahoo and Google , according to a survey of Convios Consulting from August 2013 , play only a minor role in the mailboxes .	-4.6502
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had recently fallen , GMMail could add significantly to Google .	-3.7774
Giving Mother in Forest and Remaining pensions	-5.1286
When his betted mother died , a man from Wolfsburg would forge a plan .	-3.4749
He committed the deaths in a forest - and continues to collect their pension and carers .	-3.8549
In order to continue to collect pension and care money , a 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother after investigation by the police in the forest .	-5.1165
First , he squandered the death of the 89-year-old , then he cleared the money for more than a year and a half .	-4.3439
Now the 67-year-olds have to answer for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-3.3937
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.1908
The man was suspected earlier in May : Back then , it seemed that no more drugs were needed for the needy mother .	-5.2426
Pensioners told the pensioners that their mother travelled to Spain .	-2.1432
Because the official had made this strange , they did check .	-4.8662
It was realised that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had last maintained it .	-4.7214
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-1.6624
According to police evidence there was no evidence of a crime of capital .	-3.9540
Are you looking for ice cream lit in the dark ?	-1.8814
A British entrepreneur has developed the first glimmer of ice in the dark – with pain .	-4.2111
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent properties of marine animals and created a shining leak in them .	-5.1071
The idea came to him after having read a research on qualifications and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein .	-5.1034
The ice cream reacts when consumption with the tongue , increasing the pH value of the protein and causing the luminaire .	-3.6171
Chris explains that his ice reacted to the warmth of the mouth and lit – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-5.2201
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company " Lick Me I 'm Delicious " , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-4.2482
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-1.5458
When the mouth warm the protein , the pH value and the ice shines .	-2.8904
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed to us ideal to put it on Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-4.9803
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the quality pollution is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.3320
Each bullet costs me about <unk> 140 .	-4.7238
But it tastes delicious .	-2.1520
The hostel is located in the heart of Bristol .	-6.7102
But his latest creation is to be even more ambitious .	-2.2382
He said : “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.3633
This is impossible in itself because of the fragility of the ice crystals from which the ice cream is made ; but I suspect that we can create it .	-6.1741
The ice cream uses the fluorescence qualities of a quality manufactured by Chinese scientists .	-4.0965
TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six games days .	-4.7040
Starting out now , the team of Ingo Ehler will be appointed tomorrow for the Derby against TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-5.5120
With this game the season starts new for us .	-2.0395
" I hope that we will finally have our head free , " Ehler will behave optimistically .	-5.0450
At last , with the exception of the permanently wounded Hendrik Blohme , he has at his disposal a complete Kader .	-5.5077
Daverden also uses template game .	-4.5190
We therefore need to keep our error rate low .	-2.7297
However , the most important thing is to increase the coverage , which has left everything but a safe impression .	-5.8627
Daverden Coach Thomas Panitz is significantly more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-4.7565
The game was of course a house number .	-1.4597
But for this reason we are not the favourite , because everything can happen in the Derby .	-4.3355
However , Panitz will now post in Morsum to start a series .	-3.7409
There is no Jan-Malite Jodat .	-4.2027
For this , the A-Jung Joost Windf is celebrating his seasonal debut , which is active in the A-Jugend-Region HC Bremen with dual player rights .	-8.5553
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.6453
Halloween 2013 : In numbers	-1.5483
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.7594
My sister and I were permitted to eat sweets , late stay and to hurt us for the neighborhood .	-3.8683
Today I became more like a Halloween forum .	-3.1943
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute from my home of candy , and I think I will not do so this year either .	-8.0981
According to statistics , however , I am a black sheep with regard to Halloween .	-3.0970
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , with a total of $ 6.9 billion for sweets , costumes and decorations , such as the US Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-5.3632
One thing that I look forward to is the trend values of every Halloween .	-3.8000
The costumes will account for about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , the NRF .	-3.0572
This year 's exciting untreated items are the last shrine .	-4.5917
Women no longer have to hide in sex clothes , they can now also embody seductive food such as pizza , Hamburg or Karotten .	-4.4664
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft-punk-Space änner will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-4.9584
According to Google , the most popular costumes are Zombies , Batman , Pirates , and Heat .	-3.7346
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.6227
Last year we dressed up our dogs and were not alone in my surprise .	-2.8811
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for their pets , that is the NRF .	-3.0770
They are a lot of “ hot dog ” .	-2.9404
When it comes to candy , we are not shy . and are . , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.3446
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-2.1229
This is about 270 million kilograms of Schokorklin , luchers , bons and rubber balls .	-4.9492
So good news for the US Department of Commerce , according to the US Department of Commerce , who drag 41 million people through the quarter with the phrase “ sweetness or sauces . ”	-5.9952
In fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let ’ s not mind – eat .	-3.0396
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn , yet 15 million kilograms of it is sold by Halloween , according to the National Association of Sweet Manufacturers .	-4.3882
That is about nine billion maize grains .	-2.4310
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to resolve .	-2.5088
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it sways .	-3.6902
They have great names such as “ Terror d the Walls ” ( which incidentally is in a real prison ) , “ How-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-4.9065
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognized spot houses in the United States , which are $ 500 million , such as America heats , and this includes the wonderful photos on which you are entering your pants , and then on Facebook , where you will not get rid of them , and then one of the type on which you have to leave a comment as “ net face pressure . ”	-11.0884
But finally we come to the pumpkin .	-3.2162
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Kürbis when we were children , and the snapping of a pumpkin is like the snail of the Christmas tree – something that we made from small to small .	-6.0996
Fortunately , the “ baby in the gush ” trend started only last year thanks to its Pinochet , so that most of us have grown up with cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-7.0751
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpbisse , the US Census Bureau .	-2.4152
The pumpbisquene that slowly rotates in the pre-garden is probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin was harvested this year .	-4.9744
If you want to point correctly , call Tim and Susan Mathison in Napa , California and wander some lobstones from their 921 kilos of heavy pumps .	-6.9389
Living fire in Helm Law : rescuing forces killed corps	-6.2211
The fire brigade had to be removed on Thursday night in Helm 's right .	-6.4949

The rescue forces have a stolen body from the house .	-2.4892
Help forces have found a stolen body in a three-family house on a fire in the form of a fire in Helmsb.	-5.2103
It is unclear whether it is a resident , as a spokesperson for the police in Bayreuth said .	-4.1861
In the late afternoon it had been burnt on the ground floor of the house .	-3.6144
When the fire brigade hit , the flames beat out of a window .	-3.1824
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.3696
There was no tea / coffee making facilities in the room . did , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.3106
The entire ground floor has been damaged .	-2.2149
All other residents were not home during the fire , the police spokesperson continued to explain .	-4.1170
For the time being , the building could not be habitable .	-6.4603
The precise cause of the fire was not clear at first .	-3.6198
Germany 's largest church has launched a offensive to promote the pastor profession .	-3.7703
The region ’ s Evangelic Church of Hannover assumes that the number of currently around 1,800 pastors and pastors will be halved according to current location by 2030 .	-6.9407
For young people of today the profession is very attractive and offer a good future , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the evangelical press service .	-4.1660
It is attractive to determine the workflow of your own business .	-4.2033
The Church of the State has appointed an Pastor in a dedicated position to inspire young people for the theoretical studies .	-7.9434
At present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology .	-3.4215
Burfian returned this to the process of unecclesification : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-4.2493
It is the profession of great freedom and diversity .	-2.7410
I am Mr Calender and I can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.2830
Pastors could be very close to people as a caretaker .	-4.1481
They did as much as teachers and could well live of them .	-3.5439
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but for that , theologians would have a secure employer .	-3.1391
This is coming up against the young people of today , who are not just about a career , but rather an enlightened job .	-6.1990
According to the church , which covers three quarters of rainfall , around 60 pastors are currently in retirement per year .	-5.0274
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology school start their Vikarat .	-3.0790
In sparsely populated areas such as the Harz , the Emsland , or the Wendland , it can be hard to occupy positions in future .	-6.4427
Burfien , among other things , is organizing for young people and inviting celebrities who have studied theology .	-5.5877
The school of literature offered a broad education .	-4.7980
It is even possible to become a federal president .	-3.5571
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.2429
In addition , you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a voice system .	-4.6903
The options range from enhanced brakes , a service package with assistance from Bowler Works Mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-4.7942
Drew Bowler , CEO of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.0260
They are not all experienced racers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an reachable way to world class events .	-5.0634
We are pleased to be able to open this way into partnership with Land Rover and MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the various rally disciplines in Great Britain and abroad and to prepare novices for the streets and the reality of Rally Raid .	-6.3305
We really had fun developing the defensive of Challenge cars – this will be an entertaining mastership .	-5.3999
The Defense Challenge also has a training and test day in February , as well as an option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.7889
Fire brigade to rescue a waistcoat set 15 meters above the ground in a dangerous rock jump in . the of , and , , , , ,	-7.1890
Cockkers Vegerine Ruby had gone away after a small traffic accident .	-6.4206
Three days later , she was discovered by a pedestrian walker in the rock crash in her unfortunate situation .	-4.0313
Fire fighters settled down on rock walls and saved the dog before the certain death .	-5.7887
The fire brigade was able to bring a shrine in safety , which was fixed on a rock wall at a height of 15 meters .	-7.2075
The nine months old dashboard bitch Ruby had gone away on Sunday afternoon after a traffic accident and survived three days alone before it was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.9368
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becy Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flampoint in Denholme , West Yorkshire to return to Ruby and to thank the fire-fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-5.7206
They had desperately wanted to look for their missing lodgers and made cries for help in social networks when they had escaped to the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-7.3289
About 14 : 15 am on Wednesday , a pedestrian walker who carried his dog , the hanged Ruby on the 15 meter high paragraph in the quarry . the were and were not .	-8.6105
The Cleckheaton Fire station 's technical rescue team ran out of service to rescue Rubys , who were transported up in a dog box .	-7.7164
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.3807
It was situated in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the floor .	-3.6059
They did not move any muscle during their rescue – they were as stiff as they were .	-2.8840
But now it is doing it well .	-2.2644
She then took a dog cake .	-4.4747
This was a fairly unusual exercise .	-2.3351
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.8801
Peter Lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge fortune . ”	-2.2218
It was possible that she was very difficult to hurt or worse .	-3.0185
Ruby was sent to the veterinarian for investigation , but nothing happened except exhaustion and dehydration .	-5.2399
As she said , she said , “ When the rescue occurred , it was scary . ”	-6.1594
I could not believe that it really was there .	-2.8140
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor .	-1.4767
The veterinary explained that if exhaustion had become too large and had collapsed , it would probably have sunk .	-4.8179
Fire fighters have done a great job .	-4.0432
It was really brave enough to do what they did .	-2.5771
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-3.0186
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that it would fall down , but it remained up . ”	-3.3987
The fire fighters were great .	-1.1977
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.1977
Mick Jagger explained that he never made a copy of Kathy Perry when she was 18 .	-3.4033
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop-start said that she worked as a backrock singer on Jaggers Song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-5.8928
He explained that she had dined with the Altroger to evening , and that “ he had asked me to be 18 . ”	-7.8941
She added : “ That was long ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.8036
In a statement , a representative , Jagger , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he has ever made any attempts to approach Katy Perry . ”	-4.8360
The representative added : “ It may have confused him with someone else . ”	-3.7132

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the election	-1.9402
A new day , a new history of terror for independence .	-1.5285
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-1.8430
This provides the keyword for stories about Passion Control in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hagerswall .	-6.4182
In fact , the Strathclyde proposal referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but this played no role – expected – in the headlines .	-5.6200
Nor did anyone mention that EU member states often rule their strict rules when it is more convenient for them .	-4.1058
As Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area , continuing indifference to Brussels would be only a small concession in return for what one really wants from the Scots .	-5.0855
So not a story .	-1.9120
And one that has come so in the years that it is already like a fossil : the first time I have heard the “ independence means passport controls ” coming at least 40 years ago .	-5.3933
An interesting point is lost in the continuous rerecording of this ancient history .	-4.8377
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European pillar ?	-2.3372
Why exchange the London yoke with Brussels , especially now ?	-3.4124
That is the real European news : the big plan for the unification of Europe that was launched after the war has stalled .	-4.1953
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-2.7260
Parties everywhere in the EU are gaining ground that is hostile to the EU or who want to throw the euro over board as a common currency .	-3.3282
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Alternative for Germany – which was founded only this year – was able to win almost five million votes at the federal election in September , effectively pushing Free Democrats ( equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-5.9576
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-2.0951
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-1.7398
Because of the stringent austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket in which the respective national economy is obliged by maintaining a common currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.5793
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive fiscal deficits – that was only the case in Greece .	-2.4871
Instead , the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to do so .	-3.6736
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe is finding its own productive disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany .	-4.3242
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-1.5922
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems is a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.4560
As a result of the ‘ green ’ energy guidelines ordered by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays the double for electricity compared with the United States and four times for gas .	-4.1162
This is a paralyzing cost reduction as we have already seen in Graniouth .	-4.3112
All world wage-earners do not protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap US shale gas .	-3.8087
As a result , revolution pulls out , especially in France , the EU ’ s former Cherishers .	-5.7113
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on a par with Washington .	-3.3760
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe to its own economic policy , fighting the struggling French economy .	-4.3830
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , thus denying the ruling Socialists three .	-4.1101
The Front National is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a split in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-8.2364
What does Le Pen , with her newly won popularity among white French , make the working class ?	-3.7391
It would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament .	-3.0080
If anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.4090
That is the point I would like to make : in the not-too-distant future , the growing portfolio against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-4.6366
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” favored by General de Gaulle .	-2.4983
Germany and some of its satellite economies may be holding up on the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-3.3692
I expect the UK to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself with the United States .	-3.2809
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in Atlantic rain .	-2.5142
Where does Scotland stick with all this ?	-2.9662
We can choose to be a region of ( the last consequence ) small England .	-2.9677
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including to say to Berlin and Brussels what they can be .	-4.1523
I suspect that Scotland could go well in a relaxed European association if we keep our own currency .	-4.6091
Cooperation with other , similarly minded countries is easier in a not-federal Europe of nations .	-3.3130
Otherwise , we should consider doing the same with Norway and keeping our economic independence .	-2.6140
The SNP government in Scotland , to be remarkable , is the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 due to the rejection of the proposed ( and imagined ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Democracy coalition had to answer .	-5.9708
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide for independence now only to be forced on austerity by Berlin and Brussels .	-3.8012
Early Puberness : Will Grow Up Up Up	-6.4191
Afro-American and hiSpanish girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age sensations , as expats show .	-4.7949
Physical changes do not mean immediately the puberty . the of and are and .	-8.4808
There is no proof that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.6217
Experts believe that the epidemiic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .	-3.4883
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced in boys	-2.3019
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specialising in child health and family issues .	-2.8382
Should a mother be worried when their daughter grows up in the age of seven or eight years breasts and shamabare ?	-4.2553
At the annual conference of the Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowwitz explained that this early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-4.6295
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually that there is no sign that they are now quickly putting their puberty , ” said Kaplowice .	-7.0137
An obvious display of development , such as growing breasts , sham and Achselhaare , as well as a body hose , show up earlier with girls .	-7.2860
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarch ( appearance of the initial blood circulation ) in the last 40 years .	-5.3139
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-4.4160
“ If the development of the Brotherhood begins , it takes at least two to three years to the Menarchy , ” said Kaplowice , also author of the book “ Early Puberty in girls : The essential advice to deal with this often occurring problem . ”	-7.1647
Time is the most accurate test of how the puberty advances .	-2.9691
It is a matter of dispute , which is indeed the beginning of puberty , but it is the case that the breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-7.1615
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can monitor closely .	-2.8526
When faster progress is made , tests may be shown by endologists to eliminate serious problems such as tumors or cysts .	-5.9958
There are treatments that slow down early menstruation and defense from another consequence : the premature aging of bones , the ultimate to growth inhibitions , and thus small body growth in adults .	-7.1125
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are directed at the age of the child , the development speed , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .	-4.0087
Psycho-social aspects are also important .	-1.5721
Kaplowice is reserved for medicines , but it admits that “ the oppressing of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and feelings of girls to be different from their age sense . ”	-6.0323
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.6291
“ They worry about abortion risk or about how to treat hygienic sites , ” said Kaplowice .	-4.9861
“ It was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter received ten her days .	-3.0291
Although there were initial signs and we spoke about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-3.2049
She came scared and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friend 's circle .	-3.4715
There are many widely used theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.2516
But there is no coherent proof that hormones are primordial in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media .	-4.3969
Young , like girls , come into puberty earlier .	-4.2622
Kaplowice believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic .	-2.6716
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine who create a connection between body fat and entry into puberty .	-3.9973
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-1.9048
In that country , Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to move beyond their white age prospects .	-4.3813
There are different explanations for this .	-1.3356
Global seems to be early puberty of all kinds of things , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .	-3.7201
Another puzzling : Although boys already grow the face and feel of earlier , the trend toward full-scale former puberty is not as strong as girls .	-6.3989
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-1.9233
The appearance of acne and shama is spread even among babies and young children .	-3.1707
“ We need to be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endoconologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.7444
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician how to talk to their child .	-3.1251
“ This can mean that you have to hold a conversation earlier than expected , ” says Kaplowice .	-5.3818
If you remain calm , the child normally reacts well .	-3.5397
Girls who flourish early need insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if they are conceived earlier .	-3.7565
Jumbo vendors argue in the face of large orders over seating width .	-2.5334
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a discussion on the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , which explains the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.3616
The dispute revolves around the seat width that passengers are offered on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most striving for the airlines , but this area is the key to the efficiency claims of Airbus SAS and Boeing ’ s newest .	-7.9288
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that airlines should decide .	-5.2113
The controversy comes at a time when aircraft builders are competing to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul airplanes , and expect record contracts for the event from November 17th to 21st .	-5.9362
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – particularly if there are nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the given economic results that the new Mini Jumbo is to provide .	-5.9077
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” comprises 406 people in a tourist class that is over 17 inches wide and allows ten per row .	-7.0959
Airbus explains the competing version of the A350 carrier 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-4.8522
Planetgiants often divide hiebe through technical details by advertising in the trade press .	-4.5705
Now Airbus is calling to the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X with more than 100 orders will likely make the race directly to the public .	-4.9207
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war and showed a picture of donors sitting together with three people in a restaurant , entitled : “ Would you accept it ? ”	-6.8852
“ Boeing proposes long-range flights in seats that are more close than regional turboprops , ” says Airbus distributor John Leahy .	-4.2407
People are becoming thicker when changing food habits , but aircraft seats have not changed .	-4.0779
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-range journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average American aged between 40 and 49 years has increased by 10 % , according to the US Department of Health .	-5.1633
According to US health statistics , the size of the male average American in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm .	-3.1477
Airbus is saying that its rival is in the 1950s when the average body coverage of the newly named Jet Set was narrowed .	-6.8429
According to Airbus , research carried out showed that an additional inch ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 percent .	-4.6889
Boeing 's figures are on the size of seats and say that it is not the manufacturer 's discretion to decide how airlines make the balance between airline prices and service .	-6.5002
The company also explains , according to studies , that the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .	-5.0970
“ It is really about giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to succeed , ” says the airline expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-4.9993
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.4607
They know their business better than any other .	-2.3644
Passengers are concerned with greater freedom of ivory , but the issue for manufacturers is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-6.0437
Behind the argument is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-5.2342
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets .	-2.9991
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-haul designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seater Boeing 777-300ER .	-3.7822
The statements made in relation to the results are partly related to the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-5.0912
An increase in unit costs is still less than ten seats per row currently used .	-3.6544
“ That ’ s why Boeing is placing more seats on its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-4.9290
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per row at existing 77777s , indicated that many passengers decided on a closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-5.6978
“ Achtzehen customs seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus supply is controlled by the 777 threat , ” said Mary Kirby , an expert for cabin installation , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-10.9203
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select .	-2.6140
The world ’ s jet salesmen even bear weight behind their belt to measure the equipment in the competition .	-7.3530
Even if they price the comfort , all manufacturers also offer chips with high density arrangement for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.8986
Airbus has a ten-seat A350 , but has not yet sold on its own .	-5.1797
Until recently , Airbus has stressed the importance of adapting its cabins and providing wide board seats for some jets .	-5.9924
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to be fuelled , but could be deflected from the wave of 777X sales .	-6.1320
Neuer Anti-Nikotin vaccine might make the pleasure of smoking the garner .	-8.8090
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could cook smoking fun .	-3.2427
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice for life from nicotine addiction .	-2.4805
Before human tests , further attempts are needed , which may take some years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-5.3677
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than those approaches , ” Cornell says .	-4.5667
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been changed to include genetic information for the manufacture of nicotine antibodies .	-3.6816
The virus communicates selectively the liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-2.4616
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before reaching the brain , so that a smoker does not get nicotine-high .	-4.9367
In attempts , the hardened mice that Nikotin was given , increases their normal level of activity .	-6.4839
In a negative way , without vaccination , the researchers explained that the nicotine had reached their brain .	-6.8825
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-1.9032
Previous tobacco imprints did not because they contained antibodies .	-2.7493
Vaccines had to be given so often to maintain the antibody base that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.6613
But the costs of the new vaccine are probably considerably lower , because it turns liver cells into antibody factories .	-3.8063
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is safe , could be administered to children before they succumb to temptation to try a cigarette , and thus avoid nicotine .	-5.3433
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-1.8150
" You then know that when they start to smoke again , they no longer feel fun because of the nicotine pulse , and that helps them to lay the habit , " he explains .	-6.7392
British scientists said that the results are interesting , but at the same time warned that further research is needed .	-2.4057
Triodi deny to have been influenced by Obeid .	-2.3605
The former Secretary of the Labors-Party Joe Triodi from New South Wales will initiate an investigation by state corruption authorities .	-5.0511
The former NSW minister denies that the rules on puppet leave have changed the Obeid to request from his political mentor , Eddie , who had hidden holdings in three plots of state-controlled land .	-7.5267
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into the question of whether Obeid had influenced different ministers of state in terms of extending the lease contracts at the Circum Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café , without calling for their replacement in August 2005 .	-8.8166
Now , due to the accusation , Triodi has been identified by Obeids 's hidden interest in the property , after Triodis 's former deputy chief , Lynne Ashpole , had issued on Thursday .	-7.7900
In years of discussions that started in 2005 , the government had pressed for public tender contracts .	-3.6956
The couples were against this and also wished for longer periods of time .	-4.7123
In 2009 , the lease contracts for the Circum Quay companies , which donated $ 2.5 million to the Obeids every year , were extended without public tender .	-6.1365
Triodi , who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , initially spoke in favour of public tenders .	-4.1161
But he contended to make the changes to Obeid ’ s requests , which , as Triodi confirmed , had pressed for a government reform of its lease arrangements .	-6.4529
One of the ICAC 's telephone records showed talks between Obeid , Triodi and Steve Dunn in August and September 2007 , a senior official who changed to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries .	-5.6267
“ Whereas the issue discussed in these phone calls was the preparation of the commercial procurement rules ? ” , the deputy Commissioner , Anthony Whey Triodi , asked .	-6.0928
“ No ” replied Triodi .	-1.7850
I do not remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-2.6623
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.6237
Israeli combat aircraft attack targets in Syria , as official sources .	-3.1646
Israeli hunting aircraft had attacked Thursday eight of a destination in the Syrian port of Latakia , and a senior government officer compared to Fox News .	-5.9057
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said that it was at least one .	-2.1741
According to Associated Press , the goal was Russian SA-125-missiles .	-2.4567
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile supplies to Syria .	-2.8548
Foreign workers , with 457 visas , could be “ subjected to facts ”	-4.2724
The government is considering enhanced action on a “ echo test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-4.5371
If the test was introduced , it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to host unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the extension of family and friends to Australia .	-5.1871
Today , a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the Laboratory Party , Maxime McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be perceived as an insult by Australian neighbours .	-6.0578
“ Excessive statements like that foreigners are supposed to backfire and Australians are first set up , ” a very unpleasant return in times when unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she said today to Australia India Institute .	-8.4966
Historically , white workers should be protected – and if some in the region approve a echo of this historical artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.0382
The discussion proposal covers 12 measures that were once thought up by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-3.6935
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who spoke yesterday about smuggling of human beings in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the proposed amendments , and others are still being considered .	-4.5542
If the “ real interest criterion ” is accepted , then someone who requests a visa may be examined whether “ the application is true in cases where the applicant is linked or personally connected with the owner or an relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-6.9935
Businesses could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders , after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have abandoned hundreds .	-5.0577
In the meantime , a 35 years old Sri Lankan asylum probably died at a heart attack after having arrived on the Christmas Island this week with a refugee boat .	-5.1658
The nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been cared for by an adult cousin since the death of his father on Wednesday , who was also on the boat .	-4.2973
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.5092
The British Government announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.9523
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to implement high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.9618
Secretary of State Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.5166
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-5.2761
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.0807
At the end of Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-3.2142
In June , the government fixed the estimated costs of building high-speed rail between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-2.9044
The British Government , which is in contact with transport Scotland , has appointed HS2 Ltd to look for further track capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland .	-4.3920
This includes the possibility of travel time from eventually three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.5747
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network of tracks that brings Britain and its cities together . ”	-3.0781
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.2882
Without it we face a crisis of capacity in our railway network .	-2.6265
But there is also the connection between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.8881
The Scottish Secretary Alistair Carmichamel commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.3880
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for a “ unequivocal ” campaign for Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-4.5905
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link has the potential for huge economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time , Scotland ’ s economic strength provides an argument for rapid rail connections across the UK . ”	-4.4992
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for everyone and complements Glasgow 's link , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.8018
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .	-3.2117
Regulations on electronic aircraft in Australia are temporarily in force .	-3.1271
Australia ’ s flight passengers must continue to shut down Tablets and smartphones at launch and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease the regulations for such devices .	-5.7583
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their standards so that passengers can read , watch , or play videos on their devices during critical flight times , when they are in “ flight mode ” .	-5.2998
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-3.7343
Australian companies are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their regulations to implement them .	-4.2622
The CASA also declared that the announcement would be looked at , but emphasized that the restrictions on the use of electronic devices in critical flight stages in Australia still apply .	-5.6171
“ CASA does not currently have any specific rules regarding the use of electronic devices on the aircraft , ” it has been posted .	-4.5860
The subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines must maintain safety at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin crew .	-4.6416
Virgin has already held talks with CASA on flights to expand the use of his WiFi entertainment system and explains that it is open to change , but that should be initiated by the legislator .	-7.0649
“ We would welcome a review of the approval of the electronic devices by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-5.5562
Qantas said that it would remain with current regulations until further notice .	-4.7179
“ Our current directives stipulate that electronic devices must not be used at the start and landing , and we do not currently have any plans to change that , ” said the company .	-4.6612
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-2.0462
However , we are always interested in the developments in regulations that can benefit passengers , and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-6.3513
The decision varies from country to country .	-3.1020
They must be able to prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disturbances by mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , handbags and customer support .	-6.1709
“ Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can give passengers the opportunity to use sustainable , easier electronic equipment such as tablets , e-book equipment and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-5.8294
In rare cases of poor visibility , the crew will advise passengers while landing the equipment will be shutted down .	-6.4176
The group also recommended that heavy equipment be necessary for starting and landing safely under the seat or during the seating period .	-5.8200
In front of the Reverengby against Schalke , BVB trailers with axles provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-7.3218
Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced harsh consequences .	-1.8387
Before the football match against the VfB Stuttgart , the Ultra responded with a silence - initially .	-6.8758
It was an unknown , almost already spoken acoustical , which the viewer offered until just before the advent of the federal flag between the German Vice-Chancellor Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart at the signal Iduna Park .	-6.4549
The fans of the guests were able to listen with their singing .	-5.2201
The south gallery , on the other hand , is where the most faithful and loudest BVB fans are , initially , presented extremely quiet : no gestures , no cries .	-7.5033
The pedestal of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates joint fire , was not set .	-4.8710
And at the top of the grandstand a big flag marked " Frame Stadionbanned " .	-5.3331
Only as the goalkeeper novel Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player , took the place , brandished short jubel .	-5.4635
When his team colleagues followed , there were vocal songs and weeds - but not everywhere .	-5.0307
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Quarter .	-3.3718
Also that stage preacher Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of recent days - Derbywin , victory over arsenal , extension of the contract by coach Jürgen Klopp - not for holidays .	-6.6239
Only five minutes before the launch of the capo will be his podium - and until then it has been completely emptied into a noisy shrine , as usual , the atmosphere on the ranks in the stadium fell .	-10.7606
The last one was as always the south gallery - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was here again .	-6.2709
And as with jeep from the south galleries at the latest , the loud " Derbywinner is coming " , everything was as always .	-7.3314
Silence before , I think , was a response to what has happened in recent days .	-4.0596
In front of Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the busiest BVB supporters had set their way into the spectator and fired on the spot , meeting almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller .	-9.5709
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-1.4282
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top of the Dortmunder Ultra in his office - and Watzkes said , this was a rather unobtrusive date for the fanatics .	-5.9299
" There will be massive cuts for the entire Ultra-movement " , announced by the BVB Boss on Thursday evening on a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-4.1872
As an instant measure , Watzke subordinated the Ulils a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-4.0807
" I have banned this , " he declared .	-2.9819
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.6279
Moreover , the ultraperipheral has shown various ways of punishing them - until Tuesday this time has come to a decision .	-6.6442
Otherwise , Watzke , the BVB will establish a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.4569
" This will become drastic , " said Watzke .	-3.8953
The reactions in the south gallery can be curious .	-4.0377
Pfandbrief booms in Singapore , as the middle class crisis has arrived .	-3.5967
Janani Amirthalinga holds a golden bullet , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters .	-4.3166
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is my money there ” , says Amirthalinga .	-6.6446
Although every month they earn $ 3,000 ( approximately $ 1.730 ) as an administrator and work their husband , the monthly family income is not rich , explains .	-6.9444
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is so large that ValuMax , where she negotiated , became the third Pfandbrief listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-4.3696
Not only is the breeding of jewellery a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 , according to the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also nearly as cheap as a safe bank loan .	-6.4427
Typically , revenues in Singapore require an effective annual rate of 17 % , just over the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center .	-5.2980
However , deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need for a review of credit worthiness or income proof , which is why loans are available faster than banks .	-6.0138
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandbrief firms , after families are feeling the pressure to increase their living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-5.1058
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , based on loose financial policies in the developed economies , families with lower and medium-sized incomes are looking for Pfandbrief to compensate for the difference in the plumbing economy .	-6.4546
This week , the credit rating agency Standard & Poor ’ s growing fiscal debt , mainly through rising mortgages , was a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks .	-5.9497
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore have , according to the Agency ’ s assessment , the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product .	-3.0345
Malaysia has 80 % of GDP at the top of the list , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-3.3807
Pop-managers also care about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand , which has just come out of a technical recession this week .	-4.2004
On Thursday , data showed an existing export weakness and a drop in consumer demand .	-3.5327
“ In the end , this means that , given rising costs , people in the medium to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their incomes wherever possible , ” says Lie , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.8719
Historically high gold prices have increased the trend to feed personal items in the last two years , since people use the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-5.1281
In Singapore , approximately 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 Pfandbrief houses of the city state of gold .	-4.1401

The largest Thai Pfandbrief operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % growth in its stores in recent months .	-3.4244
The growth of the Pfandbrief business is so strong that ValuMax , operators of the stores in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to the neighboring Malaysia , where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , ValuMax ’ s Executive Director .	-6.0047
The company finances the $ 60 % of Singapore ’ s 66 million stock exchange , which it entered Singapore this week .	-4.2350
While some lenders have hit the crossfire due to high interest rates , Yeah explains that Pfandbriefe would not only serve more favorable rates than other lending , but also not directly raise the debt .	-7.3518
“ Customers are offended items that they already own , and the liquid-personal property does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-6.4121
Pfandbrief business is increasingly accepted socially as short-term , secured financing .	-2.8641
Nor are all the people who use Pfandbrief in financial difficulties .	-2.8408
Rich people from Singapore also come to the stores of ValuMax to fire gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-5.7517
We come from every social class .	-2.0925

Rescue package of more than 325 million Australian dollar for of ! ... ... ... ... ... ... , , ,	-6.5009
The Australian government is insisting on the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of more than $ 325 million in Australian health care to ensure that the federal government cannot give up the money .	-4.1780
Federal Health Minister Tanya Pliberek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic conditions and systemic restrictions .	-4.2680
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with independent Taiwanese colleague Andrew Wilkie .	-3.7063
“ The government created an emergency rescue package that , in our view , concerns the country ’ s unique challenges , ” said Plibertoday .	-3.7587
The $ 325 million dollar package includes $ 31 million in emergency help for election services .	-4.9000
Further 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments for gray Star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-4.7577
There is also money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better care for stationary stays , specialist exchanges , mental health services and the introduction of a system to electronically record health data in local hospitals .	-6.2260
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that the clinicians concerned told me they were the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” said Tanya Pliberek .	-4.7772
The Minister was on a rigorous reporting and accountability of the Tasman Government .	-2.7428
The state must maintain the current level of financing in order to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the extra money was spent .	-4.7716
A three-headed Commission is set up and will ensure that the State provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.4321
As Wilkie explained today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would put the public health system on a more sustainable course . ”	-4.1605
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-2.6458
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to bringing the state ’ s public health system off the list of concerns , ” said Wilkie .	-4.3569
According to the government of the state , these electoral achievements will largely be offset by the recent cuts .	-4.8308
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman , Peter Dutto , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ push ” solution .	-4.3820
“ We are in today ’ s position because the laboratory government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said about ABC TV .	-3.9728
It cannot be that a state government leaves nearly $ half a billion out of the system and involves 300 million of Commonwealth and then pretend that good news is .	-5.4392
Duttton asked Pliberek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-4.3040

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such as a surveillance group .	-2.1781
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and toxic gas emissions , has declared the global group of chemical weapons on Thursday , while in the north of the country there were severe confusions close to one of the sites where suspected toxic substances were to be stored .	-7.2570
On Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed soon since the civil war began three years ago .	-3.1846
The announcement of the Organisation for the Ban on Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) meeting a day before the deadline .	-3.5919
1 November , which set the Damascus Organization , based in The Hague , to destroy all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or to make “ unoperable , ” including all the machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling in ammunition .	-7.2842
To conclude this process , which is essentially the first phase of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at eliminating all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.9547
Destruction of facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.1561
Damascus , however , must begin by destroying existing weapons and supplies .	-3.1434
According to assumptions , there are approximately 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including sengas and nerve Sarin .	-4.2878
The announcement came at a time when , on Thursday , there were battles in the city of Safira , experts say that there is a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights , based in the United Kingdom .	-5.8321
On Thursday , 120.296 people died , the active group that tracked through a network of activists in Syria .	-4.4246

The observatory said that on Thursday there were losses on both sides , but called no details .	-2.2324
The struggles highlight the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous weapon arsenal is a race against time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.7080
According to OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and seen all of the major production and compound facilities mentioned by Syria and seen their destruction . ”	-5.1796
That is why “ no more inspection activities are planned . ”	-3.6617
Earlier this week , inspectors had explained that they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.8542
Due to security concerns , the inspectors said that two institutions had not been able to visit .	-4.5005
On Thursday , OPWC , the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to Syrian saying ... and the objects of the chemical weapons program there were moved to other known facilities that were inspected . ”	-6.4914
It was not immediately clear whether the place in Safari was one of the two institutions that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-5.5344
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month .	-3.0424

Fury over the Bali bombers	-3.3420
Long live and relatives of the 202 people who died in Bali in 2002 during the bomb attack objected to the judgment for the last of the appender who was placed in court , because Umar Patek , she believes , should be legally shot dead .	-8.5699
Father , who was killed just ten years as one of the most sought people of Southeast Asia , was condemned yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack to a sentence of 20 years .	-7.5907
It could be released after 15 years .	-2.2857
The 45-year-old mass crime was found guilty because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australia , and many others were injured .	-3.7415
A condemnation also took place in a number of anti-terrorist charges , including a wave of explosives on churches in Indonesia on Holy night in 2000 .	-4.9322
The prosecutor had demanded a life sentence , even if she could have asked for the death penalty for the man , who is also known as a master bomb builder , as a “ demi-man . ”	-7.1122
The decision has awakened painful memories of June Corteen , a mother from Perth , who lost their 39 years of old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his wife nearly ten years ago .	-5.4519
She said with tears that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-3.6053
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-2.3436
“ You should put him before a shooting officer , ” said Corteen opposite AAP .	-4.1679
I must live every day with no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters again .	-3.8158

He went into the Koma for one month after the attack and died three times , while in a conservation system .	-4.9401
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samurra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-3.7854
Indeed , this type should be the death penalty before everyone else .	-3.8378
To leave him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.5990
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much .	-2.8439
Patek is the last of the Bali Bomber to face trial .	-3.5183
He disassembled nearly a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in Pakistan ’ s city of Abbotttab in January 2011 , where US forces killed Osama bin Laden , just four months later .	-4.4615
During the negotiation , a FBI agent said that secret service reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the goal of restoring the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-4.9466
“ He did not face it , ” said Corteen .	-2.5909
Until recently , he has not shown a reunion for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-4.4728
The judgment came before the tenth anniversary of the attack this year , which is being commemorated in Bali and Australia .	-3.8904
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.2464
Patek can appeal against his judgment .	-3.3661
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not submit mobile phone calls )	-3.5118
Air passengers can now use their electronic devices to read , work , games , music and the image of films from their flight to landing , but not by phone , so the new directives issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-6.2141
But it should not be for passengers to expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-3.5218
How quickly they would be implemented by the respective airline , FAA member Michael Huerta explained at a press conference .	-4.2813
The airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline staff and the regulations for the equipment to be used in accordance with the new regulations .	-7.2875
The FAA stated that they have already received plans from some airlines that want to strengthen the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-4.3426
Both companies included delta and JetBlue .	-3.4080
“ Depending on the plan ’ s condition , we could approve the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-4.0833
Currently , passengers need to turn smartphones , tablets , and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-4.1587
They may only start again when the aircraft reached a height of three kilometres and gives the Captain the green light .	-5.2564
When entering the landing flight , passengers must stop them again and not start them again before the aircraft arrives .	-5.2516
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are protected from electronic disruptions may allow their passengers to use the equipment at launch , landing and on the roll field , the FAA explained .	-6.8262
Most new traffic aircraft and other airplanes that have been upgraded to larger heights should comply with the criteria .	-4.5843
Laura Glding , President of the Professional Federation , welcomed the changes .	-2.9648
“ If the new arrangement is fully implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit , ” commented Gliding .	-4.6994
We are frankly sorry to have to feel like beamer on this subject .	-4.6691
Nevertheless , Internet connections to surfing , exchange emails , text messaging , or downloading data under three kilometres remain prohibited , the Authority explained .	-5.0561
Passengers are required to deal with smartphones , tablets and other equipment in flight mode .	-3.7070
So there is still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble like online game played by actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his Smartphone when he had to leave an American Airlines Jet because he refused to shut down the machine while the aircraft was on the platform .	-7.8325
And heavier devices like laptops must still be discarded , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-4.8359
Likewise , mobile phone calls during the flight remain prohibited .	-3.7171
The regulatory competence for phone calls is the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.8440
FAA may include a ban on certain electronic devices starting and landing .	-3.4451
Last month , Mark Rosers said about the National Transportation Safety Authority , Safety experts for national transport issues at CBS News , mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-5.1085
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they may cause potentially disruptions to navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disturb sending masts , ” said ros.	-5.9602
Last month , an industry advisory committee that was called up by the FAA to examine this issue recommended that the government allow a wider use of personal electronic equipment .	-5.4255
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions for use .	-4.4139
Critics such as the Democratic Senators in Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there is no valid safety grounds for the ban .	-3.6016
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-3.9901
Some studies refer to the fact that up to one third of passengers are forgetting or ignoring the end-of-life of the device .	-6.2547
FAA began in 1966 to limit the use of electronic devices by air passengers after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment had become known by UKIP radios , representing the latest technology trends at that time .	-6.1569
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed in this way and approved by the FAA that they do not account for any electronic interference .	-4.1616
Passengers have been providing Wi-Fi for some years now when the flight is reached .	-5.4146
The fliers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interactions .	-6.4474
Most of the passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new guidelines , Huerta said .	-3.1870
Today ’ s electronic devices generally spend much less radio radiation than previous generations .	-3.1674
E-Reader , for example , only produce minimum radiation if you rotate .	-4.7957
But when downloading or sending data , the data is more powerful .	-2.8256
Among the beneficiaries of a relaxation of restrictions on the use of equipment by passenger is Amazon .	-4.6328
In 2011 , the company staff invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect .	-3.9017
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.8314
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he thought that the disruption of the equipment was real , even if the risk was minimal .	-4.6588
Other committee members have said that there are only united reports from pilots who are talking about aircraft systems being disruption , and most of them are very old .	-5.1205
However , the FAA committee recommended that pilots be allowed to apply for equipment shutdown by passengers in case of poor visibility .	-6.2729
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called it a reasonable adaptation for travellers , who would have extensive technology available today .	-5.4839
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.6982
Apply the air rescue service of Nordsee-Bohringel regulated bird again .	-6.5511
A bird flown by air rescue service on the coast , who had been found exhausted on a North Sea domain , was once again released into nature .	-6.7154
The watercolours were flown with a helicopter last month to Aberdeen , where they were encapsulated by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa .	-5.8183
Colin Seddon , Director of the Centre , said : “ This watershed was probably a wintry piston from northern Europe , held up by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-6.3439
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-4.1601
He added : “ He could not fly further , which is why we were contacted for help . ”	-3.8113
When they were released , the watertrack was once again sound .	-4.5642
Is Europe ’ s elite willing to do business with Britain ?	-1.4090
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of putting the economy on a table and defining what those in Britain who are providing for prosperity and work want to change in our relations with the EU .	-4.1102
To that end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders , asking them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.2152
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders , accounting for roughly the British corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.4265
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.0276
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe and are focused on countries that modernise and grow while the EU states are stagnant .	-4.5050
They want government connections to countries such as China , India , and Brazil to be favoured , rather than to stop the long and exhausting process of reforming EU institutions .	-4.9002
In their view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster , from cartels to product legislation .	-4.4789
There was general discontent about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s commercial zone – even 40 % of large companies voted the traditionally most European .	-6.0287
Finally , and probably most of all , our consultation of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority in Britain wants to see a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade not on politics .	-6.6413
This insight , which is found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that will return to the UK of action .	-6.0411
It is a lot – changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of keeping the EU in a referendum .	-5.1423
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership .	-2.5123
It also shows that businesses expect a clear shift in power relations back to Britain from a renegotiation .	-2.7956
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone moves towards a closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.9190
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-8.6155
Alexei Miller of Gazprom ’ s pipeline in Bulgaria was the beginning of a new gas giant	-3.7716
The construction start of the Southern Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the largest European energy projects , announced by the Gazprom Board .	-3.2374

A hearing before the Royal Commission : two YMCA employees face charges against Jonathan Lord for sexual offenses .	-4.0117
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been charged for sex offenses in relation to children before 2011 allegations were made against the child ’ s ambassador Jonathan Lord of Caringbah , as the Royal Commission claimed for sexual abuse of children .	-6.2167
But during the opening statement to the Commission , YMCA said that the organization never had to deal with an incident of sexual abuse . ”	-4.6658
Phillip Hare was asked about a case in which a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography for offences and another one in which a sports teacher from the YMCA Caringbah Hall of 1991 was sentenced to a child who was entrusted with him for abuse .	-7.2749
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission ’ s aides , that he knew of the first case , but did not abandon the second .	-3.8645
He acknowledged that YMCA ’ s opening declaration to the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “ there have been external inspections of the YMCA , in which YMCA has been recognised as the front line in child safety . ”	-6.1335
The evidence before the Commission shows that YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest evaluation of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Department of Education ) in August of the year .	-4.3962
Hare , who began with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the management “ failed to go backwards ” in the recruitment of Lord , and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety directives .	-5.2373
Lord was condemned to twelve boys at the beginning of the year for sexual intercourse during his two years of work for YMCA .	-4.1124
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.5131
Hare argued , however , that YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lords ' violations of children 's safety .	-5.0643
The employees said that they had observed violations , including that Lord was with children alone , holding them privately as babysitting , sitting on his lap , saying that he loved it , and making children play with his mobile .	-9.6519
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord was and who asked for a training on the protection of children because it was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service leader , Jacqui Barnat , who was the predetermined laureds in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time very unab. ”	-7.2467
The managing director stated that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report back to their superiors .	-5.0630
Instead , he said , had rather affected their friendship with Lord their judgment , which is why they would not have asked him .	-4.8969
Hare explained that he told the board of YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “ Jonathan-Lord case ” did not “ touch the login ” by employees , and the board agreed to him .	-6.7087
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the allegations was taken by the director of the Children 's Services of YMCA , Liam Whiteley .	-5.2611
He said that it was intended to prevent contamination of the evidence , but that was ‘ over-confident ’ and poorly implemented .	-5.3473
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization in the period when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , explained Professor Stephen Smallbone from the Griffith University , an expert on sexual abuse of children , the Commission .	-4.6289

And Toys received admirable acclaim for his performance and personality .	-4.5540
Fenton had become a present for his third birthday last March , and since every day since the Shetland Pony was celebrated .	-7.9483
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Coffee are a great bitch . ”	-2.3835
They had to compete against the whole participant field and took place with Goldpokal and Rosette .	-4.9281

The Chinese newspaper is to “ reform ” the calls .	-3.5970
A Chinese newspaper calling on the front page for the release of a reporter to be prosecuted for defamation declared a press regulator .	-3.9235
New Express , based in Guangzhou , had issued a rare public appeal to release the journalist Chen Yongzhouu .	-3.8746
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a partial state-owned company .	-3.8897
Now the New Express is being subjected to a “ comprehensive replacement , ” the regulatory authority has declared .	-5.2504
The “ Rectification ” was carried out by the Press and Publications Authority , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-3.9582
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several inaccurate reports about the listed company Zombicon between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-5.1397
“ New Express ’ s editorial management was disorganized , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-3.3689
She said that it decided to “ impose a administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and rob him of his reporting licence . ”	-4.6893
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to complete the re-engineering of the New Express and recommended that those responsible at the New Express be identified and immediately checked the New Express management team . ”	-6.3114
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zombillion .	-4.4874
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and supported his journalistic work .	-3.1498
But then Chen went on state television and admitted that he published false reports on payment .	-4.5367
“ In this case , I have damaged zoom icon , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he said in respect of the CCTV public news channel .	-6.1778
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-2.0465
It has become clear to me that I have acted incorrectly .	-3.9251
Following Chens ’ apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page , saying that you failed to check the reports correctly .	-4.8644
Several well-known suspects have taken place recently on television events .	-1.8816

Entirely discovered Tunnel between the US and Mexico	-4.4406
One of the most sophisticated tunnel for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electric railway operations , has now been discovered .	-3.9080
The US authorities describe the 120 times of 90 centimetres measuring tunnels as one of the most elaborate passages they ever had found .	-4.2317
The tunnel , which runs through a length of just under six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-4.1606
In the area , there are countless unseemly storage halls , making it easier to hide drug-bearing trucks .	-5.6365
The tunnel had been closed before any drugs could be transported inexorably in it , the authorities said .	-4.0730
When the tunnel was discovered , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine had been secured , the records of the court .	-3.9780
Three men who , according to the authorities , were charged with the possessions and the intended sale of Marihuana and cocaine .	-3.6398
They are threatened with prison sentences of ten years and life .	-3.8989
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers set up an extensive underground network of discharge channels .	-2.4492
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-1.2650
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which poses the challenge of how they can quickly bring their product to consumers .	-4.4279
In 2010 , authorities found a little 640 metres long passage with railways , losing from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-5.2191

Kerr and he loved still , stressed the 36-year-old man .	-3.2375
" We will support each other and love parents of Flynn " .	-2.5728
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and her usual Flynn was born in 2011 .	-2.6639
According to Lexika veganism is a vegetarian , but the difference is very significant .	-5.4784
For while vegetarians allow consumption of cream , ice or a strong Edamer , these skimmies are not on the menu of a vegan .	-6.9450
Milk , cheese , egg , next to the foregoing on meat and fish , the vegan leaves from all consumption of animal products - honey is also eaten .	-4.9693
What remains , one may ask itself , but with a closer look , the vegan world is characterized by a considerable amount of inventiveness .	-6.3209
" Brodofstriche are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , which holds a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.5275
Reuben Proctor is happy to visit the shop in Domgasse .	-3.2721
For 13 years , born New Zealand vegan lives in Lampedusa he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 , I my and .	-6.1350
At the turn of the century was the next step and I became a vegan .	-2.5857
" The conviction came not only because of the nutrition , but because of the shoe choice " , says Proctor , the synthetic leather ordinary leather .	-7.6954
He recognized that in other day-to-day situations it is not animal products .	-3.9985
vegan is above all an ethical nature .	-3.0380
" I don 't want animals to die for me " , Vector says the maxim of the vegans , which extends to the entire consumption behavior .	-4.3429
The Vegan quickly discovered new products , the enthusiasm rose .	-4.4626
" It is a dual bonus " , says Proctor today , " indeed vegan does not represent his renunciation , but it is an enrichment " .	-10.3432
And that is precisely what some people still tried to fail .	-4.8693
" The search factor is a very decisive factor that enables many to leave quickly , just like when smoking , " Proctor shows a comparison .	-5.7673
And note : " Don 't put it on your pet " .	-6.0129
Often it is the spices or the type of cooking that make up the taste .	-3.1871
" You can also generate the same effect in other ways , " the vegan points .	-3.9067
For example , with a barbeque festival , Proctor brings with it Aubergines , Champagne and a few vegans .	-7.5923
It pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , where it should taste it in a solid way .	-5.8571
Of course , one wants to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.9961
" It is meant to melt , but this is not just to reduce animal food , " says Proctor .	-4.4772
He did not suffer damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-3.6352
For me , the switch was a positive aspect .	-2.5952
I am not taking on a foreign cholesterol and have an increase in vitamins .	-3.9315
There are high-performance athletes just feeding vegan .	-2.8348
" My blood values are excellent , I often check me " , betrays Proctor .	-4.7632
Especially against the lack of vitamin B12 , many Veganism critics warn .	-3.6934
" Because animals are fed with feedingstuffs instead of grassy , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerant , the vitamin B12 percentage is high , " Proctor finds .	-7.6471
For vegans there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.7153
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.7450
Far ways should Proctor not go for food procurement .	-2.1832
After all , there are staple foods everywhere and every supermarket has soya milk and other products .	-3.3366
I find everything that I need on the ground .	-2.5961
I only buy something special from and on .	-4.2132
" Many people overlook the fact that only the finished products are expensive , but so are the actions of " ordinary " manufactured products well " .	-4.8901
The preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than generally thought .	-4.1683
" In the kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small bars you can get good , if not partly better results " , says Proctor .	-5.0045
With its vegan cheese cake , Proctor could also bring its sweetener to the dust .	-7.1724
The Vegan gives a new flavour .	-4.3356
The dynamic is very important if you decide to cook it together .	-5.7041
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves " , says Proctor .	-3.5461
Of course , he was also sceptical .	-3.4572
Do you not taste my food any more ?	-3.9563
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - on these kinds of questions you must act as a vegan with a fingerprint .	-9.4416
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society " , Proctor does not want an enclave term .	-4.2514
And , more accurately , the everyday world does not seem as vehement as suspected - and the vegans do not tend to be confined in everyday life as generally assumed .	-6.9544
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.0197
Pompides are available everywhere !	-3.2761
" Many Döner stores offer Falafan , or a vegetarian yfka , " says Proctor .	-4.7992
At a pizzeria he diverts from pastoring , or orders a pizza without cheese , everything a matter of habit .	-5.8045
The restaurants are so slow on .	-4.0413
" When I started to feed myself a vegan a 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult " , New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , call them " .	-6.8869
" If there are enough follow-up questions , they may be inclined to complement the menu , " he hopes .	-3.3107
Vegane restaurants develop , such as the comedy in Mannheim or the Café Vogel .	-3.9464
The organizers would like to see at least one vegan meal on the menu .	-5.2303
vegan dishes are basically there for everyone .	-3.1636
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.3362
" Meat courts are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others " , Proctor defines .	-4.5627
" If you want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority of the first impossible , " says Proctor .	-5.0948
However , buying vegan products can be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-3.8664
Particularly if you learn to understand that animal additives in the earth can be contained as a colour donor , you seem to leave the courage quickly with the addition of ethics to so many hurdles and traps .	-7.5090
Not only have Reben Proctor and Lars Thomsen wrote a book : " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are supplied with food and cleaning agents .	-4.2468
" After and after you develop a scanner information and know which characters and logos you have to respect , " It is sometimes better to do small steps than to remain or stumble , " says Protor .	-10.4174
Veganism , it is an important moral hazard that beats awareness .	-4.2442
Perhaps he does not quite manage to steal his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critically .	-4.3790
The trading operator , Nasdaq OMX , keeps its customers in flight .	-4.0957
The trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on the Friday afternoon of German time .	-3.4639
In a communication the operator was responsible for technical problems .	-2.1778
The other eleven US option markets , including two of Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.7139
The most recent incident continues with a whole series of small and larger panels at the stock market operator .	-4.1654
It was only on Tuesday that the indices of Nasdaq were not calculated for an hour due to errors in the transport of data .	-4.7291
In August of this year alone there were two pandemics .	-3.7580
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs has sent massive records of purchases to the options markets for technical problems .	-4.2999
As a result , stock market operators needed almost a whole day to watch and delete orders .	-3.8185
Two days later , half of the total US stock trade came to an end for several hours due to a computer panel at the Nasdaq-Base .	-4.5626
Last year the stock exchange was held by Facebook .	-3.2446

Konstanz : Radler service 63-year-olds around the world the of , , and , , , , , , , , ,	-4.7287
According to the police , the accident occurred when a 26 years old man on Thursday night was on Thursday night , at 22 p.m. , with a shuttle service on the left way from the train station station in direction of the market place .	-9.3152
When a 63 year old man joined the inn on the way , the bicycle driver , according to the police , could no longer slow down in time .	-7.3688
In the subsequent collision , the pedestrians were pressed against the house wall , later going down to the ground and attracted a roughly 15 centimetres of long landing at the head .	-8.0918

British police are admitting Assange a certificate of extradition	-4.7289
Today , the British police have handed over a extradition certificate to WikiLeaks founder , Julian Assange , who has sought refuge in the Ecuadorian message in London and has applied for asylum .	-4.7125
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had a “ call to stand up , ” which called him to come into a police station , and he added , if he did not attend , threaten him to arrest .	-8.3044
Assange threatens to extradite Sweden for having been charged in a sexual offence after its possibilities have been exhausted by British law since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-5.0817
Because he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the United States , he had taken refuge in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.5222
Scotland Yard asked a 40-year-old man to join a police station at a time chosen by us , ” a speaker explained .	-5.5513
He continues to violate the conditions of his release for bail .	-2.4341
The message did not make a comment on the sending of the police invitation .	-3.6497
Assange fears that he would be extradited from Sweden to the United States and charged with possible spy charges after having published more than 250 000 diplomatic messages on the AbüllungsWebsite WikiLeaks .	-6.7241

Taxation of foreign real-estate owners against London ’ s speculative bubble	-3.8998
The finance ministry has consistently calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who had imposed a 7 % imprint in the 2012 budget on homes that cost more than GBP 2 million and annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a company and not as individuals .	-7.5728
Already , revenue from the Stamp Tax for residential property in Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea district , which stood at <unk> 708 million in the tax year 2012 / 13 , proceeds for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North-East , north-west , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-6.2714
Cook said : “ According to the increases in Stampelstax on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation against a transaction , one can hardly claim that high-quality homes are too low , regardless of the impact of the obsolete municipal tax system . ”	-7.7458
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying property in London , or selling ownership of it , ” he added .	-4.2913
First-rate real estate – the top five to ten per cent of the home market at a price – in the wealthy London Southwest Belt , which spreads from Fulham to Wimbledon , has depreciated by the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-6.6317
Prices in Central London had an equal annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” in which the southern western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as a study of savills .	-5.3454
Scientists could shed more light on the context in which a dog ’ s tail is associated with his mood .	-4.2604
Early research had shown that happy dogs with the tail are jumping to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while with nervous dogs the left side was .	-6.4603
But now scientists say that other dogs can observe these subtle differences and respond to them .	-2.7883
Professor Georgio Vallortura , a neuroresearcher at Trient University , said : “ People know that the left and right brain hemispheres react differently to stimulation that causes positive or negative emotions . ”	-5.7292
Here we have tried to look at this with other species .	-4.5806
He also noticed that , in dogs , the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side , and vice versa , and that the two hemisphere played different roles in the feelings .	-4.3409
In order to learn more about how dogs respond to their sex ograms , researchers watched the animals while watching other dogs .	-6.5208
They size the heart rate of the four leg and analyze behavior .	-3.3635
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving one way or the other .	-3.7303
Professor Vallorta said : “ We have shown the dogs ’ films with dogs – either a true version or a silhouette to eliminate other aspects , and thus we could control the movement of the tail more left or right . ”	-6.0228
If the animals looked like a dog moving the cock to the right ( seen from the perspective of the weeping dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-5.6313
But the decrease was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , which snakes ) , soared their heart rate , and they looked unquiet .	-7.0402
According to Professor Vallortura 's opinion , the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-7.6404
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience what movements they should be concerned about and when not .	-3.9635
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the juggling with the tail in one direction is more affectionate and the right side produces less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of this experience . ”	-5.8404
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians , and trainers may help to improve understanding of the emotions of their animals .	-4.6575
John Bradshaw , expert on dog behavior and guest care at the University of Bristol ’ s Faculty of Animal Welfare , said that this was not the first study assessing whether left and right was important for dogs .	-5.6359
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they see an aggressive dog , and right when they are a satisfied dog .	-4.6741
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs tend to go on a robot dog when his , tail is hovering on the left and not right , rather than being calm – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-7.3008
According to his statement , the differences could therefore boast that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals as dogs in the films or the robot dogs .	-11.2640
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.1471
“ Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain units are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” said Bradshaw .	-4.5071
But since their behavior is easy to capture , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-5.2871

The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has postponed a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer was ill with a throat infection .	-6.1552

Pope Francis ’ s Discipline in February	-3.9432
Pope Francis , on 22 February , will first convene new Roman tribunals from the Catholic Church , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-4.2205
Carins are the highest ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also one who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will eventually participate in the election of his successor .	-11.2787
Currently there are 201 Cardinal Richards .	-2.0953
However , a Cardinal who reached a age of 80 can no longer take part in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinal classes . ”	-5.5646
In a declaration in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , the spokesman of the Vatican , said that there would be a meeting of all the cardinal canals before the ceremony was held for the appointment of the new Cardinal , which was also known as the librarian .	-7.2802
“ Pope Francis has decided to make advance of his decision to convene the Consistent Board in February , so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinal diseases from around the world can be planned , ” he said Lombardi .	-7.6778
Jack Valero of Catholoc Voices said that the number of eligible Cardinal Richards will probably have declined by February .	-4.5684
He declared that a Pope normally appoint as many Cardinal canals as necessary , so that the number of electoral cardinal generals returned to 120 , and as many of cardinal canals over 80 , as he would like .	-8.7084
Next year , the Constitutional Board is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , Valero .	-4.1187
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , particularly Italy .	-2.9638
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinal Richards from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-2.3940
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinal classes .	-2.8853
The ins of the Cardinal will also be the first to be called a group of eight cardinal canals from around the world , which have the task of finding ways to reform the Church since the Franciscan Council founded by Francis .	-7.7811
In the past , the Pope ruled everything on its own .	-2.5416
“ Now Francis has selected these eight Cardinal channels to help him , ” Valero said .	-4.0695
He explained that it was “ good ” that Francis called upon the Cardinal to the Council .	-4.0141
But , so far , we have not been in this position – it is all new .	-3.9388
Valero said that the bishops from large places would typically be called into cardiac camps , but Francis " full of surprises — so we do not know who he will be . "	-6.5748
GM is calling for new Pickup Trucks in the US to repair the Seat .	-4.2176
General Motors is calling back nearly 19.000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks , built in 2014 , to address a problem with manually adjustable seats , a communication from the US regulatory authority on vehicle safety on Friday .	-5.9645
Some of the cars have a defect in the mechanism for refusing the front seat .	-3.8623
For this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety on head restraints .	-3.7934
“ If from the back on the vehicle , it is possible that the head support does not properly protect the occupants , so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” the message was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website .	-6.3192
The returned models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.8187

desperate cry of an Obaman electorate	-6.7070
I have twice chosen President Obama in the hope that change is possible .	-2.3586
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts to be thwarted by the Republicans ’ blocktactics .	-4.0027
The blockage policy does not resolve the Obamacare website problems that drone attacks .	-3.1337
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what would have been possible .	-1.7433
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-1.7013
I am reading a sorry sorry sorry sorry book .	-2.3048
It is a book that I believed would unify myself during the second year of my medical college and give me hope .	-5.0238
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” ( the courage to win ) and portrays Memoiren Barack Obama ’ s 2008 presidential election .	-4.0667
When I am ready to sleep in the evening with my patient paper , the book leads me back to a time when politics helped to produce millions of inspiration and a talk to them .	-7.5732
The election was a landslide and news speaker bearing in mind the historic importance of this moment .	-4.2179
My classmates mocked joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-3.1334

Switch back to the present is a powerful awakening , as though one is taken from a dream .	-5.6787
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.5427
In the years since I first delivered my vote , something has actually changed .	-3.6003
But it is simply not what I could have imagined .	-2.0725
I recognise the great and diverse things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.6233
I , too , think that party political blocking tactics have hacked too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public health facility , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few .	-6.2034
But , once I have defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my explanation .	-5.1048
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.7319
The republican blockage policy cannot explain why the interception of foreign heads of state or the killing of innocent children in overseas .	-4.0306
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on Americans ’ private lives and why whoslequin are punished , public misconduct is disclosed .	-4.2954
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awakeski , an American citizen without trial , has been murdered , and that is why public financing and spending limits are being circumvented during the presidential elections .	-4.3289
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the efforts of the White House to keep the media in silence are the most “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-4.1928
And , younger , there is no excuse to design a simple site in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was adopted .	-4.7611
I do not know whether this is what I should have expected .	-1.9646
Whether I should have understood with 18 that the government ’ s work could conflict with its previous political campaigns .	-3.6681
It appears that the Members ' Office is not a predictable course , as a opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-6.2057
But if I look at the above examples , they appear to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.2608
And that disturbs me most .	-1.7369
I again elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.0075
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative , but he didn ’ t seem to be able to set his direction and positions .	-4.1869
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would meet the hope we had heard of for so long .	-3.9438
But , with the collapse of Obama ’ s assent levels to less than 45 % this week , the book ’ s return to 2008 has become much harder .	-5.1491
It awakens in me the yearning for the many promises that have broken up .	-3.6550

The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters would become pregnant and could benefit from it .	-3.9541
The Bergbauagnat , who is in a legal dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 taxes , argued that when he wanted to wipe questions from the table , he would be in conflict .	-6.5104
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important in deciding whether or not CO2 and mining taxes will be cut .	-3.8081
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and Abbott ’ s daughters would benefit personally from the laws .	-2.7196
“ He is in a massive conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters is pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.4138
Two months after the election , the Palmer election commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coastes of Fairfax with 53 votes in advance after the new counts .	-4.5712
Palmer called for a revision of the voting list process to be followed up faster .	-5.8329

Why should we not have a system where you make marching , putting the data into a computer immediately and then having the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-5.6249
Palmer was also critical of the use of pencil during the cast .	-4.5551
Is it used because you can radiate the results if you don 't like them ?	-4.2329
To vote with a pencil today is incredible .	-4.1872
The Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint New Zealand legislative proposal .	-3.7122

RBS suspended two Forex traders	-3.2067
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the worldwide regulatory survey on the alleged manipulations on the currency market is fast taking off .	-5.9559
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are working with the authorities on the world ’ s largest financial market , which is $ 5.3 trillion daily .	-4.8478
The two traders would be the first RBC staff to be suspended in the far-flung investigation that followed the Libor-Interbanking scandal .	-8.5460
The Bank , which issued no comments on Suspendees , confirmed this month that it received requests for information from authorities .	-4.2873
“ Our investigations on this issue go further and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-3.2064
Last month , the situation of close people revealed that RBS had sent the records of emails and instant messages sent from and to a previous trader to the British Authority , the Financial Behet Authority .	-6.3585
This retailer , Richard Uher , had left RBS 2010 and is now to have been certified by its current position as European head of forex trade at JPMorgan .	-4.5069

UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority , Finma , declared that it looked at a likely manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-4.7651
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority ( Weko ) , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently considering charges of bankers being required to deal with transactions in the currency market .	-6.1859
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said about the situation of confidential persons .	-3.1928
Banks break Instant Messages and E-mails from several years in search of misconduct .	-4.6625
The news of these investigations has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts the chances of speculators .	-5.6439
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.6031
A leading trader observed that , despite the massive daily volume in foreign exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of their own internal platforms by banks leads to “ being able to influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-6.2055
The news came out on the same day as Credit Suisse announced that it had issued a trader of their London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he caused a loss of just $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-5.4663

Before the action of the BI , the message ' We have been put forward ' .	-6.3952
However , that did not detract from the fact that around 20 members of the citizens ' initiative were involved in .	-4.6892
Her motto on the big poster was ' We are against ruins ' .	-3.1038
In this way she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - should one day fail .	-5.2349
In conversation with many people in front of the " construction site " , it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the project of the city will be better for many people , although few have the same questions about the dimensions of the project presented as the BI .	-7.1074
But they begin to reside because the city has been delaying these answers , that is to say the Lord .	-6.5944
As we have heard , public statements by the Mayor also work out .	-3.7458
In May , at the Municipal Council meeting , he said that he fears the thermal baths , the public should vote against plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow at the .	-7.2149

Rannick-Scherr for Kankis : Mane not a Goalkeeper	-9.1409
The sport director of the " Bullen " was so satisfied with the current shape of the German Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg .	-7.1408
" There is a dangerous tendency at the moment for Mane and Alan to be forced into the category of king of gakers , " he took the two offensive banks to a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-6.5782
The most recent occasion for Ranking ’ s criticism was Gelb for Mane at 3 : 0 , on Sunday , at which Senegalesen became a alleged spectacle - but not as the TV images showed .	-9.6868
" A stark misdecision " , said Rannick , the judge Harcame as " absolutely overburdened " .	-6.6417
Harcame also contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg Coach Roger Schmidt and Gardena coach Adi Hütter after the game .	-3.6844
He defended his German compatriot : " I would behave in the same way as Roger Schmidt in every single situation .	-5.6074
Schmidt himself wants to have had no contact with his colleague after the skirmish .	-3.8938
I would not know why .	-1.3623

" At least the boxes must be placed in the district of Neuschwand and Rosengarten again on Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck donner .	-8.1282

Mohammed Morsi abandoned office , but his Day of Triumph may not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt .	-4.4394
Islam Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt ” when he was sworn as the first freely elected president of the country , and thus the succession of Hosni Mubarak ’ s rat , who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier .	-5.1892
With his inauguration in front of the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-4.2239

If people had known too much of it over the past few centuries , setting the images of heaven and hell , " which still shape our ideas , " contemporary prophetic lessons of the hopes for completion are more of a certain amount of embarrassment or even linguistic impotence .	-8.5930
" The greater hope has been engendered by the religious critique , " the referee says .	-5.1432
You gave us so many question marks that the exclamations seem to have given us " .	-3.9690

You can vote for him or one of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose the CNN Hero of the Year .	-3.1833
The winner gets $ 25,000 to continue his extraordinary work .	-4.4296
For 21 years , Georges BWang saw how his sick father lost the consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-5.6365
Jamef Bwave was injured in a car accident near Yaioundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-7.2213
First , he had only a broken arm , but then there was an inflammation extending over his brain and causing a hemorom to affect him for the rest of his life .	-5.3245
“ There were no neurosurgical records in Cameroon , ” said Georges BWang .	-4.3820
We would have made it out of Cameroon if we had the money .	-2.7270
Instead , Bharan spent years accompanied his father in filled hospitals and hospital surgeons to get the treatment they had to offer .	-6.0009
“ It ’ s not easy , ” commented Bwave .	-3.6063
You can leave the house at five o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not first .	-4.0701
There are many patients .	-1.0327
Some people die even because they have to wait .	-1.3285
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell ’ s father died in 2002 .	-2.0901
Cameroon has only one physician for each 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-3.0347
In contrast , the ratio in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.2151
But even if there was a doctor for them , most Cameroon could not afford to visit .	-4.0002
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of domestic health spending are private .	-2.9240
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-1.5918
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.0875
His father and so many of his compatriots were tired of taking action in Bwave .	-4.4170
Dr. Georges Bwave and his team of volunteers conducted 700 free operations last year .	-3.0239
He was a doctor himself and is working as a surgery surgery in the Central Hospital in Yaidé .	-5.0936
He also founded a non-profit organization called COVIME , which travels in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.4368
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.0453
Almost every Friday he invited up to 30 people to minibuses and ride on the covered medical equipment over undignified terrain to the villages that need help .	-5.8510
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-1.4536
Even more than once , they had to pass the vehicles on through rivers and mud .	-4.0399
But when they arrive , they will receive as heroes : a feast , singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.8042
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and Bwave – with its wide smile and its limitless energy – is happy to attend the joyful celebration .	-5.2584
The next morning the team will begin studying hundreds of patients .	-2.5719
" We handle 500 people per ride " , says Bwave .	-5.4441
They are about 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-3.7111
Each of the weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-3.7022
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.5261
Others will be stunned , spectacles or free birth certificates – a document needed for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-5.6845
In the evening , the team will perform simple surgery with local anesth.	-3.6258
The operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the surgery patients are up and go in the relaxation area to make space for the next .	-5.6795
The illumination of the OP and disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group and so work Bwave and its volunteers up to the early hours of the morning on Sunday .	-4.4394
It is a demanding pensum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.5601
“ They strove all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says Bwave .	-4.5200
The team then goes back to the city on Sunday , tired but proud of the work that has been done .	-3.5010
The group – a mix of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with their work , it makes a huge difference to people who help them .	-5.3503
A man explained that the free operation of a truncate that he had received now allowed him to work again .	-4.4649
“ That is what changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.2311
In addition to weekly clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwave also works in private clinics in Yaidé at night .	-4.6511
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his nonprofit activity , so Bwave ; the rest come from private donations .	-4.0666
“ I really don ’ t know when he is sleeping , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who is studying and working voluntarily in Bwell ’ s group in the second year at Dreamxel University in Philadelphia .	-5.6723
He is always at hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-3.6215
For medical and hospital students like O 'Malley , coming from the US and Europe , and supporting Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-5.4775
“ We can be there in operations where we help to get rid of blood or keep the tools for Dr. Bharan , ” O 'Malley explains .	-5.3323
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.9793
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring often donated dental material .	-5.2862
But if they are only once in Yasoundé , Bwav will take over accommodation , transport and guidance .	-5.9710
“ He is undoubtedly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.7965
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no boundaries .	-2.8821
For Bshaft , the almost constant work is not a burden .	-4.3605
To help others to live a happier life , and to fulfill a promise that he gave his father , gives him great pleasure .	-5.9090
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwave .	-3.1814
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.1713
I hope he will see what I am doing .	-1.4027
I do it to make people laugh again and to alleviate the pain .	-3.2863

The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , Horst Janson is cut on the body .	-3.7742
Janson is himself an old hare in his butcher , the art of acting .	-3.0625
The old man , Santiago , has no fishing ground .	-3.8284
So they just complement each other .	-3.7870
You almost think you can see the wrinkles in the necklace of the old man from which the fishing young mango speaks .	-5.9307
If Santiago tired of life is sitting on the chair , that 's true with Janson .	-3.3940
The role of the old fisherman is also played by a character role that Janson skilfully mastered .	-5.8427
Hemingway told the story of a warrior , a man who does not stand up and eventually wins the battle against the fish through his knowledge and also his will .	-4.7490
Janson is on stage as the sole actor on stage .	-3.2008
He manages to focus public attention on itself , so that his monologues are no boring moment .	-5.0601
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of water are so genuine that viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue lights of water .	-4.6039
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man on the boat to the fishing village .	-4.5668
During his performance he puts the active scene in light : The hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her wonderful voice , enjoys a sense of life .	-5.9415
Cuba 's four musicians play a rhythm in this respect and are also guests of the bar .	-5.2649
Tourism : Down to the Romans	-1.4129
About 120 metres in length , a sewage channel from the Roman period has been preserved below Cologne .	-4.9860
The cathedral , which is visited by Cologne , is not .	-3.3597
Around 157 meters , the two towers reach the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.1366
But only a few visitors who make up the two filigranes of the earth appreciate that there is a lot to be discovered under the Cathedral .	-7.7858
Rainer Schulze is an expert in matters of Cologne Lower World .	-2.9798
The meeting point for its guided tours is the Köln-Tourism service centre directly at the Dom .	-4.6552
The tour starts very unspectacular : " We start in an underground car park " , says Schulze .	-3.5316
In the 1970s , the city-fathers wanted an autofair city , and that is why the remains of the old city walls remained only that which was not too big .	-6.2830
Most users of the park house now also share the same impressions about the Roman overrest and only place their car behind it .	-7.9855
But if you look more closely , the D2 Parkdeck discovered an archaeological site separated by metal base .	-4.4610
You can see about five meters high ruins of handstellen stone .	-5.1968
" It is the remains of the Roman wall built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " tells Schulze .	-3.2086
Before taking back to daylight , Schulze gives participants a glimpse of a dark , 15 metres deep chess at the upper level .	-7.0955
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly recognized .	-3.5920
The next stop of the round is the gate , and here the participants descend into the depth .	-4.7990
We are here the official residence of the former most powerful man north of the Alps , the head of the CCAA .	-4.0678
What CCAA means is a visitor ’ s message .	-3.9632
" The acronym stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinium " , which means " the town of Roman law and town of Agrippinese , founded by the Emperor Claudius at the site of the Altar for the Empress " .	-6.1077
And the preforum is the former fortress , the power center of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-4.6140
From the entrance of the exhibition , a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel , which has been preserved here for about 120 metres .	-5.3033
" You can walk along the " Cloaca Maxima " , if you want " , mundoll the guests .	-5.3757
A surprise still has Schulze .	-2.1440
After taking the key at the ticket , he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , feasible box .	-6.2345
" We are now in Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.7764
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground to come to the ground that was indispensable for ritual washing .	-4.5925
Until today , at the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins go back to the eighth century , can be traced to different rivers through varying levels of water from the Rhine .	-7.4451
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area at the Town Hall Square , for which the construction works will begin shortly .	-4.0876
