In June last year , the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals that broaden the name reduction in the Welsh Parliament .	-4.3891
On the question of the Members of the Assembly 's title , the Commission preferred Welsh Members or WMPs , but the MWP option received most support in a public survey .	-4.7756
Members of the Welsh Parliament appear to propose alternative options , but the fight to reach a consensus may cause a headache for Chairman Elin JONES , who is expected to present a draft legislation for these changes in the next few weeks .	-6.3889
Legislation on the reforms will include changes in the functioning of the Assembly , including rules on disqualification for members of the Welsh Parliament and the design of the Auschwitz system .	-5.6260

Athens has long insisted that the name of his northern neighbour is a right to his territory and has repeatedly objected to his application for membership of the EU and NATO .	-11.0907
The Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on the change of name , said he will ignore the vote .	-3.4495

Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with condominiums filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries of the district .	-5.4893
The overwhelming majority of people who buy property in these buildings will be aware , he said , " and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are fully closed , because it is unlikely that most of those people who gather in these property housing will become members of these churches ' .	-6.0730
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became the black metropolis in 1870 – Metropolitan Community , St. Martin 's a decade later .	-2.7656

A fire in 1939 was badly damaged by the building , but when Father Johnson ’ s community members made plans for reconstruction , they commissioned the bell game .	-3.9258
Pärrer David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor in St. Martin 's , called the bell game proudly “ the bells of the poor . ”	-4.0361
The expert who played the bell game in July called it another thing : " A cultural schatz " and " an irreplaceable historical instrument " .	-3.1957
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also noted that it was the world 's first bell game played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who , 18 years ago , switched to the bigger bell game at the Riverside Church .	-4.4905
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace it .	-2.7174
What has happened in the last few months at St. Martin was a complicated story of architects and construction entrepreneurs , some were brought by the Church 's Laiers , others by the bishop diocese .	-5.7156
The sacristy – the governing body of the parish composed of Laienkirche – wrote in July to the diocese with the concern that the diocese " would try to pass the costs on to the Saharan " , despite the fact that the sacristy had not been involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors of the diocese .	-8.5118
Some community members deplored a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese .	-2.6801

I have been born !	-2.6595
His whole key leg was shaken up , Hammel said , he set this firmly as he came to the boy .	-5.1321
I all cried for them to come out of the water : " There is a shark in the water ! " Hammel said .	-4.0113
The boy was brought to the Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego , where his condition was documented as critical .	-2.6013
The Haiar responsible for the attack is unknown .	-2.1618
The rescuing whale Captain Larry Giles said in a media meeting that a Hai had been beaten in the area several weeks before , but it was discovered that it was not a dangerous shark .	-6.1474

Furthermore , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop concessions in two Sainsburys shops , of which the first week was opened in Croydon , South London , while the second end of this year is opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-5.7970
Online shopping and relocation to the daily shopping of small quantities of food in neighbourhood stores mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit .	-4.3869
Mike Coupe , head of Sainsbury 's , has said that sales offices will increasingly look like goods houses , because the supermarket chain seeks to combat Discounter like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-4.5810
Sainsbury 's has placed Argo-Outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of habitats since it bought two years ago , which allegedly strengthened food sales and made acquisitions more profitable .	-4.6617
The previous attempt by the supermarket to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with a failure .	-3.1711
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000s , but it ended inefficient shifts , and the proceeds from the shops of the pharmacies could not be shared .	-5.0187
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's 281 branch of pharmacy three years ago sold to 125 million pounds to Cesio , the owner of the Lloyd Pharmacy chain .	-5.3225
Lloyds are also expected to participate in four Lloyd sites , with the aim of greatly expanding the range of luxury skin care products from brands such as Roche-Posay and Vichy .	-6.3739
Paul Mills-Hicks , the promoter of Sainsbury , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our shelves for beauty products to improve the equipment for our customers .	-5.0413
In addition , we have invested in the training of employees to assist the customer .	-3.6042
Our brand portfolio leaves nothing to be desired .	-4.3298

No one could believe what happened on Tuesday – just before the start .	-1.9979

For ten years now Willughby and his man , Dan Baldwin , Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been close .	-3.0227
Willughby founded Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones , 52 , joined as president in March .	-2.8587

Instead , he said , the US continued to apply sanctions to maintain pressure .	-3.1146
Trump took a much more optimistic view of his client base speech .	-3.0290
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.6975
“ We wanted to war with North Korea .	-2.3075
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.9215
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-1.2592
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results , such as ending rocket tests , the liberation of hostages , and the transfer of the mortal remains of American soldiers home .	-4.1142
And he defended his unusual actions when he talked about relations with Kim .	-2.4292
" It is so simple to be presidential , but instead of having 10,000 people out there who try to get into this fully packed arena , some 200 people would stand there , " Trump said and showed the amount directly ahead of him .	-6.2096
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake killed hundreds and devastated an island .	-1.6175
After the Lombok earthquake , for example , foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed .	-2.9027

The spokesman of the national civil protection agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would evaluate the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations can contribute to aid .	-3.2145
Unfortunately , in the face of the earthquake that Indonesia is enduring , the country is not well prepared for natural violence .	-4.4457
This is a common practice for other coastal lines .	-7.4398
The obvious absence of a Tsunami warning in Palu , even though a warning has already been in force , is likely to have contributed to the loss of human life .	-4.7521
Even in favourable conditions , travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult .	-2.1975
Natural disasters make the logistics even more complex .	-1.5711

The status of the Cromwell Parliament will be rewritten to the recent history history success .	-5.3236
His association would be poetic justice to his taliban-like destruction of so many of England 's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical Puritans .	-4.7961

Mr Goldsmith said about the ‘ Sunday Telegraph ’ : ‘ Cromwell is seen by many , perhaps more in the late nineteenth century than today , as a defender of Parliament against external pressure , in his case of course the monarchy .	-5.2137
Whether it is absolutely correct representation is the subject of the ongoing historic debate .	-3.2195
That is true : the conflict in the middle of the 17th century was shaped by the subsequent evolution of our nation , and Cromwell is a recognizable figure , which stands for one side of the divide .	-5.5578

As China becomes more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , Kai-Fu Lee says , Investor , and AI practitioners working for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-3.5508
These demands arose after US officials made pronouncements about KI , despite the lack of a formal AI strategy .	-3.8347
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-3.2500
“ Doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are lagging far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is close to coming , ” Lee said .	-4.9822
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US , said Lee CNBC in an interview this week .	-3.6549
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpoets : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ) ” published this month by Hougham Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese KI firms , Face + .	-4.4846
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University in an AI system that defeated the highest-ranking American Othello players .	-11.6907
Lee has acknowledged the former technology competition of the US government , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Agency ) , and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.2802
“ Researchers in the US often need to work very hard to get government subsidies , ” Lee said .	-2.3289
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of senior scientists , but companies , ” noted Lee .	-3.1149
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have set up university corpses in recent years to work on KI .	-3.5167
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could help the US strengthen its KI efforts .	-3.6654
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered Doctors in KI , ” he said .	-3.1684
In July 2017 , China ’ s National Council presented its next generation artificial intelligence plan ( Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan ) .	-3.4635
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to how the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-3.9813
Earlier this year , the United States Defense Department established a joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industry and science , and the White House announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-5.5446
And this month DARPA announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an initiative called “ AI Next ” .	-1.9955
As far as the NSF is concerned , it is currently investing more than $ 100 million a year in AI research .	-2.7649

Macedonia is in a referendum on whether to change the country 's name .	-2.8443
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name in the ' Republic of Northern Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece blocking its accession offers to the European Union and NATO .	-4.2696
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that its northern neighbour 's name constitutes a territorial claim to the Greek territory and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.9784
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia 's Slavic majority population .	-3.1555
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum , and , in view of a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the result will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the referendum ’ s validity .	-4.7376
The question at the ballot on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-3.6741
Advocates of name-change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth raising the price to institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries that will emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-4.4656
“ I have come today to vote on the country ’ s future , and it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means more security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.9183
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will follow the result of the vote to make it crucial .	-4.3616
A two-thirds majority is required in Parliament for the change of name .	-2.4394
The Committee on Rural Elections said at 13 p.m. that irregularities were not reported .	-3.8642
But the turnout was only 16 % – at the same time in the last 2016 parliamentary election , the figure was 34 % , and in the end 66 % of registered voters had cast their votes .	-5.8322
“ I went for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital , Skopje .	-3.3887
Macedonia 's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son , Mr Dushko , have voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on amending the name of the country , which would pave the way for accession to NATO and to the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , 30 September 2018 .	-5.7240
Before the Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and put chairs before the tents drawn up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-4.2795
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to take up with the heads , not through the service , " said Kavadakov .	-4.1385
“ We live in a poor country , but also we have our dignity .	-1.7851
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others like China and Russia to join Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.3827
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.2374
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev said after giving his vote .	-3.7941
According to him , the result would be “ yes ” a “ build-up of our future . ”	-3.2627
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would thus participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-3.0477
Another survey carried out by Macedonian Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.6837
Of those who wish to participate , 70 % agreed to vote in ‘ yes ’ .	-3.9942
The referendum will only be accepted if turnout is over 50 % .	-8.9564
The failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year .	-2.6185
See : Sergio Aguero of Manchester City on the way to the Tor transcends all Brighton defense .	-4.3851
Sergio Aguero and Raeeem Sterling completed Brighton 's defense at Manchester City-2 victory on Saturday in Eihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-4.1721
Aguero made his hits incredible easy in the 65th minute .	-4.5187
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine stormer in the middle field received a passport .	-4.1144
He recruited three defenders of Brighton to release .	-3.5992
Then Aguero was surrounded by three greens .	-2.8735
He circumvented a defender before going to punish several players on the brighton 's edge . , .	-9.0053
Then he left and gave it to Sterling .	-2.6194
The English stormer used his first contact to play back the ball to Aguero , which then shot right – past Brighton Torwart Mathew Ryan in the right side of the gate .	-5.7143
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” City-Manager Pep Guardiola said the reporters .	-3.4330
“ We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-1.9481
That has happened .	-1.1511
Fortunately , he shot a gate at the moment . ”	-3.4762
But it was sterling that first led the Sky Blues at the Premier League-Duell :	-3.3355
The gate came in the 29th minute .	-2.1691
In the game , Aguero of the ball was played deeply in the territory of Brighton .	-3.3763

Scherzer wants to play against Rockies .	-2.5985
As the national gamblers were excluded from the Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-4.2717
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to be able to beat the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are Playad implications for the rockies that have a lead from a game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the West .	-6.6785
The rockies secured at least one place in the league with a 5 : 2 victory over the National on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not safe .	-5.6417
" Even if we play for free , we can at least bear in mind , because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver will probably be the best of what we have this year .	-4.6821
Why shouldn 't I want to make any efforts ? '	-9.0350
The national have not yet announced a launch for Sunday , but are allegedly inclined to throw Scherzer in such a situation .	-3.8745

And they are determined to regain power with all the necessary means , and they do not stop even from shepherds and communities .	-5.0847

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.4635
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-1.0230
When instant activists in my local party voted to criticize me , it was hardly a surprise .	-3.1493
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour Members who say we are not welcome - only because we have said our opinion .	-4.0066
My group colleague Joan Ryan has been treated similarly , because she has firmly opposed anti-Semitism .	-3.4234

In the communication for the East Labour in Nottingham on Friday it says : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-11.1430
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meetings were exactly that on Friday evening .	-3.7088
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , soft ' policy is long forgotten if it ever started .	-3.5250
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leaders .	-4.3582
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s inauguration , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected I to make a reverse and take positions with which I would never have had any agreement , be it in relation to national security or the EU internal market .	-11.8734
Whenever I speak publicly – and it doesn ’ t matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media calling for a vote is denouncing the Centre ’ s policies and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-5.2842
This experience has not only made me .	-2.9494
I do know , in fact , that more luck has than some of my colleagues , as the comments that address me tend to be political .	-10.5984
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are exposed every day to a flood of sexual or racist abuse , but never go back .	-3.9554
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the scale of abuse has normalized .	-2.0405
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.6234
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or amendment to the rules of selection , the party will be smaller .	-4.1882
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to hold my neck , not to be so clever , and then I would be ‘ in order ’ .	-5.6418
But for this reason I have not come to politics .	-1.9690
This neglect led me as a student , because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , Labour , who literally collapsed my classroom , and as a result I tried to use for better public services for those who need it most , regardless of whether a community or a minister .	-7.0159
I have never hidden my political views , not even at the last election .	-2.4428
As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody in Nottingham East should have been in any way confused , and the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.2359
I would just like to say to those who supported the Friday proposal that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and to the Labour Party if the country is heading for a Brexit that is detrimental to households , businesses and our public services .	-4.5317
But the only message I have is not addressed to Nottingham Momentum , but to my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not deter threats to pick up or political opportunies from work in what I believe is the best interest of all of you .	-6.2558

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr unbeaten at the top .	-2.3555
Two late tries may have distorted the end result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennant 's Premier Match of the day .	-4.5376
You are now the only unabated version of the ten teams in the table .	-3.7988

Robyn Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-3.2620
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , converted by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain , Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Bagggot made a non-related attempt .	-6.2297
Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a penalty before he hit a hit directly at the half-time , and then made a solo search with which he succeeded in the 17 : 5 pause for Ayr .	-8.9201
Melrose , however , began the second half-time well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transforms Bagspot , reduced the backlog to five points .	-5.3531
There was a longer interruption due to the serious violation of Ruaridh Knott , who left the field on a hand .	-6.1352
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson got the yellow card , and Melrose then paid the extra man with a non-converted Bruce Colline attempt to end a flood of intense pressure .	-4.2157
The home page , however , came back , and when Strun Hutchinson received a yellow card because of a climo cough without ball from the border , MacPherson received a touchdown , the forward ayr on the back .	-6.8312

Throughout Bolivia , memory of a coastline lost in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century to Chile is still alive - as is yearning to return to the Pacific .	-4.8400
These hopes may have been at their peak in decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment of the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of discussions .	-4.4393
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and the purity , and naturally expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-4.3074
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Bolivia Tribunal in The Hague will favour the claim that , after decades , Chile will have to negotiate calmly talks to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-6.4090
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic Indian president – who will face a contentious fight for re-election next year – there is also a lot to do on Monday .	-5.0676
“ We are on the verge of regaining access to the Pacific , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.6645
However , some analysts consider it unlikely that the Bolivia court will decide and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not change .	-4.6224
The UN , Dutch , has no authority to grant Chilean territory , and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.8589
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after consulting the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-3.8873
Far from driving Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years could have rescued it .	-3.7130
“ The question of access to sea is used by the current Bolivian Government for its purpose , ” said Zárate .	-3.2243
Moral warlike rhetoric destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , it proposed .	-2.1679
Bolivia and Chile will resume negotiations at some point , but it will be difficult to continue the talks after that .	-2.8303

His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume the diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament three months after the meeting with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong-Un in Singapore .	-11.5746
Ri says that it is “ a miracle dream , ” that sanctions that continue to be imposed and the US opposition to a declaration that will end the Korean war , which will ever force north to its knees .	-7.0631
Washington will not agree with the statement that Pjöngjang has adopted comprehensive disarmament measures .	-5.1563
Both Kim and US President Donald Trump want a second summit .	-1.4402

The super-dimensional huts have clashed to the heels of " La Bomba " , the Strahhut with a 60 cm edge , which can be seen in every one of Rihanna to Emily Ratajkowski .	-6.7011
The cult label behind the highly unpractical hat spanning over Social Media sent another great creation on the running track - a straw bag that was almost as large as the bath model it used .	-7.7693
The orange , colored Bastense , filled with refined and white leather strap , was the outstanding piece in Jacquenus ' La Riviera SS19 collection on Paris Fashion Week .	-7.4576

John Edward : Language skills essential to global citizens	-2.6584
Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of academic excellence , which has continued with outstanding results in 2018 , as well as individual and group success in sport , art , music and other Community activities .	-6.0439
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , seek to offer their students and parents the best service level .	-2.9569
Independent schools are focused on preparing students – on continuing education , also at universities , on their desired career career and on their role as world citizens .	-5.6688
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , whereby modern languages are still popular and desirable in schools .	-4.2284
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ When you talk to a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-2.9860
When you talk to him in his own language , he goes to heart . ”	-3.5875
This makes it impressive that we cannot rely on English only if we want to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .	-4.2394
The results of this year show that languages are at the top of tables with the highest levels in independent schools .	-3.0793
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called “ Higher grade A ” higher class A .	-2.6784
The data of the SCIS ’ s 74 schools showed that 72 % of students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while students learning German , French , and Spanish received 72 , 69 , and 63 notes A .	-13.9740
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will no doubt need in the future .	-2.7244
Language subjects have the same rank as MINT ( mathematics , information technology , science , and technology ) in independent schools and elsewhere .	-4.8152
A 2014 survey by the British Commission on employment and skills revealed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had trouble occupying free jobs are attributable to a lack of language knowledge .	-6.0496
Language skills are therefore increasingly needed to prepare young people for their future .	-2.9352
Given more promising employment opportunities that languages require , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-4.2685
Irrespective of the career that someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he has a real advantage in the future with a lifetime capacity like this .	-4.0038
By allowing people to communicate directly from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of competitors .	-3.1215
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were not able to speak a foreign language well enough to speak , and French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.8238
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-3.4914
When children learn to speak multiple languages – especially those of developing countries – they will later have better opportunities to find meaningful employment in the labour market .	-3.2075
The schools in Scotland differ in their language offer .	-2.6669
Some schools focus on the classic modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in terms of 2020 , such as mandarin or Japanese .	-7.3385
Whatever your child ’ s interest , a number of languages will always be available in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-3.8123
Independent schools in Scotland want to offer a learning environment that prepares children well , and they should be given the necessary tool for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-5.2141
In the global business world of the present , languages are undeniably still important for the country ’ s future , and that must also be reflected in education .	-3.8914
Indeed , modern languages should really be viewed as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.3715
Independent schools will continue to offer this selection , variety and top quality for young people in Scotland .	-2.7486

Trump will certainly respond to the hearings this week regarding charges of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , who has to be confirmed by the Senate until the FBI has been completed by at least a week .	-6.1052
However , the main aim of these electoral events is to mobilise the Republicans facing a decisive election in November .	-4.3420
According to Reuters , the aim of the Trump campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week with the five electoral events to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and the House of Representatives .	-3.8722

Ryder Cup 2018 : The team USA is ready to fight to maintain hope on Sunday ’ s ingles .	-4.9330
After three unilateral encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-3.4454
The vibrating pendulum is a freely acquired sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-5.2078
So where would they say the momentum is now ?	-2.2952
“ They had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so there is a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he was going back for the day . ”	-5.5742
Europe is , of course , in favour of 4 points and twelve more are to be played .	-4.0062
The Americans , as Spieth says , feel somewhat winding in their sails , and there was a lot of excitement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played the whole day together , each with three of four points .	-5.8947
Spieth was initially superior and set an example .	-4.3148
These hobby junks were louder when his round went on , he wasted a crucial putt to reach an undecision in game 4 after he and Thomas returned 2 games .	-9.0002
His joy at the put on the 15th hole with which she won the game was that one thought he still believed the victory of the Americans .	-4.9808
" You really need to concentrate yourself and just worry about your own game " , Spieth said .	-4.5583
That ’ s all that remains for each player .	-8.4371
18 holes to give an impression .	-1.6640
In the last two days , uncontrolled Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-3.6424
Europe 's strange but admirable couple plays flawless and just makes everything right .	-4.0094
" Molivood " was the only couple who did not get a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-6.2334
This run and the way in which their energy seems to flow from the amount of spectator left , makes it the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes over Le Golf National , there is no more popular player who defeats a possible European victory as Fleetwood or Molinari .	-6.6370
They probably both at the same time on different holes .	-3.7417
To speak of a European victory would be too premature .	-2.2141
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.7787
With a bowy and two doubles on the first nine floats of the Spaniards and the Swedes entering a hole from which they never came out again .	-5.1594
On Sunday , however , there is no one to help you out of your hole . .	-10.3753
Due to the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change in the game , it is very fascinating to observe the Football and Foursomes in close proximity .	-5.8076
Europe has played better as a team so far and has taken on a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the American team has a desire to fight , some of which , in particular , have doubled Stateside .	-7.6313
Europe Leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Finaldate	-3.2371
Europe will have a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the four- and four-star games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-4.9190
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting tiger Woods to bring its previous record to four points in the Le Golf National .	-4.2692
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who asked for the preservation of the trophies that she had lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team fighting for murder football , and won the series with 3-1 .	-5.0237
The US offered more resistance in the four and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.6329
Jim Furyk ’ s team requires eight points from the 12 individual games of Sunday to keep the trophies .	-3.2774
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second pair winning four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.9575
After breaking Woods and Patrick Reed in the Footballs , it was considered sure that they would beat a humble Woods and American Rookthrough an 5 .	-7.1648
Woods , who hacked through two games on Saturday , sometimes showed brilliant actions , but he has lost 19 of his 29 games in four and four and seven following .	-6.5555
Justin Rose , trimmed for the morning Footballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and set Duntin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-5.5924
At a pleasant and airy day south-west of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-3.7498
The three main victors Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas put the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-3.1923
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Pouler in the fourth pack and returned later to fight Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the fourth pack after losing the first two holes .	-6.1981
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story , a team will return from a four-point deficit to the singles , even though Holter Furyk 's page needs only one undecided to keep the trophies .	-5.1584
After two days of two-fold , a Sunday converter looks like he would go beyond them .	-4.6063
North Korea says that there will be “ by no means ” a unilateral disarmament without confidence .	-4.3590
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen his distrust of the United States and that , under such circumstances , the country would not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.9227
Ri Yong Ho , the annual General Assembly of the World body , said that North Korea took ' major goodwill measures ' last year , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the reduction of nuclear testing , and the obligation not to distribute nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-12.7519
" But there is no response from the US , " he said .	-2.7040
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we could disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-3.6727
While Ri restruck North Korea ’ s well-known complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to de-nuclear decolonisation , in which North Korea would reap with gradual steps , his explanation seemed significant insofar as it did not entirely reject unilateral de-nuclear , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-7.9214
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US President and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to work on " de-nuclear the Korean Peninsula " , while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-4.9179
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons .	-3.0299
Washington has also resisted the calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-3.4159
The US insists on ' de-nuclearization-first ' ( first de-nuclear ) and increases the pressure from sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , and even reject the ' Declaration of the War ' , said Ri .	-6.6855
" The perception that sanctions can force us to knee is a miracle dream of people who are ignorant to us .	-3.3815
But the problem is that the continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust . ”	-2.5383
Ri mentioned no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , highlighted by the US President at the United Nations earlier this week .	-2.8532
The minister instead raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in in the last five months , adding : " If the party were to be in this question of denunciation of South Korea and not the US , then disnuclear the Korean Peninsula would not have fallen into such a deadlock . "	-14.1631
Yet Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year ’ s when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly targeting the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump called Kim a “ rocket man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.5668
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy North Korea , ” Kim praised for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea dissolved .	-5.3754
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe for this , saying : ' It doesn ’ t matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months ' .	-3.9729
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pjöngjang for the steps undertaken .	-2.5335
However , in the US Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN on Thursday that : ' Enforcement of the Security Council 's sanctions must be pursued vigorously and without any discrepancy until we implement full , definitive and verified denuclearisation ' .	-5.6344
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the financing of nuclear and ballistic Pjongyang ’ s rocket programmes .	-4.3630
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he will return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.7091
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.0093
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made , just a few hours later North Korea condemned him to “ address similar demands . ”	-3.5525
During a meeting with Moon , North Korea promised to dismantle a rocket state and also a nuclear complex this month , if the United States takes ' measures .	-5.1228
He said , Kim told him that the " appropriate measures " he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.8420
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-1.7892
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students will get more sleep to fight against the growing Macho culture of studying the coffin-deprived “ pernicious nights ” .	-5.8845
A scholar has found that students at a world-leading university are often irreversible when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.9068
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the US .	-4.7011
It was inspired to start the course after holding a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on learning .	-3.1081
In the end a girl came to me and said : " Why is this only now , in my closing year , told me ?	-4.0059
She said that you never told someone of the meaning of sleep – which surprised me - " he told the telegraph .	-4.8009
The course that is offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sex habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general wellbeing .	-4.8515
Paul Barreira , professor of psychiatric at the Harvard Medical School and Director of the University 's Health Service , said that the university decided to set the course after it found that the students had lagged extremely little during the week .	-6.1196
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.5904
In a section , there is an image of a sleep hall where students click on coffees , presets , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and how sporting performance influences the lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep time routine .	-7.0691
In a further section , participants are explained how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , fall , depression , and cancer .	-5.4122
A map of the campus with interactive icons encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-2.7516
We know that student behavior will not change immediately .	-2.0367
" But we believe they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health consequences of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Czeisler added .	-4.2137
The culture of pride still exists , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students to make sleep deprivation a growing problem .	-4.2089
Having a good quality sleep should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion , and fear , he said - also to not accept , as sleep deprivation leaves the brain in hunger mode and makes it constantly starving .	-6.9761
Raymond Thus , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he visited one of his classes in Harvard last year .	-3.3625
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to press a campus course .	-3.3240
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all the Photorandes to undertake a similar study program before entering the high school .	-5.7515
Prof. Czelller recommended students to give an alert when they should go to the bed and when they should wake up , and be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " that is emitted by electronic screens and LED lighting that can bring their circular rhythm out of the clock , which leads to problems in the enclosure .	-7.5740
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal handles Gerrards men .	-3.8189
Another problem for the Rangers : After a meeting of Dolly Menga , Livingston reached 1-to-0 defeat for the unsome team of Steven Gerrard .	-7.0518
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4 : 1-triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but the Gary Holt team added Gerrards ’ second defeat in 18 games as a trainer , who returned his team by eight points behind the disappointed Laden Prime Minister Hearts .	-6.9566
Menga landed seven minutes before the half-time a hit and an inspirational Rangers setting did not look like a compensation .	-5.9209
While the rangers are now falling on the sixth place , Livingston climbing on rank three and are only due to the Tordifferenti behind Hibernian .	-7.1482
New difficulties for the ranking are emerging , as a headscarf had to be supplied to Linierturer Calum Spence after it was hit by a litter – apparently swept away from the field of heat fans .	-9.6738
Gerrard made eight changes to the page , passing on to Ayr and pressing directly into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-6.0059
On the other hand , Holt raised the same Lifi-Elf , who took a point last week in the Hearts , and he would have liked to see how his well-trained team did not allow the opponents to take action at any time .	-7.9372
Although the rankings dominated ball-ownership , Livingston ’ s chances were better .	-9.4453
You should have met after just two minutes , when Mengas first editor Scott Pittman sent to the Allan McGregors Tor , but the middle field player forbid his big change past the gate .	-6.4750
Keaghan Jacobs 's deep-freelance then went to captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner , Alan Lithgow , could only go far towards rear costs .	-6.3018
Rangers took over control , but there seemed to be more hope than space in their own game , last third .	-5.3176
After the expiration of the first quarter of the hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that he deserves an elfmeter after he and Steven Lawless clashed , but the referee Steven Thomson did not go to the Colombia appeals .	-7.5657
The Rangers reach only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox Torhüter Liam Kelly was hardly by Lassana Coulibalys 's head jump and the meeting of a bistro Ovie Ejaria out of peace .	-6.8357
Although Livin ’ s inaugural meets may have been in the 34th minute , contrary to the course of the game , no one can deny that they have earned it for their efforts alone .	-6.2305
Once again , the ranking failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.4722
Scott Arfield did not reacted when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the rest and cast Menga out for a simple finish .	-4.6254
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the amazing Kelly ran from his line to block .	-6.5075
But Livingston always drew guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and hooked after long balls .	-4.9890
Holt ’ s team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well off to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner .	-5.3231
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had a further belated claim to a punishment , since he got his way with Jacobs , but he once again watched Thomson .	-6.4478
Almanach : The Originator of the Scourge counter	-4.6710
And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger , was born in Germany .	-4.7606
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as Geiger counter .	-3.4552
The scourge counter has also become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which appears to be infamous cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-6.0965
Mann : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.3407
Rogers : “ It is a hostile counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.4391
If you put up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-3.5525
Evans : “ Say , now it is crashing but huge ! ”	-5.0224
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 6th birthday .	-7.0635
But the invention that bears its name will continue to be used .	-3.0468
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-2.2684
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-2.6460
Vaccine teaches immune systems to detect malign cells as part of treatment .	-2.2839
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of those in the laboratory .	-2.8878
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then inject them again .	-3.0872
A study vaccine shows promising results for patients with a number of types of cancer .	-2.4082
A woman treated with the vaccine that brings the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw her egg cancer disappearing for more than 18 months .	-4.2650
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , to change it in the laboratory , so that a protein named HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many cancers , and then inject the cells again .	-5.0056
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . '	-2.9777
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different types of cancer , ” including breast , egg , lung and intestinal cancer , said Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.4788
A similar approach to deprive patients of immune cells and teach them how to attack cancer cells has worked in the treatment of a kind of leukaemia .	-3.9358
After his appearance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA Mütze , gave a pro-Trump timeline from the stack .	-6.8859
It was not good .	-2.1947
Kanye West was buried in the studio during a Saturday Night live show after a remote speech in which he praised the US .	-5.4741
After playing his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while playing a Make America Great Matter , he stood up against the Democrats , affirming his support for Trump .	-5.7435
" So often I speak with a white person and she says , " How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? "	-3.1489
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America long ago " he said .	-2.9721
The saturday night live show began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon board Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee regarding Christine Blsey Ford ’ s accusations , Kavanaugh forced them sexually .	-5.7019
Although it was not broadcast , Wests Geschätz ’ s film material was divided by the comedian Chris Rock in the Social Media .	-4.9416
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with its contribution .	-3.6716
West had also complained to the audience that he had had had difficulty behind the stage because of his headscarf .	-4.2330
" They sent me behind the stage .	-1.2507
You said : ' Do not go with the hat da out ' .	-3.4368
You annoyed me !	-1.8725
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-3.3747
West continued : " Do you want to see the cloudy place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman overhang because that means you cannot tell me what I should do , because you want the world to move forward ?	-6.6834
Try it with love . ”	-2.1624
His comments were spelled at least twice by the audience with a bucket and the comedy of Saturday Night Live appeared to be moved , reported variety and quoted a person with the words : “ The whole studio was totenstill . ”	-11.9217
West was used as a later replacement for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend Rapper Mac Miller died a few days ago .	-3.2407
West admired many with a performance of the song " I Love it " as Perrier Bottle .	-2.9672
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , the twitter : " This is for one of the most courageous ghosts : DANKE , DASS DU DICH THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST " .	-3.2464
But Talkmasterin Karen Hunter twitter said that West is simply what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful .	-3.0374
“ But I will not reward anyone ( buying his music or clothing , or supporting his art ) that I believe he adopts and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-4.4486
It is free .	-0.6348
We also added it .	-1.4842
Before the show rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now called “ the former known as Kanye West . ”	-4.5391
He is not the first artist to change his name and enter the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-3.6415
Mitrapper Snoop Dogg had the name Snoop Lion and , of course , the future music prince , changed his name into a symbol and then the artist who was known as Prince .	-4.6264

“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were impaired as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the fact that this information was fraudulent .	-4.5464
This unsubstantiated claim is completely false and an absolute lie .	-9.2717
Waters 's statement quickly led to criticism online , including the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-4.6796
“ That the matter is cured is extremely annoying , ” meat wrote .	-5.0265
“ This suggests that it is unsuitable as a member of the Congress .	-3.1730
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.3734
They must not be enlightened .	-2.8025
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-1.2103
They need to be calm and relaxed . ”	-2.3922
Meatcher seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , who was accused of critics to appear furious during the Thursday hearing .	-5.4918
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who runs alongside the seated Water in the mid-term election , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-3.8281
“ Big , if true ” , he bet .	-2.5521
In its statement , Waters said that her office " informed the authorities and law enforcement authorities of fraudulent claims .	-3.4466

Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.4772
It is a tradition to search for Brexit in any new film with a British tendency , and that seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy-Spof-Franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was reintroduced in 2011 with " Johnny English Reorn " .	-6.3656
Is the ironic self-satire about the abysmal humanity the new export opportunity of the nation ?	-4.0341
In any case , the glotty , gummy , and incompetent Johnny English have been granted the license to reintroduce things .	-6.9589
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims of Smoothie-Glamour , received a little Cloose-eau , a Spritzer Bean and a sound from this guy , and who has contributed a single note to the chief melody of firefighters at the opening ceremony of the London 2012 Olympic Games .	-8.5032
It is also based on the traveler and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once cooperated in the now forgotten Barclayard screenings , always leaves behind chaos .	-6.2341
There are one or two nice moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.6770
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and the main rotor briefly beats his helmet .	-12.4497
Atkinson 's talent for body Comics is to be seen , but the humor feels quite weak and strange superfluous , especially since the " serious " film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible self-confident comedy offer . . the , , and . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.0703
The humor feels like it is directed to children rather than adults , and for me the mad misfortune of Johnny English is not as inventive and focused as Atkins Mr. Bean Stummfilme .	-4.7872
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-3.2511
A cyber hacker infiltrated the British high secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , the horror of the service agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-4.7334
Emma Thompson does her best with this quasi-Teresa-May-Fighur , but there is not much in the script with which to work .	-5.1007
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as each individual active spy has been compromised , it has to catch someone out .	-4.8038
And that means , the great patchy Johnny English itself , who is now a schoolmaster in a noble institution , but unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy on spy .	-6.8281
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency strike and reunited with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , once again played by Ben Miller .	-4.5712
Bough is now a married man who comes to a submarine commander , an overtired burschikose role , in which Vicki Pepperdine does not entirely assert .	-6.1512
So the Batman and Robin of Chaos are back into action again at the Secret Service of their Majesty and meet on Olga Kurylenko 's beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-4.9828
Meanwhile , the prime minister is dangerously in the ban of the charismatic tech billionaire , who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-5.0639
English and Bough begin their colorful Highjinks : As a Kelner , they ignite a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas Luxusyeight ; and English throws anarchy as he tries to familiarise himself with a virtual reality headset with the inside of Voltas house .	-6.4450
I am sure all the registers have been pulled for this last sequence , but so kindly and cleared it is , it reminds us of the whole thing of children .	-8.3607
It is trivial .	-2.6464
And , as with other Johnny English films , I could not reconsider : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that is really fair to his talent ?	-5.2286

The trade union Congress approved the transition to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-3.8076
A high-level source of the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-3.2937
A four-day day week is a goal that is in line with the party ’ s approach to rebuilding the economic balance in favour of workers and the party ’ s overall industrial strategy , but it will not be possible to achieve overnight .	-5.6070
The Labour Party would not be the first to advocate such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign in 2017 .	-2.6298
At the moment , however , the whole Labour Party does not support this push .	-2.9953
A Labour-Party spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-3.6964
Chancellor John McDonnell took advantage of last week ’ s Labour Party Conference to concrete his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-3.8747
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit-makers ' from utilities .	-4.1918

On the basis of an ongoing FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on the judge ’ s appeals to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week , and the question is whether the FBI ’ s findings could lead to republican senators giving up their support for Kazanahog .	-8.2817
In an interview broadcast on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” who republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham questioned whether the FBI ’ s results could induce them to change their mind .	-4.9599

He was determined , targeted , unequivocal . '	-1.3765
But Graham 's voice seemed to be painted in stone .	-2.9191
" I have a opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would require a bombing , " he said .	-4.4251

" What is the Global Cities Festival and has ensured poverty reduction ? "	-2.6269

At this year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival , tens of thousands of people will gather in the Great Lawn in Central Park to see not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the real goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.9443
The Global Citizen Festival , held in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-3.3412
In order to get a free ticket for the event , the concerts had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering , an email to a leader in the world , a telephone or another useful way of increasing the objective of combating poverty and increasing awareness .	-14.7766
But how successful has Global Cities been to achieve its goal at 12 remaining years ?	-3.5990
Is the idea to reward people with a free concert , a real opportunity to convince people to call for action , or just another case of the so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel like sending a tweet by signing an online petition or an online application , or by making a tweet , as though they would make a real difference ?	-6.1777
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , more than 19 million “ actions ” have been reported by his supporters pushing for a variety of targets .	-4.8495
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-3.5692
In early 2018 , the Group introduced 390 approaches and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion have already been paid out or financed .	-4.6002

The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom , which were aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition , the government will meet the financing of the ' Power of Nutrition ' project for 5 million women and children with food support .	-13.0663
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website : “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.4239
Global citizens responded : there will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.6418
Like the big civil law and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed because we are more powerful together .	-3.0693

Washington can resort to its Marine if necessary to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-4.3692

Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself a “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.9036
He abused Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , and found that they are actually equal .	-3.7833
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-trick pony " with a fossil-fuel economy .	-12.1376
The opinions came , while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its inflated natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-5.0032
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are thus trying to make Germany a halt to the “ inadequate ” North Stream 2 Pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin a “ prisoner . ”	-5.7807
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 111 billion pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters , is a purely economic project .	-3.0239

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt less valuable because of its sexuality .	-2.3010
The olympic diver Tom Daley says he has grown up with the feeling of being inferior to all because of his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-5.4180
The 24 Years said he had only realized at the secondary school that “ not everyone is as I ” .	-4.2060
In the first issue of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 , Lauren Laverne said he publicly talked about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.1670
He also said that a victory at the Olympics after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.8563
The regular presentation of the long-running show , Kristy Young , released several months due to a disease .	-3.5638
Daley joined Lavernes ’ first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” as a teenager than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-6.0357
He said , “ Up to now , these feelings of Weniger ’ s value and strength gave me the strength and strength that I needed to be successful . ”	-5.7776
He wanted to prove that he was “ something , ” he meant not to disappoint anyone when he led from his sexual orientation .	-4.3343
The twin bronze medal player has become a top-class LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year ’ s Commonwealth Games in Australia to demand more countries to criminalize homosexuality .	-5.1208
He said he was speaking out because he was lucky to be able to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give other ' hope ' .	-4.1239
The three-fold World Champion said he was in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , which he was very surprised .	-5.2041
Daley married the Oscar winner , who is 20 years older than he , last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-4.0516
“ If you do so much in such young years , ” he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time in 14 years , three years later , his father died in cancer , whether he was difficult to find someone at the same age who experienced similar high and low .	-7.0018
The pair was born in June , a son named Robert Ray Black Daley , and Daley said his " whole perspective " changed .	-3.8163
“ Last year , for me , he turned all about winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-2.5325
“ But you know what is more important than Olympic gold .	-2.5126
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.9177
His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 only 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-2.3444
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-3.0032
“ I could not say to him : ‘ You will not experience sitting in the first row , Dad ’ , he said .	-3.3888

The formal Micklon was on the bank ’ s Ryder Cup Symphony .	-4.5375
American Phil Micklon will record a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he must dramatically improve his form so that no sad milestone will be made .	-5.3612
Micklon , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Football and Foursomes on Saturday .	-4.4954
Instead of being at the heart of the event , as is so often the case for the United States , the five-time majority winner gave his day to fire and practice rounds on the golf course , in the hope of overcoming his depth .	-7.6271
Even at the peak of his career , the 48-year-old driver is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-12.2354
And as if the seat alone would not be challenging enough , Micelson in the ninth match meets on Sunday the British open-Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-5.9337
If Americans lag behind four points at the start of the 12 individual games and have a hot start , Micklon ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.7917
Furyk expressed his trust in his man ; that was what left him .	-3.4661
" He has fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on his back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.8093
“ He has a lot of confidence .	-1.7214
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-2.4455
I would probably not have thought that he played two games .	-2.4007
I wanted to see it again , but it was the way in which we felt we had to deal with it .	-6.2747
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.7271
So far , Nick Faldo has the record of most spoken matches at the Ryder Cup .	-5.0405
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career , which has never really adapted to the height of his individual record .	-4.0012
Micklon won 18-times , lost 20 times and played for seven times less .	-6.1183
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.9257
I think the younger players had fun this week to measure with him , that was nice to see . ”	-4.1327
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.5005
The European captain , Thomas Bjorn , knows that a major lead can disappear soon .	-2.7726
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a major advance in the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an inconvenience .	-4.8795
The Dane debuted in 1997 in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only scored on the target line and won the 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> with a very thin advance .	-7.3445
" It is worth recalling that one was in Valderrama ; we had a big lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won but only short , " said Bjorn , after he saw the class of 2018 , now leading with 10-6 in Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at a 5-3 victory .	-7.2810
The story will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.9205
You will be completely bored tomorrow .	-2.2477
Go there and do the right things .	-1.1900
The points on the table are only over .	-3.8106
Our goal is to win this Cup , and we focus on it .	-2.9439
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we have to do with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-3.3087
Bljörn added , as his players played on a hard golf course , " I would never be fast in this .	-4.2507
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.9678
Tomorrow there are the personal performances , and that is another matter .	-2.8319
It 's great to be out with a partner when things are going well , but if you are out there alone , you 'll have to test your own skills as golf players .	-6.7002
This is the message you need to convey to the players : get the best out of them tomorrow .	-3.7452
Now you are greeted to your partner and it needs to do just as you can . ”	-5.5058
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will seek to reduce the number of players separately than they do as partners , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have taken three out of four points .	-5.5240
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn on the final day , when he was part of the winning team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team had completed the “ miracle of mediachts . ”	-5.8329
" I remember every word given , " he said how Ben Crenstaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on the way in the last day .	-5.4287
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get rid of them as soon as possible , as we saw in Brookline , in Medieval close .	-5.5527
Once your own dynamic has developed , the heavy pressure on the medium match is exerted .	-5.8091
We have built our site accordingly and robbed the boys as we felt , you know we try to make something special tomorrow . ”	-5.8750
Thomas should join Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , the other European at the top places in the Rangle , to lead the counter-strike against Rory McIlroy .	-6.7852
I put this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about its individual selection .	-3.1171
Renewing the timetable for Germany ’ s new warship	-2.7352
The new french of the German navy should have been put in service in 2014 to replace the years of the Cold War warships that had been replaced , but it will take at least until next year because of malformed systems and escalating costs .	-9.9624
The start-up of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the flagship of the brand new Fregatten of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ Die Zeitung ” on a military spokesman .	-6.3947
The Marine would have been supposed to operate its ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery burden the ambitious project .	-5.1626
The four aircraft ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-4.4987
It is estimated that they have a powerful canon , a number of flight defensive and ship defence missiles and some stealh technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-6.3853
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest freeways should be ready for two years without running the home port .	-5.7885
However , the highly modern warships that will allow Germany to carry out a overseas power project will already be outdated by the constant delays if they are finally put into service , as the weekly “ Time ” refers to .	-7.5852
The unhappy F125 freegate caused headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to take the ship and returned to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.4368
This was the first time the navy returned to a shipbuilding after the delivery .	-3.5190
The reason for the return of ships was little known ; German media referred to a number of critical “ software and hardware ” that would make the warship useless in combat operations .	-5.2474
Software defects were particularly important as the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class were served by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older Bremen-class freeways .	-5.5662
Also , it turned out that the ship has a significant overweight , which would limit performance and make future naval upgrades more difficult .	-6.0610
It is assumed that the 7.000-tonne “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II .	-3.1930
In addition to flawed hardware the whole project price shield - including crew training - will also be on the subject . .	-10.7467
Instead of the EUR 2.2 billion initially estimated , the costs now seem to have reached the declining level of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-4.6980
In the light of recent warnings , the problems of the latest catches are particularly significant for Germany ’ s maritime power to sink .	-6.5777
Earlier this year Hans-Peter Bartels admitted that the war fleet was actually “ the ships that were capable of being deployed ” by the German Parliament . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.3776

“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-3.4900
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good habitat .	-2.7387
But there is still a lot of unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other land helps us better understand what they need to live . ”	-5.0707
He stresses that it is important to check before maintenance work in buildings whether bats are there , according to which it is possible that a whole local population may be eliminated when the accidental destruction of a single sleeping place of motherboards of up to 400 females and boys .	-9.6070

Attorney Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for “ immaterial damage in the amount of gravity of injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . ”	-5.2688
The alleged incident is to have occurred in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.3868
According to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in the State of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga came back to the Player room after learning the skills of a nightclub , where they were .	-7.1944

Brexit : Britain would regret losing car manufacturers forever .	-2.1647
“ The UK would regret it for life if it lost its position as a world leader car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Greg Clark .	-4.5998
He added that it is ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily suspend production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Greater Britain left the EU without a deal .	-4.1921
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.6356
Japan ’ s car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-4.3343
The plant in Burnaston , which produces the Auris and Avenue for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-4.5263
“ If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , in my opinion it comes to our production stop ” , said Marvin Cooke , Chairman of the Board of Management at Toyota in Burna.	-5.1381
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.9222
BMW , for example , has already announced its intention to close its work in Oxford after Brexit for a month .	-2.2240
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-4.5245
Toyota production facilities are based on product-oriented manufacturing , i.e. parts delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the UK and the EU for special applications .	-5.4920
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there can be delays at the border which , according to industry angles , can lead to delivery shortages and partial scarcity .	-4.6176
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of inventory in his work in Derbyshire , the company said , and thus stopping production .	-3.6079
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “ exactly calibrated to avoid these checks at the border . ”	-3.6650
We need to have a deal ; we want the best deal that not only enables us to succeed today , we want to take this opportunity , ” he said the BBC Radio 4 programme today .	-5.2658
“ The reference not only of Toyota , but also of other manufacturers , is that it is absolutely essential that we be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.3591
Toyota did not provide information about how long the production stop might last , but warned that the increase in costs could suffer the factory 's competitiveness in the long term and eventually lose jobs .	-5.7544

Trump ’ s Rosenstein meeting may shift again , says the White House .	-3.2896
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with the Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could ' be postponed another week ' , as the fight for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , the White House said on Sunday .	-5.7973
Rosenstein oversees the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russian intervention in the elections , links between Trump and Russia and the possible obstruction of justice by the President .	-4.3116
Whether Trump will or will not fire the Deputy Attorney General , and thus endanger the independence of Müller , Washington has made a lot of headway for months .	-5.5536
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the wearing of a cable to sign talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th Constitutional Treaty .	-4.9583
Rosenstein refused to deliver an opinion .	-11.8960
But , last Monday , he came to the White House , while reports haggled that he was on the brink of resignation .	-3.6404
Instead , a meeting with Trump at the time in New York was announced for Thursday .	-2.5956
Trump said that he would not push Rosenstein to fire , but then the session was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate ’ s Justice Committee , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blsey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-6.2552
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh and continued to delay a full Senate title .	-5.3027
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-3.1714
After the Rosengein meeting , she said : " A date for this has not yet been fixed , it could be this week , I could see that I will go back another week , with all the other things going on with the Supreme Court .	-6.6248
But we will see and I always keep the press up-to-date . '	-2.9504
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since September 10 .	-2.1819
The guest , Chris Wallace , asked why .	-1.2744
Sanders said that the lack of briefings did not result in a divergence from television reporters , but she also said : ' I will not be against being in the gallery ' .	-6.3425
She then suggested that the direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.5695
" The President raises more questions and answers than any President said before him , " she said and added , without any evidence : " We have looked at these figures . "	-11.6033
Briefings are still going to take place , Sanders said , but the press should have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly the questions , that is , infinitely better than speaking with them .	-5.8248
We are trying to do a lot about this and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press debate if you can speak to the President of the United States themselves . ”	-4.7829
Trump answers questions periodically when he leaves the White House or takes part in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-3.3695
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-0.9885

He moved to the Stadium of Light this summer , after leaving St Mirren back to the Scottish first league last season .	-8.6464
“ I wanted to stand up for my country as a player . ”	-2.7303
I got a B-cap and that was ' s ' , said Ross to BBC Scottish Sportsound .	-3.0577

The former manager of Alloa Athletic said that he had no fear of going into the footsteps of this established manager in such a huge club .	-15.0951
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this association back to the Premier League ? "	-2.8520
With its structure and its institutions , this club clearly belongs to the Premier League , ” he said .	-3.8626
" It 's not an easy task to do it , but I would probably only see myself as a success if I can bring the club back there " .	-5.0423
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as a co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month magic for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-2.9080

The summer heat wave has increased revenues for British pubs being hit , but increased pressure on the dining chains .	-5.1732
Pub- and bar groups recorded a sales plus of 2.7 percent in July - the income in restaurants was at a gentle 4.8 % , as the numbers .	-7.0971
Peter Martin , from the CGA Corporate Advisory Council , which compiled the figures , said : " Constant sunshine and England took longer than expected participation in the world championships resulted in July following a similar pattern as last month of June , when the pub search rose by 2.8 % , only that restaurants were even more affected .	-8.2699
The decline in gas prices by 1.8 % in June only worsened in July .	-2.5458

Weather conditions and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the non-house market .	-4.2740
It is not surprising that the restaurant groups will continue to be under pressure , although a 4.8 % sales decline over the previous year will be particularly painful alongside ongoing cost pressure .	-5.9067
The long hot summer would not have been a bad time for food operators , and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we saw in August will provide the much-needed break .	-4.9637

Milk pumping , comparing mothers with cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-3.0327
A milk pumping company has led to controversial online discussions , owing to an advertisement comparing silent mothers to milkcows .	-5.8509
On the occasion of the introduction of the supposedly " world first silent and sustainable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic , inspired advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-6.4851
Four real mothers dance in a hairdresser in the middle of cows to a number with the following lyrics : " Yes , I melt me , but you see no cock " and " If you did not notice that there are no eurs , it 's my breasts " .	-7.0601
The slogan goes further : " Pump out , pump out , I feed the babies , pump out , pump out , pump off , I 'm melting my Ladies . "	-6.1130
However , the advertisement published on the company 's Facebook page has caused controversy online .	-3.6442
With 777,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers , many of whom say that it lighting the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-4.1720
" It is a very bad decision to throw cows for this product . "	-3.4064
As we also need to be pregnant and give birth to produce milk except that their babies are taken away within a few days of birth , one person wrote .	-11.3518
The Elvie Milky Pump fits unobtrusively into a silent H ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-4.9962
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-2.5799
But why should we not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.1492
Someone else added : ' This is an exterior work ' .	-3.9033
Others defended the advertising , including a woman who admitted that she found the song “ urkomian ” .	-4.6129
I think this is a great idea .	-1.6810
I would have received one if I had stumbled .	-2.9649
Through the pumping I felt like a cow .	-2.5519
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.3680
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-1.9444
Another commented : " This is a funny advertisement for mothers who are pumping ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feeling like " cows " .	-4.0703
This is not advertising that praise or judges the dairy industry . '	-8.8722
At the end of the video the group of women unveiled that they all trimmed with the depths of pumps in their sheets .	-11.6236
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women pumping milk say that they feel like cows .	-3.3562
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely silent , has no wires or hoses , and it doesn ’ t fit into a silent H , allowing women to move , keep their babies , and even to leave pumps .	-8.3197
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD commented on Mother : " The Elvie-Pump is such a revolutionary product that has earned a bold and provocative market launch .	-3.6431
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and milk cows , we wanted to focus the breast pumps and all its challenges , while demonstrating , in an entertaining and comparable way , the unbelievable sense of freedom that the new pump will bring with it .	-5.6072
This is not the first time that the Elvie pump comes into the headlines .	-2.2112

Hundreds of migratory children left for a tent camp on the Texas border .	-4.1056
The number of children imprisoned with a migration background has increased , even though the monthly border crossing has remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s tough rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-11.0311
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants , and fear that they will be expelled if they are committed to a child .	-4.5695
The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to be fingerprinting , and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-4.1105
Last week , Matthew Albright , a senior official within the Agency for Immigration and Custom Enforcement , reported that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-4.3939
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.3817
" Almost 80 % of the people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal outsiders .	-3.9071
" So we keep following these people , " said Alberence .	-4.7225
In order to process the requests for children faster , the officials introduced new rules that some of them are demanding to appear in court within a month after the imprisonment , and not after 60 days , which was the previous standard , so the staff of the accommodation .	-7.2684
Many will appear not personally , but via a video telephone conference to call for legal status at an immigration judge .	-4.7815
Those who do not qualify for discharge will soon be downgraded .	-3.0340
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they are fearful or depressed , which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-4.0910
Advocates have said that these concerns will be strengthened in a larger body like Tornillo , where evidence that a child is struggling is more likely to be overlooked because of its size .	-5.4038
They added that the move of children to the Zeltstadt , without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to pass away from friends , could worsen a trauma that many are already fighting .	-6.3377
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.9115
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouem also called upon Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-3.3244
Mouem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that the foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism , and ‘ they will deal with it accordingly ’ .	-5.3000
“ You must withdraw immediately , ” he said the House .	-2.9864
Mouem claimed to be close to the “ war on terror in Syria . ” More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , millions more have been displaced from their homes .	-4.4641
He said that Damascus will continue to fight this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-2.9891
The US has some 2,000 soldiers in Syria ; it is mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.5885
France has deployed more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.2113
On the question of refugees , Mouem said that the conditions for return were in order , and he accused “ of fueling some Western countries of irrational fear ” that led refugees to stay away .	-4.9796
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” says Mouem .	-2.1014
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.4554
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that only then can there be reconstruction aid for Syria if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition preceded an end to war .	-4.4109
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold , Idlib , made it possible to advance political talks .	-4.2445
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack from Russia ’ s supported Syrian troops on the province , where three million people live .	-3.5428
Mouem emphasized , however , that the agreement “ clear deadlines ” is in place , and he hopes that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra missile that “ shuts out . ”	-7.6535
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members in order to draft a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.9189
Mouem mentioned conditions for the participation of the Syrian government in the Committee : he said that the work of the body should be limited to the “ checking the articles out of the current constitution , ” and warned of interference .	-4.8998
Why Trump wins a Second Leadership	-3.3933
With this logic , Mr Trump would win the re-election of 2020 unless , as many liberal viewers probably hope , an administrative discharge procedure and scandals will put an end to his presidency prematurely .	-5.3310

It is not surprising that Pennsylvanias 17 is experiencing a flood of cash , thanks to a reorientation of a congressional district that two holders reached in a race for the same seat .	-4.8338
For this new district in the suburb of Pittsburg , the Democratic Conor Lamb – who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring .	-4.1701
Lamb is opposed to another incumbent , the Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which is clearly overlapping with the new 17 .	-4.4365
The cards were re-mixed after the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania decided in January that the old districts were rigorously manipulated in the sense of the Republican .	-10.7731
The race in the new 17 has triggered a campaign funding between the major party funding groups , the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee ( DCC ) and the National Republic Campaign Committee ( NRCC ) .	-5.1946
Lamb was a well-known name in Pennsylvania since he won special elections in Pennsylvania in March for the 18th Congress district in Pennsylvania with great victory .	-3.9385
This seat has been in republican hands for more than ten years , and President Donald Trump won 20 points in the district .	-3.0789

Representatives of the US Department of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw the American ambassador from El Salvador , the Dominican Republic , and Panama , in a statement at the beginning of this month , given the “ recent decisions that Taiwan no longer recognizes . ”	-4.9509
But sanctions have only been considered against El Salvador , which received an estimated $ 140 million in American aid in 2017 , including drunk control , development , and economic support .	-3.6442

During the internal meetings , North American and Central American officials are postponing a high-level conference focused on security and economic prosperity to pursue a similar meeting last year , considered a step forward in efforts to prevent immigrants into the United States .	-4.0071
But , by mid-September , leaders made it clear to the government that they wanted to continue the conference and effectively end the examination of sanctions against El Salvador .	-3.6724
It is now planned that Vice President Mike Pence turn to the conference scheduled for mid-October , in order to signal the significance of the Assembly ’ s government to leave the diplomats .	-6.1216

The next sabotage could be Trump ’ s possible obstruction to the judiciary , for which there is now very valid evidence in public files , Robert Mueller ’ s report .	-6.8927
Mr Mueller also mentions his inquiries as to whether Trump ’ s campaign with Russia was conspicuous in his attack on our elections .	-5.0614
If the majority of Congress changes , Trump will have to be accountable to this body if he equips himself for the new election campaign , and perhaps he will be responsible for a court with his party friends .	-13.1381
