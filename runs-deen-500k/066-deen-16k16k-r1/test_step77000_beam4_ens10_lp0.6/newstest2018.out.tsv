Everyone who had to stand up for it because the auto-Navi showed a green meadow instead of a bypass .	-5.3111
The historical maps of the digital Bayern-Atlass , an offer of the Geoportas Bayern of the state government , are far from current - but that is precisely why very interesting .	-7.8064
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-1.6707
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed in the distribution area of the Munich property since the 19th century .	-5.2751
The Bayern-Atlas digital flicker epoch is one that cannot be seen as such .	-5.9412
In the big card of intent , more detailed maps were created for cities and municipalities , so-called pri.	-7.0429
According to the Bavarian surveying administration between 1810 and 1864 , this was the first measuring of Bavaria .	-6.2424
Your customer : Napoleon .	-0.7430
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War .	-3.0173
Napoleon wanted to see the occupied country and commissioned a topographical inclusion of Bavaria , of course for military purposes .	-4.4078
Even though the French troops eventually departed with the peace of Lunéville on February 9 , 1801 , today ’ s neighbors created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card .	-5.0871
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to advance the project , founded the " Topographic Bureau " and thus the Bayerische Measuring Administration .	-5.4603
The Annual Position Blade for Munich dates back to 1856 and is on the website of the Bavarian National Library .	-4.4822
The Alter / Today comparison is most impressive in the state capital .	-4.9321
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.6808
An example of this is subsending , which is still relatively isolated on the map of 1856 .	-4.5437
Sendling was inaugurated 21 years after the card was created in 1877 , when Munich 's district was founded .	-5.1067
Today , it is located in the middle of the city .	-3.6531
The houses of Subsendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße , which was named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser , a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian peasant against Austria in 1705 .	-6.4284
Where the West Park is today , there are no fields - at first glance : with the zooming , a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten numered fluffs from the so-called " taking " , from which the property tax was derived .	-8.9065
Small plots no longer show farmers there - but small gardeners of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-5.0476
A large green area is situated north of Subsendling .	-2.8312
Theresienwiese , since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest , was still a meadow in the 19th century - not concrete plains .	-4.6275
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.2586
In the Urposition Blade , in the area of the present district of Au-Haidhausen you can read not only the street name " am Gasteig " or the hill " On the Lübten " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-7.2327
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstrasse people were once locked up with orphans .	-5.2680
In 1858 / 59 the Münchner Kreisch-Irrenzurät " was born on the Auer L. "	-6.5335
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden directed the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II .	-4.1746
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the puppets of the so-called Irren .	-4.8137
He also banned the staff from using violence against the insects , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Haidhausen , who worked for an exhibition with the Anstalt .	-5.9311
For 280 patients it was first place , later it was extended to 500 places .	-5.2257
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreissenstalt in Ha 1905 .	-6.1498
Since 2006 , Isar Amper-Klinikum München-Ost has been located there , one of Germany 's largest psychiatric .	-4.6103
The former Auer Anstalt area now faces young people in the Munich Salesianun .	-4.5538
The order bought the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth house with training facilities .	-3.5703
West lies the football pitch of TSV München East , East Houses from the 1980s .	-3.3970
In 2015 , the “ Casa Don Bosco ” children ’ s house was built , an architectural parlance of the Iron origin , which had been destroyed by bombardments during World War II .	-7.0536
The Marienplatz was listed as " Main Square " in 1856 , which was the " Kaufinger gasse " .	-5.4047
A decisive change was made in the heart of Munich as well .	-3.3009
Allied bombs risk many holes in the city centre in December 1944 .	-3.3440
A big one stayed today - at the Marienhof .	-3.7382
The English Institute , Small Business Houses and a Middle Ages chapel were once located at the Marienhof , where the preliminary works are carried out on 5 April 2017 of the column stich for the second S-Bahn railway line .	-13.3106
The old Munich card can be compared with today 's air picture - and fill the hole at the Marienhof .	-5.3474
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Mis.	-3.0298
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the State .	-4.1316
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for Afro-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay special attention to travel through the state and to make extreme prudence , as a number of questionable , racial events take place throughout the state and be recorded here , " says in the opinion of the group .	-8.3124
A recently adopted law by Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to gain acts of discrimination , as well as the law enforcement authorities of the state , which target minorities disproportionately , led the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP .	-5.4534
" They have violations of civil rights that people pass .	-3.0512
They are held for their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-2.8625
" We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . "	-2.8147
It is the first such warning that the organization issued for a state in the US .	-2.9180
The group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.7347
Sanders died at the beginning of the year in questionable circumstances , after he had no more gasoline during his trip through the state and was detained by the police of Missouri without accusing any crime .	-5.3377
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Prosecutor of State of Missouri , which shows that black drivers are more often held than white in the state .	-5.4089
" The recommendation is that people are aware and their families , friends and staff inform about what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-3.2730
" People need to be prepared whether to bring about bailouts or to let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-5.5882
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s Hassanitary Report , which classify the state in relation to the number of such injuries to the 16 ranking of the country .	-5.5397
Warning travel is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-3.8959
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) had issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States adopted immigration laws , committing local law enforcement agencies to arrest people because of offences , which , according to ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.6158
Travel warnings are usually issued by the foreign ministry for other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure to respond to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.6156
Weid project is elementary	-3.5716
The Fischer bacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-3.1783
Peter Weil and Kordula Kovac have given themselves an image on the ground .	-4.7685
At the rights grabbenhof of the Schöndemann family , representatives of the fishing village of CDU met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-6.0016
Markus Schndemann first provided insights into his plant , which manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , provides 40 milk cows and as many young animals and houses five apartments holiday guests .	-6.8658
The " Black Forest Milk " is for him the alternative route for the milk of his cows , Schwendemann .	-4.8193
On the table of the guests is only regional .	-5.5449
As he is also the BLHV-Chairman of Fischerbach , he called the Weiezau project a " elementary important " .	-5.5918
I cannot make the most of these steep areas .	-3.0893
Green land care for a lot of work , much needs to be done with the engine sense .	-5.6594
" We have to fight with the conditions and with the topography , " said Schöndemann .	-5.3774
In 2003 he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not manage a bio-plant .	-4.2758
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipalities have recognized the importance of the Weidau project and is happy about Leather Promotion . "	-5.6547
Farmers would have to be supported at the expense of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare .	-3.1751
It is hoped that this will allow the planting of land to continue for a long time .	-5.3822
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry out their business " , the mayor stressed .	-4.9890
Farmers are often in the criticism because of support .	-3.4228
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of 11 participants were enrolled over the promotion of wheat .	-11.4252
The area of the book is 40 hectares , which cannot be listed by at least 2023 .	-5.6746
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was increased by Leader , a quarter was the municipality of Fischerbach .	-4.9630
As a result , farmers have fallen below EUR 12 610 , which they have had to invest in 16.2 km of pasture .	-4.5439
" The big advantage is the longevity of the fences , " explained Swendemann .	-2.9659
Kordula Kovac emphasized : " You do a good job without farmers and land women doing it not " .	-4.6471
Peter Weiß also said : " Here the best food is produced " .	-3.7987
The Landscape Centre ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg provides government support for Weizenäinen .	-5.1350
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.9444
The existence of a pumping machine called the LPR is a prerequisite .	-12.8884
Furthermore , the area to be inserted must not be insignificant ( gain more than 35 % ) and must thus be threatened by afforestation .	-6.5577
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunproject 2018 , the application is currently running by eight participants with 24 parcels , who would like to build almost 16 km of fence .	-6.7160
The area of entertainment is 35 hectares and costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-4.8270
Is nothing more sacred ?	-1.1914
Now is the Trump White House adopting the Statue of Liberty .	-3.2312
The safest sign of a regime change is to start attacking statues .	-1.8062
Americans appreciate this as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-5.3104
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president ’ s proposals for drastic restrictions on legal immigration with the status of freedom .	-11.7777
To remain fair Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.6440
A horde of boatsmen and Liberty imitators would have praised him if he had done so .	-4.0711
But it took on its importance , and in particular the importance it was attributed to it , when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the memorial . .	-17.1290
As a Miller Acosta , " I don 't want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-5.3077
The poem to which you refer , which was later added , is not part of the original state of freedom ' .	-3.5366
Miller is factually right , but as he himself put it , it is not really a matter of history .	-3.1990
It is about the contemporary resonance of Lazarus 's mourning words , the only one in which a state does not just invite any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your mothers , your poor , your poor , / your besieged masses who yearn to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your coasts " .	-7.5801
There was never a time when the " dark waste " was better on our screens .	-3.9001
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-3.1912
This conflict over the importance of statue is part of a broader political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict over America 's importance .	-3.5076
Lazarus - and their friends who urged to place their words at the base after their death - knew very well that they were doing a highly political act .	-4.4380
The sculpture was supposed to show the links between French and American Republicans , by describing the female concealment of freedom in a classic form .	-6.1940
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she got a voice .	-3.2002
And she gives herself another name : mother of the exiles .	-2.7166
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.7807
And , just as Lazarus changed the meaning of statue , people on the right have long wanted to change it .	-4.0960
The grand barrel of Rush Limbah , a kind of John of the Tauern for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the state of freedom would not invite anyone , but rather be an early neoconservant bringing the American flame to the world around : " Lady Liberty is going ahead .	-7.9114
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .	-2.3053
The torch should not be on the road to the United States ' .	-9.9798
Limbah is a bit unusual here .	-4.6182
The importance of statue is absolutely a question of the point of view .	-2.9017
Lazarus 's great phantasological act was to see them as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often dreadful trips to the decks of ships .	-14.7105
It is really about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and improving their lives .	-3.3272
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the will they must hear .	-2.6692
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to acknowledge .	-3.0772
Their torch should not fail , but should ignite the hatred that is their only source of power .	-4.8019
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the UK team	-8.6696
Eilidh Doyle reminds us of a time when only two Scots were part of the UK team .	-10.0789
The British Leichtathletic Director , Neil Black , says that the 16-year-old Scottish quota in the World Championships ' will make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-6.6417
A record number of Scotch athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.8922
Black believes that ' something special developed in Scotland ' and the British athletics must learn something from it .	-5.4912
" We welcome it and we try to understand it and we will continue until we find it , " said Black .	-2.5975
" I am talking to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.9747
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.3146
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-3.0393
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.5982
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.7670
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal starters , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team captain .	-4.8138
" Eilidh is fairly modest .	-1.5422
Her captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.2389
" A number of athletes , no matter if they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-3.8662
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh brought in , of course , were great . '	-11.0416
The Commonwealth Silver Medal Winner , who will take part in the 400-m hurdles at their fifth World Championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.7927
Scotland ’ s highest total of athletes in the World Cup has been seven who were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.9986
Muir 's medium-run run run along this road and established five British and two European records last year .	-4.9474
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runs .	-3.7591
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 m , is another Scot to watch after a great season that won the British team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.0213
Doyle is reminiscent of her first world championships , as the only other Scot in the Lee McConnell team was .	-8.4575
The captain of the team says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her fellow countrymen will not only belong to the team , but in some cases also become involved in the medals and finals .	-5.3194
" The special feature of being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so that it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me makes it a very special thing for me " she added .	-5.0721
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-2.2368
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.8070
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to increase on podia .	-3.7718
As regards my speech as captain ?	-2.0719
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.6965
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a World Cup in Europe .	-4.6562
So it is really important to rely on this support and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.2769
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there ' .	-4.4691
Block critics about Facebook : Don ’ t worry about a public office if you don ’ t compete with voters .	-5.3200
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-2.0124
The Americans loved George Washington , but it did not last long until the newspapers suggested him for anything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-4.2736
He was safe in criticizing . .	-9.2591
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.2712
After all , in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupid we , like sheep , are going to slaughter ' .	-4.6386
That brings me to Maryland , Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.3614
Hogans employees blocked the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .	-3.4046
The American Civil Liberties Union was therefore concealing it at the beginning of this week .	-4.5926
The governor ’ s staff dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online commentary was full of a backlash with “ Na , and ? ” .	-3.9590
" It is only Facebook , " many people said .	-1.7419
But it is important .	-0.9961
And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan .	-3.0433
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is remarkably popular .	-2.2119
He has the second highest possible approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.7065
Hogan is no reactionary hit head .	-2.8805
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict compliance with the principles .	-3.7462
He was also very clever in using Facebook as primary means to connect with his voters and playfully debase his hair head after chemotherapy on his side .	-5.3333
That is why the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - who is a public forum known as official , and who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.3969
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than moderation .	-3.4621
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hassle filled people who swinging online .	-4.8826
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-2.5718
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a parish , no trolls .	-4.0345
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-2.2846
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith .	-2.0204
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-11.2452
" I commented courtesy that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the context of the message " The Post " .	-3.9224
" I also do not appreciate this idea when a number of people are taking a position on the same subject , then some people are disregarded rather than a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected ' .	-7.2767
What the governor ’ s staff called a “ concentrated Spam attack ” would probably call others “ language . ”	-5.3779
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.4992
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same had been done , that employees were sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles , or to detain and silence demonstrators .	-5.2132
But that is exactly what happens digitally .	-2.4725
Hogan is not the first public officials to be criticised for his impediment to Facebook and other social media .	-4.1109
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter enabled .	-2.9068
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-2.0097
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to the U.S. district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she admitted a constituent of their Facebook page .	-5.6849
And in Kentucky , governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also visited ACLU for its use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.7874
This should not be so difficult .	-2.3382
At the time of Washington , the era of affordable ports had a similar effect to the Internet .	-2.8786
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous posters proposed leadership .	-3.5304
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.4872
The people who used pseudonyms such as " Juranicola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters of newspapers that established Washington 's decisions .	-4.2643
petitions , which criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity , Trade and shipping with Great Britain , overwhelmed his position , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .	-4.6747
But he did not silence it .	-1.5014
Freedom of expression , disagreements and discourse are the basis of our nation .	-3.7347
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.3507
Ronan Rafferty hopes for home comfort in the Renaissance Club .	-1.7954
Former European No. 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for domestic comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will host the 25th edition of the Scottish Senior Open .	-4.5226

He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of his performance here .	-2.1249
This is a great showcase for this course ' .	-2.3788
The Englishman Eales is looking forward to defending a championship for the first time , despite winning his 32-year career at both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .	-4.3091
" This really feels special , " said the player heated in Southport .	-2.8783
" I have not been able to defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the programme in the year after I won it .	-3.3750
Back to this part of the world is magical .	-1.0659
It is a wonderful place to play golf .	-1.8534
The memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year .	-3.5704
It was a very special time and one that we will always appreciate . '	-2.2736
Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , is returning to the action on his home soil .	-4.3869
This event will be its first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-1.9184
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-3.5544
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this extra pressure .	-2.6211
I really enjoyed playing it again and I played a solid golf .	-1.5978
I am pleased with what has happened . '	-3.3503
With the Trio in the field are the former Masters Sieger Ian Woosname and Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .	-4.4354

The entrance is free of charge , the parking costs <unk> 5 per car with an advertisement and <unk> 10 per car with two or more occupants .	-4.5874
All proceeds go to Prostate Cancer UK .	-2.1066
Less lung cart through passive smoking .	-2.6969
Over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .	-2.4858
Researchers from the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) are received in a study .	-4.1915
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are caused by passive smoking , " said Professor Heiko Becher .	-3.5319
As a comparison , he drew his own study on this issue in 1994 .	-3.9780
At that time there were 400 lung cancer cases due to passive smoking in Germany .	-2.9308
The new investigation is published in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-2.1671
Home-to-city connections are a very complex one .	-5.1465
The building works at the Villinger Strasse are in full swing and " are somewhat in time " , says the head of the construction house Fred Heinze .	-5.1316
In the area of the houses , the situation is more complicated than expected , as there is a lot of hidden hidden underground which is not included in the plans .	-7.2912
Traffic , which always prevents construction work , is a major problem for the Stumpp project .	-7.0890
" The ignorance of drivers in front of red amples and lockers is already enormous , " explains Heinze .	-5.0602
The road was closed and only the regular buses were allowed to go through .	-4.2324
Angelo Caruso , Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz from the company Stumpp have been busy working on the bridge for weeks .	-9.7699

Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the leader of the Kego Koto Quarter of Enaratali , saw the threatening danger and called for rest and called for the crowd to return home .	-6.0042

Some were in the 90s and early 2000 ’ s .	-1.7861
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these violations , but there are processes that need to be broken , " he said .	-4.0490
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke to TIME on 5 June and said he did not have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.7543
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-1.7133
Wiranto , accused of the UN for " crimes against humanity " , which claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor 's bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua had already been settled , including the Paniai event .	-5.2752

" I hid myself two days in my house . "	-2.7695
The Deiyai Parliament has called on the officers to account and to withdraw the mobile police Brigade from the area .	-4.3888
Paniai was always an unrest for the Indonesian government .	-2.8634
The lack of sensible development strengthens the discontent of tribal members Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the green highlands of Papua .	-4.6650
Many of them joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the rights of the Papua by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.6436
Some of the top OP leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudes Kogoya .	-2.7483
In response to this , thousands of people have been arrested in Paniai in recent years and arbitrarily detained , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-4.0408
Some people never dive again .	-1.3853
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as a " tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.5601

" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money " , says John Gobai , Chairman of the Paniai tribal Council .	-3.7392
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.9858
Furthermore , restrictions on reporting by international media remain tense .	-2.1312
Earlier this year , French journalists were deported Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , even though they were given rare permission to film .	-3.8347
According to Phelim Kine , the deputy Asia-Director of Human Rights Watch , the pledges of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been implemented .	-4.5511
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia ’ s most ruthless eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-4.2933
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to the immediate neighbours of Papuas .	-4.6157
In March , six Pacific States - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate ' various and widespread infringements ' in Papua , including the Panii Shia foundry .	-4.2360

Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua says that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-3.1137
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the leader of the tribal council .	-5.0774
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor educational and health care services .	-3.6139
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , consider their voice for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must pay back .	-3.9916
" You don 't need a money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.6136
Despite the threats and intimidations , Paniai 's families led to a final symbolic act of the Trotze : the suffering of a victim was buried on a site close to the police and the military station .	-5.5554

Fire captures the ' Torch ' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time .	-2.9408
A fire took place on Friday in one of the world ’ s highest residences in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 337 m high 79-storey buildings .	-4.9877
It is the second fire which in just two years sweeps through the high house , which is usually called the Torch Tower .	-5.5298
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.4835
" We slept and we stood up for fire alarm and cries of the people .	-3.9787
We drowned the stairway and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor " , told a resident who called his name as George angab , Reuters .	-5.2889
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire-fighting units were erasing fire at 4.00 a.m. local time ( 00.00 a.m. GMT ) and bolstered the building .	-12.1917
The government said that they are working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-2.7399
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in high-rise areas around the world .	-3.4185
In 2015 , an investigation by the Torch building management revealed that most of the damage came from the coating , the external knife to decoration or isolation .	-7.3014
In the UK , the police said that they believe that the system of plates for isolation and clothing on the London Grenfell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died .	-5.9980
No Davis Cup reform : Next Be Of Five	-7.2491
The president of the International Tennis Federation ( ITF ) has passed through the General Assembly with his large Davis-Cup coup .	-4.6480
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City , the proposal for this sports revolutionary proposal to play Davis Cup individuals only on two winning rates was not very much supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-6.2424
This is often very long , but it is also why very esteemed five-sale classics remain true to the traditional contest .	-8.8455
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of reform , the objective of ITF-President David Haggerty was therefore only slightly missing .	-4.3868
" We respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our membership did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.8433
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.8211
We will continue to work to improve the candidates .	-1.8197

More than 1 of 5 US travellers brings prohibited objects to the plane , there is a poll out .	-4.2666
One air passenger poll found that more than 20 % deliberately or unwittingly smuggled prohibited items to the US Transport Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 % of the aircraft , while accidentally carrying prohibited knights or other items .	-7.3822
Less than 1 % claimed they had discovered late that they were irrelevant to gun weapons , ammunition , or explosive .	-4.2897
The survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers do not respect the rules .	-4.5955
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were Millennium , compared to less than 15 % , the members of the generation X .	-5.7423
The most common items intentionally have been scanned by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-4.6609
More than 3 % gave to knowingly carry items with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs to the plane .	-6.2563
The company said that it interviewed travellers across the country to find out how many accidental smuggling goods had brought through airport security and how many would have done it intentionally .	-5.4138
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggling , knowingly or unwittingly , by safety were those who fly most often .	-5.6065
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are rather complicated and confusing .	-2.3377
People are often unsure what liquids they can take or how much of them .	-3.3673
So it is no surprise that the greatest amount of what TSA has confiscated are liquids .	-5.5005
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as jewelry .	-3.5911
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.9664
Elon Musk makes no difference : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders .	-2.9176
Electro-thousand sassa Elon Musk is happy to give with the huge number of preliminary performances for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-10.7431
In doing so , he has signed up to now that a part of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-11.1339
In addition to the increasingly triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla ’ s head , Elon Musk , has for the first time betrayed a different , less glorious number : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-7.0895
In recent months , muscles have often faced more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , the delivery of which is just beginning .	-7.0336
Musk now admits : from a total of 518,000 reserved spaces 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-5.8762
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that there are only non-binding reservations .	-3.7541
In case of cancellation Tesla will pay the EUR 1000 ( in the US $ 1000 and in the United Kingdom 1000 Pounds ) " reservation payment " completely .	-6.4470
Currently 455,000 such unbinding reservations are available , muscles are admitted in a conference with analysts .	-4.1861
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling so far approximately 12 % of all orders could be a problem .	-4.9723
Its argument : the challenge facing ambitious growth targets is not demand , but the production side .	-4.1525
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.2003
2018 - all models taken together - should be 500,000 , 2020 one million .	-3.3076
The demand for this is obvious .	-2.5940
There are currently 1800 reservations per day according to musk .	-3.9435
If you order a " Model 3 " today , you can expect extradition in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its nagel new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without any major interruptions to maximal utilisation .	-7.5055
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.1371
If , however , it is to be delayed , the insolvency of making reservations on the problem of Tesla could become .	-6.7379
After all , the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running in droves .	-4.0546
EPA leader Pruitt is retreating because of the Obama Era rules on reducing emissions .	-3.3455
A day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the chief of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of polluting atmospheric pollutants .	-5.1257
Pruitt presented change when his agency turned out to the needs of government environmental authorities more responsive than before .	-4.8898
He did not mention the case that had been lodged against him in a federal court of occupation .	-4.3702
It is a deadline for states operating on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for boring ozone .	-3.7447
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth " .	-3.7029
Pruitt , who was prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental legislation .	-3.2946
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that have resisted the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry .	-3.7291
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal backlash for the Pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda .	-3.7802
Last month , a federal court in Washington ruled that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that committed oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-5.0607
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his U-turn in ozone standards would simply strengthen EPAs ’ willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.4565
" Under previous administrations , the EPAs often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be prosecuted by activists groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-6.0719
" We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.6865
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously ' .	-2.3992
However , the EPA 's opinion said that Pruitt will eventually use its " competence to delay and all other powers legally available " to ensure that the rules " are based on a solid policy and the best available information " .	-5.2671
Congressional Republicans urge a broader recast of ozone rules .	-2.4112
A draft law approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.1310
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.4116
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneider , who led the coalition of states that sued EPAs this week , said the Group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.3325
" The reversal of the EPA - after our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New York and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities " said Schneiderman .	-5.9685

Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique local gem " .	-3.4120
In 1267 the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the Württemberg log of documents : Graf Hermann von Sulz sold " the mountain with the following parish church to Tumlingen and the Vogbau " to Magister Eberhard of Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .	-14.7993
According to the letter , on the Tumlinger Berg , other than the former parish church , there was also a statue house , which was a church or cartridge law and not vice versa .	-7.9712
So it was people who lived there too .	-2.5041

The new bell then killed 1692 for the first time , but later it had to be handed over in the Second World War in 1942 .	-5.2636
In the Thirty Years War ( 1616 to 1648 ) the window panes were inserted and the bell parts were stolen .	-4.3701
It was a very nice hotel .	-5.9269
In 1796 , French troops were deployed near the church .	-2.6443

Association wants to check approval of windmills .	-4.1265
" Boisheim wears itself " does not see a legal condition for the construction and has therefore appealed to the Landcouncil .	-5.0332
The Boisheim association has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the establishment of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim net .	-4.4429
It is not illegal .	-3.0921
The Association argues that at the time of authorization on 30 December 2016 in Boisheimer 's net , wind power plants could not have been approved , because at the time in fourteen there was only a wind force concentration zone at the Schnalmtal urban limit .	-8.1161
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind power plants are basically possible , but at the same time the concentration zone also prevents the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-6.7196
Such zones should prevent a " paralysis " of the landscape .	-3.8604
The city of Viersen , a few days ago , had decided , by amending the land exploration plan , a second wind turbine area in the Boisheimer Nette - which had not approved the district government of Düsseldorf , because of a form error .	-8.4885
" Due to the lack of a planning legal requirement , the certificate granted is still unlawful and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim defends itself " .	-6.1446
The current state of affairs : the town council has once again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette before the summer break ; the district government is still authorized .	-6.9647
Erkens : " This is where the granting of authorization for the construction of wind power plants is excluded from the planning law " .	-6.6402
The circle confirms the entrance to the invitation .	-1.6326
" The corresponding letters have been received at the circle of Viersen since last week , " a speaker said .	-4.7867
It is poisonous to look into the matter again .	-4.6202
However , they are not likely to lead to a halt to the procedure .	-2.9367
In view of ongoing procedures at the administrative court , the district on Thursday did not want to comment on the content of the arguments of the Boisheim association .	-5.6431
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four windmills per 200 metres in an area on the Boisheimer Net .	-5.1757
Already last year , the company in which the city was mediately involved had closed packing contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of land .	-6.3190
With the construction of the four wind power plants , electricity needs can be covered by about 11 400 households - equivalent to about a fifth of the electricity needs of all four households .	-6.5861
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.7707
Last summer , Viersens Town Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind power plants at the Linnich Windpark at Aachen , as well as participation in a wind power plant in <unk>bak-Palenberg in the province of Heinsberg .	-6.5916

City and traders are planning ' home shops ' weekends .	-3.3195
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the centre of September .	-5.4769
The Gewerbeverein and the Municipality want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to entice the inhabitants to the shopping centre .	-5.1282
As the chairman of the Gewerbeverein , Christian King , announced , the ' home shop ' weekend is intended to raise the awareness of the offers offered by our own city outside the usual supermarket .	-7.6721
Thus , plans are a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .	-3.4397
Moreover , domestic companies should present themselves with their training places .	-3.2825
In addition , the shops of the city centre are to invite you to the “ Mitternachts-” shop . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.2547
Not only are the destinations destinations of the city and the nearby region .	-6.4464
In preparation , advertisers are on the radio , an Internet video and printed beutles pointing out at the Action weekend , Christian King .	-5.6447
The municipal administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce and Industry .	-3.1063
This makes the Gewerbeverein and the city go into another stage of the project " Attractive downtown " .	-3.8836
These include new offers , such as the first " Active Day " to the Brunnenstein and sold Sunday , talks with all tradesmen and hosts to get them active participation .	-6.5452
Also attractive offers for Saturday and departure of parking fees on that day are part of the concept .	-3.5887
In addition , customer potential should be re-opened or opened again .	-4.0045
They include guests and tourists .	-3.2183
But many locals would also have lost the city centre when it comes to shopping .	-4.9355
In the end , everyone would have to help to stimulate the city centre - to rent , to businesses all over the city and clubs .	-6.7777
King said in the spring that he had to overcome the leatharmy with a network that had spread .	-7.7072
Birgit Streich , director of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , said that five Thuringian cities would be participating in the nationwide third " home-shop " day .	-6.6697
Besides Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleierode .	-3.3825
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and place more emphasis on the common good of our cities ' .	-4.6613
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his or her direct environment with his purchasing behaviour .	-6.0403

Transcription of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-3.0764
On 27 January , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump urged to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.5513
The US President kicked him out because he publicly denounced the wall , saying , ' You cannot tell the press ' .	-5.3013
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the US ’ s southern border , and swore to pay Mexico for the project .	-3.1457
He also published a transcription of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turbull and revealed a tense exchange .	-3.4890
Mr Trump said Mr. Turbull that a trade for the US would make refugees emigrated to Australia " laughable " , " mies " and " stupid " , and that the insistence on the trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a " depot " after proposing a ban on relocating refugees to the US .	-14.8696
Mr Trump put an end to the call , having told Mr Turnbull , ' that is the unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.6004
Moores Ford Massacre : Activists are reintroducing racist lyncha as a call for justice .	-4.0076
A 1948-er Ford Mercury travelled through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and called on the Moore Ford Bridge .	-4.7923
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-4.2564
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle attack - took a long train on his cigarette and looked at the wind guard .	-6.1589
In the evening , the insects flooded in fear .	-4.7859
" We want these n -- r Roger ! " the man broke .	-3.4332
" Get him out of the car ! "	-1.5462
Shripe torn the silence as a young black man was torn away from the front-passenger seat .	-3.5170
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is only a remnant .	-4.3690
But if a bypass is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the public has experienced very real sigh .	-6.9009
Since 2005 , civil rights activists come back to Moore 's Ford Bridge to emulate the night in which two black pairs - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were praised by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.6899
Nobody was ever prosecuted for murder .	-2.1774
" It is truly incomprehensible that in all these years no one person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , even though we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps in organising the presentation .	-5.5773
" It is a dirty coat on a history , but it is a burden for our souls " .	-3.8783
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of Georgia and a life of civil rights defenders .	-3.8264
For him , the submission serves as a dramatic call for action and constitutes an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.4226
" We want criminal prosecution , we want an end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we must have justice , " he said .	-3.5453
" We cannot achieve healing and reconciliation until we receive justice " .	-3.7532
A legal expert puts a leafy on the sufferings of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946 .	-7.5835
According to FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 Monroe men and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lyng process .	-4.4222
But none has ever been charged .	-1.9988
Although suspects have been at large for decades , citizens ’ rights say that double motivation for Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .	-5.0392
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court made it possible for the first time to cast their votes in the preelection campaign in the summer .	-3.9137
About at the same time as the election , according to the FBI of Black Farmpätter Roger Malcom , a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a battle , allegedly because of a woman .	-5.2093
Brooks said that the smell in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom 's wife Dorothy and that the baby she had was not from her husband .	-4.4750
On July 25 , 1946 Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid 600 dollars to free Malcom from prison , said the FBI .	-3.1355
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousin Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.0128
But when they went out of prison and came closer to Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-4.5757
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the killings , " concludes a FBI report .	-2.7880
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the killings , eliminated evidence and distorted the identity of witnesses . "	-4.7912
Brooks worsen it even more concise .	-2.1535
" It was an electoral court massacre , " he said .	-2.3373
" You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you register and if you vote , you will pass that here . "	-3.9264
For almost a decade Cassandra Greene has led the annual rendition of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch-Morde .	-3.6453
Their presentation is illustrious , evolving and is based on a kind of deep racism , many of which would like to believe that he no longer exists in America .	-5.6501
It is hard to see and look even more difficult , but Greene said that this is the point .	-3.5641
" We don 't want to talk about the lynch , because we are then faced with its firmness in all of us , " she said .	-4.5232
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.4956
The samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - took part in a space and heard Greene about the track .	-5.7332
Wade Marbaugh is here Greene Co-director .	-3.2393
He has played the role of head clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-2.8125
" I feel dirty because I am not so " , Marbaugh said .	-2.6621
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times " .	-2.3462
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , have their lines .	-3.5283
The play begins with Malcom , who is hiding and squeezing Hester , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.8645
" I said n -- he , disappear from my property ! "	-2.0720
Rascona hurts the fire .	-2.8478
There is a pause .	-0.8080
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) will break out in terrain .	-4.6436
Greene laugh the loudest .	-2.3758
" What ? ! " , Rascona asked .	-1.2074
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.9867
Was I too harsh ?	-1.1011
" No " , said Greene , still ticking .	-3.2330
" I simply do not think white people at the time ' n -- he said ' .	-3.3039
" But " , one of the other black actors scored .	-2.6396
" You just have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-3.1045
And that is where energy shifts , a feeling of friendship replaces the unease .	-3.2684
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-2.6147
The scene begins again .	-1.7239
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it loud and forcefully .	-2.7650
No one is absolutely laughing .	-2.8851
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-1.7440
There are castles , shots and then silence .	-2.9223
A woman with a sense of sorrow is over the bodies of the actors and performs cheap Holidays of mourning praise " Strange Fruit " .	-5.0768
Your vote breaks at each second word .	-2.3182
About one hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears out of sight .	-4.8193
The audience is almost equally divided between black and white .	-1.9502
A pair is from Ithaca , New York , excited to see the performance , many just come to the street .	-3.1003
They have all experienced Georgias ’ depressing humidity for almost eight hours when Brooks leads them on a pilgrimage trip to the tombs of Malcom and Dorseys . .	-5.9128
To this point , the killings have remained an anecdote , but now , when one stands on the same land where the lynch killings took place , the air feels divided .	-4.8698
When ending the last notes of the song , Greene invites the lot to come closer and instill the body .	-4.9615
Children hook at their heads , register the falsified blood and the silent body and flee each other .	-4.1932
" You are not really dead " , mumbles a little boy as he would remember .	-3.8262
After a few minutes thanks Greene the lot - and suddenly it is over .	-1.9705
The actors throw away the lynchpiece and wipe their tears .	-3.1836
Bradshaw outline Marbaugh , the man in move who played the clan member .	-3.9322
Nick Rascona secures two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their poor , the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him .	-5.5199
" It is okay " , one of women flexes .	-2.7947
" We know that this is not your heart .	-1.5968
You did that for one reason . '	-2.0407
Later the public will meet with the actors for dinner .	-3.8630
At a table a white pair of Atlanta stimulates the reproduction with a black pair that you have just met .	-4.8794
Denise Duplinski fought to find words which feeling left the performance .	-2.6537
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , " she said .	-3.5444
" What really does with me makes me believe that the lynch still goes on , " she added , " today is only called a police officer . "	-5.6850
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof holds at his table , eating and recalling civil rights .	-4.5415
He said he started to plan the show next year .	-2.6116
" The preparation is in a way inspiring , because it describes the horrors of what we have inherited , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.1212
" It is like we do not learn anything from it , then it can happen again .	-2.8618
Whoever does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat it ' .	-3.9968
The Wagnerians promised Goddess Dawn in Bayreuth	-3.9339
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf relies on a colorful frivole inscription against a gigantic , six-fold backdrop .	-6.3457
The turning stage ( designed by Aleksanddar Denic ) displays a shabby street corner , including Moorest and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " Plaste and Elaste " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-7.8453
Prior to that , an open Mercedes-Oldtimer , in which the rheiners position themselves as rock girls , or alternatively a Isetta .	-6.8853

Great applause exists for the festival master , which is shown on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in a more carefree dressing .	-7.6321
The performance of Frank Castorf and his director had been awaited with excitement .	-4.7332
Had he still had a full arrow in 2013 , five years later , there were great jewels in which the fractured " buh " ruple went down .	-8.3045
Katharina Wagner will have been pleased about this .	-3.2212
" It was noticed that the audience met with the " ring " in a way , " she said shortly before the performance of dpa .	-4.8465
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf , but it also grew an understanding of its view .	-3.7071

The US Environmental Protection Agency has ruled to delay a regulation of Obama ’ s administration , whereby states are obliged to contain smog-related emissions , one day after 15 states were responsible for taking action .	-6.8685
The EPAs late on Wednesday announced the decision to press the so-called ' Ozone rules in 2015 ' and said that it is showing the agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-4.8997
" We believe in dialogue with and in response to our state partners " , EPA leader Scott Pruitt said in a statement .	-3.4737
Pruitt announced in June the intention of the EPAs to delay the ozone provisions - in which emissions of pollutants are to be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made to comply with stricter air quality standards - by one year until October 2018 .	-5.0625
A group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , appealed on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-2.8750
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reverse a wide range of environmental constraints imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump is supposed to boost economic growth .	-4.0979
Efforts have , however , triggered the setback of the democrats and nature protection groups that are concerned about the impact of greater emissions on public health .	-5.2731
The EPAs website says that the inhalation of air that contains ozone " can reduce the lung function and increase the breathing symptoms " such as asthma .	-4.3041
The Community Region wants .	-3.1273
In the end , the decision was clear : in the case of two opposing votes , the Municipal Council of Fluorn-Winkles decided to set up a common area in the future Senate Residence .	-6.8299
Before the discussion there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still missing property steal is signed , Mayor Bernhard Tjden reports .	-6.2801
Although it will still take time for the area of community ownership , which is now part of the church community , there is no longer any grounds for planning the project to be run by a private investor .	-7.6538
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-3.0283
One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to come to the town .	-3.0520
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area - about 55 square meters - and a adjacent terrace with as much as 70 square meters of space for a special price .	-5.9064
The administration and the majority of the community suggest that such a common area should not be seen as a meeting place only for the residents of sensory housing , but open to the community .	-6.6183
As an example , the word from " Strickcafé " made the round .	-3.9195
The decision made by the provision of funds for the current budget as early as last autumn will be provided with funding .	-5.8935
The building is located in the sanctuary .	-2.8303
The creation of a Community area , as Tjaden says , would be conducive to 60 % of 30 % .	-4.7301
The draft decision provides for a signal to the investor that in this respect , it does not want to throw a sticker between the legs , the observation that both the saddle - which is a reference to the environment - and the powder roof - which reduces the grape height and makes economic construction - would be possible .	-10.2266
Needless to say , not only Wilfried Sohmer , is this addition .	-4.2700
If 's helping : It 's going to happen unanimously .	-4.9048
It is not as easy as dealing with the Community area .	-4.0311
Daniela 's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which we do not really make progress , for which we are now opposed to the common area from the window , says : ' I am doing myself hard with it ' .	-8.0412
Yvonne Stainer is absolutely speaking out in favour of the Community area , but totally opposed to communal participation .	-5.1537
It sees a hidden subsidy from already well-off , or even foreign investors .	-2.9568
This is not the case , because if the area is purchased , it is not a grant , but it gets a real countervalue that can be marketable in doubt , that is the counter .	-8.3716
Staiger ’ s proposal to split up the resolution accordingly has three champions .	-5.4305
So it remains for the original programme to summarise Stefan Hall in such a way : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-5.9530
Colision by car : Radler is thrown on the street .	-3.6280
A 82-year-old driver was captured by a car on Wednesday in Garath on the road and was seriously injured .	-4.8387
As the police said , the 82-year-old Langenfelder at 12.20 was on his bike to the Schwarzer Straße cycle path towards Hilden .	-7.4617
The Senior wanted to pass the journey in the height of the street Am Buchholz Busch .	-5.7296
A car leader in the same direction gave him priority .	-3.3364
When the Langenfelder travelled to the streets , he did not seem to be looking for reciprocal traffic .	-6.6658
He joined a car who controlled a 66-year Hildenerin .	-4.9563
The man was thrown onto the street .	-1.9727
He suffered serious injuries and was brought into hospital with a rescue car .	-3.7403

The Supercup takes place without him : David Alaba has to let the game fight Dortmund .	-3.5249
The FC Bayern personnel travels to Dortmund for the first time in the new season .	-4.4607
Seven professionals lack the title defender in the supercup against the Cup .	-5.0854
The recruitment services at the German football recorder Bayern München are growing at Pokalsieger Borussia Dortmund on Saturday ( 20 : 30 pm / ZDF and Eurosport ) .	-5.8386
Trainer Carlo Ancelotti must also miss David Alaba in the Duell with the BVB .	-3.1021
The Italian confirmed this on Friday .	-1.8211
In addition , the Munich Manuel Neuer , James , Thiago , Jerome Boateng , Arjen Robben and Juan Bernat are missing .	-2.7794
Ancelotti has made the physical condition and lack of balance in the game of his team responsible for the five failures in the past six test games .	-5.5355
" We know that we are not in the best physical constitution , " said Ancelotti and added : " The most important point is the balance in the team .	-2.5229
Last but not least , it was good . '	-2.7420
However , the 58-year-old believes in a performance increase in the first official mandatory season .	-5.1295
" Football is also tactics , strategy , personality and motivation .	-0.9272
I have great confidence that my team reflects these qualities .	-2.6486
The team is ready .	-0.6158
We want to play intelligent , " said Ancelotti , who expects a " difficult , intensive game " .	-2.1726
The duel of the two German football slabs attracts fans in their camps .	-5.0005
The game was sold with 81.360 viewers , the German Football League ( DFL ) took place on Friday .	-3.7715
Walk to Stern ’ s Harz	-3.2616
The first " Starpfad " is to be created in Harz .	-5.9695
This is planned by the Association Sterwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-2.8515
There is a road map in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.7881
A " Starpfad " meets the need for information from a large number of hart visitors , it was said .	-7.3160
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.0675
Members want to set up the planned itinerary table and inform about stars and stars .	-5.4588
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " well accessible installations in five to six places " in Oberharz .	-4.0526
St. Andreasberg , Braunschlage , Hoegeiß and Sieber would be required .	-7.5910
The information on the boards should be added to the Internet .	-3.6211
That is why a good mobile network reception is key to selecting the location .	-5.2275
accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.6876
Later that year , the Starroad Trail was launched to expand its range of trains .	-7.9874
" On the Starpfad viewers know a lot of worth of knowledge , for example about the physics of individual stars " explained the association .	-6.4416
In addition , they learned why stars had different colors , or why a star was stronger than another , even though he was far away .	-5.4973
Also mediates the constellation in which a selected star is located and when he is best to see .	-5.1177
The association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountains of St. Andreasberg .	-5.2361
The location in the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany , according to the Federal Office for Natural Protection .	-4.6507
From there you can see the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with a clear eye .	-4.6441
Since 2003 , at the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen , there has been something similar to the planned Startwerg - the planetway .	-6.1435
Beginning in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetway leads with its steals to the Hainberg and the Sterwarte - as well as a " extraterranean " location in Dierarden ( municipality of equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-8.2630
The steals with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded at the end point of purpose - are set at an exact rate of one to two billion .	-6.5690
The Earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres in diameter , while the exact 75 m long Sun measures 70 centimetres .	-5.5083
The total distance of the route is four kilometres .	-4.3450
While light requires sun to the pluto about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to reach the slope with pluto .	-5.2639
So pedestrians are faster than the light around the world .	-2.2420
But the march to the next Fixster would last half a year .	-4.3861
Mikey Garcia and Vasily Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown .	-2.8178
Vatyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be in a collision course to stag the most exciting boxwar in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .	-5.0721
They were in separate rooms in ESPN-Büros in Los Angeles , to Garcia , the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion , the river went down to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-won Championship .	-5.6877
After Garcia ’ s victory by unanimous decision on the former Four-Division-World Champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime both fighters are members of the top five pound for Pound list .	-4.5217
Garcia stretched the right hand and said : " How are you going to Champion ?	-2.3439
I wish you good luck ' .	-1.7744
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at ESPN .	-2.5418
When the pair made for photos , Lomachenko Manager Etis Climate noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect order of magnitude " .	-4.5136
" I am a former Federal weight " , reminded Garcia .	-4.3927
" I grew up for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-2.7588
I am small for 140 .	-1.0586
I would like to come down to light weight .	-2.3473
And he has to move on lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-3.2450
That is what fans are demanding .	-2.1683
Let us give them that . '	-1.3304
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.5188
" Boxes need this battle . "	-3.1174
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that Lomachenko needs to fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) , which is also interested in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Lucke Campbell after their lightweight Title campaign in the Forum on 23 September .	-6.6130
" This battle could take place in pay-per-view mode , because all the fans asked for it " , Garcia said , and later expressed an open commitment to fight with the network that offers the best financial package .	-5.7980
We are the best .	-0.8674
No other name can create this kind of attention .	-1.8233
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.3905
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " and he might take part in his Saturday fight .	-4.2371
But Lomachenko held in the generous prayer for Garcia and said that he thought the three-campaign champion from Riverside " very slowly , sorry Mikey ... you want to win the " .	-6.3860
Garcia said that the focus was on showing the edge , then Boxes .	-3.4627
Both said they could feel the momentum that emerged for their own struggle .	-3.4754
" This is the fight that must be done .	-2.7781
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-1.6512
I 'm more than happy to work on it " , Garcia said .	-2.2533
Lomachenko said : " I waited for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.3185
It will be a great battle ' .	-1.7245
Four injured in tyre placement	-8.1406
On Thursday afternoon , four people were partially injured in an accident on the A7 .	-2.8648
After the first information , the driver of an Opel Zageria lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. in front of the market width probably after a tyre seat .	-13.4934
The car walked to the right , where it was overflowing and then left on the roof in the green strip .	-7.1832
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were seriously injured in the accident .	-2.5010
During the first delivery of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed to the north for about one hour , and then it was possible to avoid traffic on the left side of the accident .	-6.6562
Fortunas Hoffmann : " Dreakette works better "	-3.1070
Andre Hoffmann hopes , after the 2 : 2 on the Saisontakt against Braunschweig , that the optimisation of defense in Aue points .	-5.8598
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season season , with the result , would not have been the two opposing forces in the 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.4557
" These were two opposing points too much , and we need to be more careful in Aue , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.7000
In the Erzgebirge it is planned to further optimize the tripartite .	-5.9878
And a gate after a free shot is no longer in the spotlight .	-6.2453
" For the future , it will be so that no one will take the line next to Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-4.4303
Hoffmann is convinced that even after the experience of preparing the tripartite , his team is better able to cope with than with the Vierkerette .	-7.2727
" I don 't know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause " because we have just in the triangle on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can rebuild well " , Hoffmann said .	-6.6930
" It is necessary , but that we are even better harmonising and we do not make so many mistakes in the construction " .	-5.5840
Of course Hoffmann also moves to Aue to win the game .	-2.5371
" But it doesn 't know whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw .	-4.7255
The performance could be okay , " Hoffmann said .	-3.4666
" But if we stand on the Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal shot " .	-6.6338
His coach did not want to know about that .	-3.8123
" I only judge the start of the season after six to eight days , " says Friedhelm sparkle , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of an unwetter .	-6.4866
" Now they can start the season with a home game " said sparkle and Hoffmann believe that Aue players might even be a bit more fresh , since they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rise favorites in the bones .	-8.1089
" But they do not know so 100 % where they are at the moment , " says the internal defender of the Fortuna .	-4.7593
The guests from the Rheinland as a lighter favorite on Sunday go to the meeting in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue .	-5.3281
" The fact that we challenge them simply because we are entitled to come under the first six is Bloodson , " says Funkel , whose record in only one defeat against Aue from nine games is very positive .	-6.6206
" There is no team in the second Bundesliga to be beat from the outset " explains Fortunas Chefcoach .	-4.2207
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and obsessive " .	-2.4776
And so it won 't want to unfold its players on Sunday .	-4.6731
New results of the Swedish Asylum Age Assessment Test	-4.3503
The recent results of testing for asylum seekers in Sweden , which have undergone a new medical evaluation method for their age , show that more than 80 % of the people who have been tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of those results .	-5.7703
The Swedish Authority for Forensian Medicine ( Rattsminic Salt ) started to carry out the tests last year .	-6.0953
During the asylum process , they should make the assessment of age more precise , after the Swedish immigration authority ( migratory shortages ) was criticised for errors in judging the correct age of some refugees who were underage .	-7.6149
To date , migration sales has sent 6.880 cases of testing , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2.481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-4.9011
Eighteen percent ( 2002 ) were considered 18 or older , while in another 25 cases Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.6895
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years of age " .	-2.3931
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person 's age is questioned .	-8.8166
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over recent months .	-3.0485
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.2821
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age .	-9.7924
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases , which ' suggest that the tested person is 18 years or older ' .	-3.3088
When Svenska Dagblad studied the 581 published results , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-4.0465
The method of medical age assessment , in which radiological measurements are made of soft teeth and MRT shots of kneels , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-8.3741
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes judging people ’ s biological maturity to see whether they were previously or later usually hit by the puberty .	-5.2721
" I had reason to think about this and I do not think that the kind of measurement should be used .	-2.8935
Identifying the biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-3.4561
If we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , " he said the Metro newspaper .	-4.1868
However , Göransson from the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of having a child as an adult is incorrect is low .	-4.8094
The greatest risk is if the person is just under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.4435
Full in the Plan	-1.4818
Work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well underway .	-4.2555
On Wednesday a seven tonnes of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.3090
" We are very good at the time , it is running super " , says Reinhold Leicht , construction manager at the department road and traffic in the Governing Presidium Freiburg .	-5.6090
In April the works began at the same time at all three needy bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-8.4560
The end of the project is scheduled for October , and it is easy to see that the timetable is adhered to .	-5.0692
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , runs through the Trombach .	-2.8074
It is a reinforced reinforced reinforced reinforced reinforced reinforced reinforced reinforced reinforced quarry with a total length of 4.80 meters .	-6.1590
It was built in 1900 .	-2.0873
As the other two bridges do , they have come into the years .	-3.2004
In order to ensure stability and transport safety , the three buildings are now properly reconstructed .	-4.1505
The other two bridges lead over the Lauterbach .	-2.2009
They are made of red brick .	-2.4164
Both were built in 1939 and twelve or 10,60 meters long .	-2.4512
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach , which was built on Wednesday morning on the northern side , received a bridge cap of 1.30 metres and seven tonnes of heavy bridge .	-5.9514
This is a marginal attachment that is also used as a working way .	-3.6816
On the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter long bridge will be used on Friday .	-4.0245
That is what the pedestrian route is supposed to take .	-5.2125
The particular thing is that they are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizko .	-5.0158
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.9165
Special sensation of fingertips has required the installation of lines through the construction in Lauterbach .	-4.5984
Because there is also a glass fibre sheet that many companies are connected to .	-5.5581
The residents were informed of the project in advance of the works by means of handzettel .	-5.1790
In addition , initially fish and cancer had to be fished .	-4.2994
For the bridges between the Bauhaus building and the timber collection in the direction of Schramberg , the traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-4.9908
For the construction work on the bridge on Lauterbacher 's doorstep , the road is fully closed in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " .	-4.8710
The cost of the three bridges amounts to EUR 700 000 .	-1.9187
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-3.4425
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protests at German potato salad .	-3.0083
It is not so often the case that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) comes together , which will otherwise be hard to get under a hat .	-6.5015
The parties represented in the Kreuztag Volcanozefel ( CDU , SPD , Grüne , FDP , FWG , left ) are part of a broad alliance that shows on this day peaceful flag , because the AfD invites in the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell to the " big campaign " by poster .	-7.5283
And , like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the top duo for the German election on September 24 , and the Vice-Chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-6.0208
But those who have been on the ground for hours before the event began do not want to listen to the AfD visitors , but to demonstrate .	-6.5412
The motto " The Eifel remains colored " .	-2.1821
Originally , the city picnic was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place on the car park below the Rondell - and in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-6.9675
A colorful picture here .	-3.1161
And what Christia Karoli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the crucial organizers , is really happy : ' Toll how many people have met here ' .	-6.1387
There is music and a lot of food , including a " German potato salad , which the AfD could eat without any problems " , says the woman who brought him with it .	-11.5406
The police have ordered a lot of officials to Gerolstein , it shows presence at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues .	-6.0024
How did the AfD actually come on Gerolstein ?	-2.0949
Mario Hompes from the AfD Volcanic Show reported that he tried and obtained this event .	-6.8866
The 45-year-old from Günnersdorf had first inquired in Daun , but got a cancellation because of the already built Laurentius churches there was not enough parking space .	-5.7646
So now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-4.4381
In view of the event at the Rondellplatz he says : " This is the good right of people , the main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.1491
This is also true : at the end of the day the Rondellplatz provides a band for entertainment , in the city hall various speakers , including the Rhineland-Palatinate AfD chair Uwe Junge .	-8.6562
There are about 200 people in the Chamber who are waiting for the top candidate for the parliamentary election , Alice Weidel , and the Vice-Chairman Beatrix of Storch hold their speeches .	-5.4819
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.2989
The AfD event lasts more than one hour , the guests on the front desk have a longer breath , but there is a call to clean up shortly after 21 o 'clock .	-8.5321
The police can get away - no special events .	-3.3311

Together with the Bulgarian Trompeter Miroslav Petkov , he gives a concert under the slogan " Schwarzmeer hits on Black Forest " , or even " Balkan folklore " meets a classic German education with roots in blasme .	-6.0110
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and have held solo positions in top European orchestras .	-3.8198
Petkov Solotrompeter is thus the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is Soloposaurist of the SWR Symphony Orchestra .	-3.7582
Both unite the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the borders of the various genres .	-3.6576
As a result , Johann Sebastian Bach ’ s two songs , as in a new guy , Daniel Schnayders , " Weltmusik " , are combined with Bulgarian folklore , and in the " Exchange Suite " of the Jazz Prize Nils Wogra , mixing classical , jazz and free games into a fascinating overall art work .	-9.8219
This core of the program was premiered only this spring with huge success in Freiburg .	-3.3026
The renowned composer Nils Wogram has written it for the two musicians , and more so : The Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately involved in the concert .	-5.7486

I was really very struck by this .	-3.9778
When I was eleven I said the children , I would look like a bub .	-3.8087
I felt I was really assaulted , frightened and ashamed .	-3.8400
Now I look back and think : ' Girl , be proud of you ! ' .	-2.3586
Especially the public does not like to explain their loved ones : " People expect you to behave in a certain way and that angers me .	-4.6943

He said he 'm sorry for " all athletes who were cut off in gold and silver medals in competitions " .	-3.8023
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found references to state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.8512
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.8271

Coe said he is also " happy " that Russia accepts the criteria for its reinstatement .	-3.4269

" We must do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation .	-2.6922
The principle was always that we wanted to separate the clean athletes from the spoiled system , " he added .	-3.4170
Nineteen Russian athletes will compete as neutral players in the World Championship held in London on Friday , according to the strict IAAF criteria .	-4.4888
The Director of the IAAF Task Force , Rune Andersen , said on Monday that Russia still needs to meet some of the criteria for reappointment .	-3.5099

The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard finished a sarcophag for the two .	-2.7960
The Queen was in agreement with the decision of her husband , saying it was still in the communication .	-5.1228
Where Prince Henrik is going to bury , it is still unclear . the are . . the are . . . are . . . . .	-9.9941
But he does not intend to be added to his French home .	-3.2605
Prince Henrik never made a secret of not happy with his title .	-3.5606
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would like to have become king .	-4.4230
He retired in 2016 and also fills the " print number " title .	-4.3867

While his later wife always fled the popular sympathy , Prince Henrik had a severe stand in the Danes in his 50-year rainship .	-6.2448
In a autobiography , Henrik expressed for the first years in Denmark : " Only a few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticised .	-3.9867
My Danish was gay , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk champagne instead of knit socks , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , Tennis instead of football .	-4.5227
Even for the Gauloises I smoked instead of Virginia tobacco , who had the reputation of being the brand of critical intellectuals of society , I could not be forgiven .	-5.4988
I was different .	-0.9258
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not to be ashamed of .	-2.6692

Prime Minister Weil wants swift re-election	-2.9279
CDU and FDP versus a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-2.2321
Dutch Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is after the loss of the red-green majority of government for a quick re-election of the day , but he does not want to resign .	-4.6153
Because , on Friday , we spoke out in favour of Parliament 's resolution .	-4.4263
Previously , the surprise exit of a Green MEP from her country in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-5.1632
Five months before the country election official deadline , the red-green coalition in Hanover lost its narrow one-stop majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.9680
The Green MPs Elke Twestern so far founded their step with the non-nomination of 2018 in their constituency in Rotenburg ( Wüste ) .	-6.9720
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained in Hanover on Friday .	-1.8255
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to accept them .	-3.9647
This means that CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony country , SPD and Grüne 68 seats .	-5.0592
So far , the ratio has been reversed .	-1.7650
The new country day will be regular elected on 14 January next year .	-8.5210
Thumler said that the red-green regional government must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.8402
Stephan Weil , however , thinks it is essential that the day of the land be decided on its self-determination as soon as possible .	-9.4095
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-3.3162
National constitution also provides for the opportunity for the prime minister to leave confidence and elect a successor .	-9.5233
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.3869
These possibilities need to be reviewed legally neatly , " said Thümler .	-4.6543
" You will discuss all the questions when they are legally reasonable . "	-5.7205
Thümler called the Twwest step " but rather rather curious " .	-5.5504
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.5579
I feel myself very good .	-1.6651
She referred to her as an attacker from Schwarz-Grün .	-4.7924
The Greens asked the penny Members to return their country mandate .	-4.2371
" We assume , of course , that she immediately rescinded her country mandate , which she received through the green country list , " the Chairman of the National Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-6.3220
The Group Chairman of the Greens , Anja Piel , said : ' We deplore the decision by Elke Twest extremely ' .	-4.1963
You have made a conscious decision not to hold a debate in the group .	-2.6810
" Even against the background that there were no substantive differences , we cannot understand this step " .	-3.5923
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the takeover of the Lower Saxony Green Members Elke Twestern to the CDU as betrayal .	-4.4546
" The behaviour of former Green Members in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to the voters , but also betrayal of Red Green , " the Social Democrats wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-12.5033
He supports the decision by Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) to quickly re-elect the country day .	-4.4888
The exit of Twest costs the majority in Lower Saxony .	-3.4185
" In their wounded vanity and their frustration their personal interests against the welfare of the country , " the SPD Secretary-General , Hubertus Heir , criticised .	-6.1304
" It is scandalous that the CDU is playing in Lower Saxony this dirty introspective game and trying to capitalize on it " .	-6.1674
Niedersacsen CDU Group leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his MEPs to include Elke Twest in the CDU .	-12.5937
The leader of the SPD in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , told Twest to falsify the result of the 2013 country election with personal career figures .	-5.7981
The CDU was the strongest force before the SPD , but SPD and green had a very thin majority of one voice in the country day .	-5.3016
Minister of Agriculture in the Interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous , Mr Schmidt ?	-3.0266
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.6707
How could the scandal happen ?	-0.7993
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.8804
Minister of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is in the interview with the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-10.2520
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.9618
I can only encourage all consumers to check the eggs in their refrigerator exactly and check the stamp pressure .	-3.3431
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food Warning .de , the German countries will provide the latest information on the eggs in question .	-7.1314
Oaks affected should be destroyed or returned .	-2.9905
Even if , in accordance with everything we know at the moment , there is practically no health hazard .	-3.6901
Does Aldi now oversee the best possible crisis response - all the eggs out of supply - because the central role of the collector is not really noticed by the Federal Ministry of Economic Affairs ?	-6.9782
Food surveillance is the responsibility of the federal states .	-2.2906
Nevertheless , my House has moved on without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it was announced .	-5.4569
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-2.4082
Trade , like manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are viable and safe in health .	-11.1318
If the maximum residue content of 0.0005mg / kg is exceeded , these are not viable .	-3.8598
However , unburdened eggs can be sold and eaten .	-2.8399
This time , businesses are not to blame .	-1.8245
Do production companies and consumers sit on the same boat ?	-2.8842
According to current knowledge , production companies are not directly guilty .	-4.1845
On the contrary , they have to face economic damage due to suspected illegal practices by service companies .	-3.5861
As always , there are too few controllers in the worst case .	-2.6326
Is it just a matter of personnel or of the key competence ?	-5.5604
After all , it was the official checks that revealed the process .	-3.8655
But the truth is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-2.8283
It is precisely for this reason that a consistent investigation of such events and the transfer to public prosecutors in cases where offences can be available is of crucial importance .	-6.0342
I have made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the competent authorities .	-3.3788
Is regular alarms in food scandals really necessary ?	-3.4145
Consumers have the right to obtain exclusively safe and viable food .	-2.5705
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly outraged .	-3.2055
The amount of money that has been spread has left manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-6.3626
In principle , it must be clear that the illegal use of the fipronil insecticides in the attitude of life-saving animals is unacceptable and must be brought to an end immediately .	-5.5126
This needs to be done consistently and with high pressure .	-8.4572
I expect all the relevant authorities to ensure that the matter is resolved quickly and completely .	-9.8972
How football ’ s financial rules affect Neymars move to Paris .	-7.0057
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted expenditure from the European football clubs will not disturb Neymars World Recort-Transfer from Spain Barcelona to the French Paris-Staint Germain .	-6.7463
Some of the consequences will be for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from accessing the prestigious Championship League tournament .	-5.9537
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-3.8119
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian out of its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary of several $ 10 million a year .	-3.5920
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.9833
PSG can certainly make money loose to sign Neymar and bring him into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team by the energetic ruling family of Qatar .	-5.0705
Associations may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but have to compete with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to get the Break Eve point in their football related business .	-6.9425
FFFP was conceived by Michel Platini as his election to UEFA president in 2007 .	-3.5604
Former French players believed that clubs that took huge debts in their quest to succeed could cheat effectively and risk ruin if banks or owners withdraw their support .	-4.8188
In 2011 , FFFP moved from concentrating on the debt of the club to monitoring its losses .	-2.8990
The change meant that the business model , which Roman Abramovich used in 2003 in Chelsea , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve team and build a global brand , should become a tougher issue .	-4.7585
During the current three-year FFP retirement period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-4.0293
And , while Platini fell in undgnade from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Cederin , continues to advocate deterring excessive spending .	-5.4061
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future " , Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , said to The Associated Press last week .	-3.6832
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for the invoice over the duration of its contract .	-4.3218
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the income envelope for the next five years can be accounted for in the amount of EUR 44.4 million in the annual .	-5.3733
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has hit the strongest sanctions .	-3.2119
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 championship league remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-4.4956
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to list their financial supervision by inflating their income from companies that are connected with the owners of a club .	-6.5091
While a Catholic company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not have this as legitimate income .	-3.8246
That was precisely what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was blown up by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.4705
It has been reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to terms with payments from the WM 2022 organizing committee in Qatar .	-4.7946
But PSG and Qatar 2022 contested that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and such a maneuver for UEFA regulators could easily be found out .	-4.7408
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.7081
The UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG via Neymars Transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-4.1220
You spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not allowed to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.8133
The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-3.0682
The accounts for the last financial year must be published .	-2.2520
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a boon for sponsoring deals , merchandising , and triple sales .	-3.7521
The Association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.0241
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go , and it tried to prevent Neymars 's move by arguing that PSG would violate the FFP .	-10.1716
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS newspaper in relation to PSG Qatars .	-5.1810
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances a club .	-3.6459
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the whole landscape of football in the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-3.4620
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.4556
It is very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.1445
Swiss is looking for a new shock absorber .	-1.9041
In recent years , Chocolat Frey Bord chocolate has been produced for Swiss .	-2.3212
Now sweet cooperation is coming to a possible end : the airline is rewriting its order .	-4.3213
Swiss-Prescherin Meike Fullrott confirmed on request from the news agency sda an appropriate report from the newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " on Friday .	-5.9362
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-3.0988
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and subject to quality control .	-2.8970
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.1045
Around 17 million small rot white shock panels spread to the passengers every year before .	-6.0865
The Swiss did not want to provide any information about the costs .	-2.7586
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to " North-West Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migratis subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of about one billion francs .	-6.0881
But above all , it is more important to advertise : it is a prestigious order for a rogue producer .	-6.4850
The Swiss does not want to betray how many applicants there are in the new tendering procedure .	-5.7010
However , only Swiss manufacturers are eligible for this .	-5.2655
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the Treaty on spring 2018 .	-3.6443
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate producer was not available for an opinion .	-2.5682
The Swiss distributes chocolate panels on board their flights since 2006 .	-3.9232
Before the Swiss signed a contract with the Migro daughter , Barry Callebaut supplied the chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug .	-3.1656
Swiss introduced the possibility to place the logo two and a half years ago with the start of cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.1338
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.6887
On long-haul flights , the First Class ’ s customers are pampered with delicacies from the ConfiSere Sprüngli , in Business Class wet passengers Schoggi from Lindt and in the Economy Class Schoggi of Chocolat Frey .	-6.1057
Swiss Schoggi of Chocolat Frey , both in Business and Economy Class , are also on the shortcut .	-5.7782

The three-time World Champion fights for a medal on Saturday in the final .	-2.9005
His brother , Christoph , Olympic champion of 2016 , failed in the national World Cup apprenticeship and could only look at the Diskus competition from the gallery .	-6.8722
Also with the first attempt , the Polish title defender Piotr Malachowski , who ran 65.13 metres wide , took the final fight .	-12.8298
Nostalgia goes to " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " in the Nische .	-2.9387
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic for the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-year grunge era ( when the forefathers David Wain and Michael Shorwalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - in other words , for 2001 , before their stars , like Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things .	-6.0767
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and a concealment of our Facebook era of permanent memories .	-4.3735
But as a franchise it feels as if time were short .	-2.0834
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humour ( it contained an original story for a talking dose of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.7272
By attacking the core of the game - middle-aged actors are playing horny children who will grow up - they have the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke .	-6.2804
" Ten Years Latin " , with his adult who is now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more after the poisonous principle , including a reff on the 90-year Stalker movies like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand that arrows the cradle " ) .	-7.1812
At one point , a character scored by an Apple Powerbook , some Inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.9439
Many of the central stories are the same .	-0.8924
The loving Coop ( Mr. Shorwalter ) , now Romanaut , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-4.3191
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his childhood .	-2.3366
And there is another crazy malignant plot , included in Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Shorwalter ) , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-4.3068
As always , the prices are the best part of the franchise .	-2.5447
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , the Matt Dillon 's sublime bart of " singles " , whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old knack .	-5.1024
They are the moments of random wagons that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeated " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I saw as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Latin " , whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the film premiums of " Hot American Summer " .	-5.5544
" Comrade Detective " at Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , of the film " Atomic Blogs " and even of " GLOW " with its East Itself West Ringcampaign iconography .	-5.6154
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as director , indicates that he is a winning TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers of Bucharest who fight for truth , atheism and the way of Marxism Leninism .	-5.8026
The main rolls - a hard-saturated Gregor and an idealist Iosif - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues of Channing Tatt ( also a performer ) and Joseph Gordon Levitt in English are synchronized .	-5.3551
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.8766
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.3529
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spends time watching chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-4.6476
And the list of famous speakers , including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershaala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny , gives a decent game ' Find out the Voice ' .	-4.3658
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.8545
There are six long episodes , and the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-3.0553
" Comrade Detective " , which has been revised to a lesser length , could better deliver its agitprop acid , since Gregor and Iosf always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who donate a bunch of Hamburger .	-7.1456
The message to the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can do everything for a gelage .	-2.4661
The Romanian creators were not wrong : we are even doing it with our own recent history and with the theirs .	-3.8580
Blast against drug-mafia in the country	-1.9366
The police managed a blow against the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-2.5270
On Wednesday morning , in the Black Forest Baar circle , in Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , many objects were explored , as the Prosecutor 's Office said on Friday .	-6.0581
In doing so , 15 people were arrested between 25 and 77 years of age and have already issued arrest warrants against them .	-6.4209
Moreover , the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , guns , and several hundred thousand euros .	-3.9971
At the same time , two people were arrested in Italy .	-3.0157
German arrest warrants were contravened by the two suspects Italians . .	-12.2762
The two are therefore presumably delivered to Germany .	-2.3381
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-2.7956
In total , over 300 police were deployed .	-2.6320
The members of the Mafia are subjected to organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder and robbery and blackmail .	-4.6732
Since summer 2016 , the prosecutor 's office has established a conjugation against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-5.1410
Between the Constantians and Palermo there was a lively exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues on Sicily .	-5.4238
Thus , on Wednesday morning , four Palermo officials accompanied the grand deal .	-4.3377
In this regard , the investigators ' visa is particularly relevant to Italian mafia citizens .	-7.6470

Looks in the Foreign Register	-3.4185
" Citizens ' data , which should not arise , " According to a report , the Ausseer Register in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-6.1087
This leads to some serious misdecisions on asylum procedures .	-3.5270
According to the Federal Government ’ s representative for the refugee management , Frank Jürgen , a media report has drawn attention to major gaps in the foreign-central register .	-11.5953
Failure in the data registered there could lead to ' some serious failure decisions ' in the case of asylum procedures and deportations , warning in an analysis submitted by the ' Southern German newspaper ' .	-5.5463
According to the register , ten million people with a foreign nationality are included , including around 5.7 million from non-EU .	-3.5273
The data is therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.3737
Because the data had not been properly maintained , the quality of the data has not been good in some cases .	-5.4073
In individual cases , data were found in 1921 , " from people who have long since lost their lives , or from citizens who have become German citizens , and who should not actually be included in the register " .	-7.1854
" Flawed data records can considerably slow return processes " , says the report continues .	-5.5241
Moreover , the statistics on people subject to travel on people who are subject to travel would include EU citizens who would not have to travel .	-5.7797
Such false arrangements , however , ' led to a distorted debate on the use of excuses ' , which means in the analysis .	-5.3201
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun to return refugees with less than 16 years of children to Italy when they are from there .	-6.0218
This is produced from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.6608
The paper therefore states that the BAMF 's lead in such procedures ' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and young children - has been reinstated in Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-7.3770
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , as the newspaper indicates the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.2132
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for reaching the first .	-3.7100
If a migrants travels to another EU country , that state can return it to the country of entry .	-4.7705
As for the explanatory statement , the office now says : ' There has been a significant increase in the absorption capacity for families with underage children in Italy ' .	-5.3377
Italy provided guarantees for families ’ reception and accommodation .	-2.8860
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) regards these commitments as sufficient .	-2.8593
Other EU states would also be sending back refugees under the Dublin Agreement .	-3.7796
The leader of the left-wing faction in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : ' families with children are threatened with conditions of human rights and a threat to the welfare of children because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system ' .	-6.5778
Twenty-second fruit achieved	-3.5481
In total , 220 litres of blood in Oberrichenbach had already been available to other people .	-4.0351
At least from the twelve citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-2.4782
First of all , Jürgen Greule , who now has a 100 donation now has 50 litres of blood .	-6.1235
Traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the commune acknowledges the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-4.5142
" It is ingenious how our body is built for it and we pay tribute to the donors who make their blood available to strangers for their own benefit , " underscored Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-7.6075
" One blood donation helps several people " , explained by the head of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , for the Conservatives are dismantled into their parts .	-6.7869
For example , three people could benefit from blood donation .	-2.9654
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions that were carried out in Oberrichenbach in spring .	-4.1612
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK Sponsor Director .	-4.6310
Evidently , the transition to the theatre house had led to higher participation numbers a few years ago .	-4.7486
Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 paid blood donations .	-4.4277

The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-0.8899
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakened speculation about an increase .	-4.0300
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " jobs " when it placed interest rates on family income in the middle of increased pressure .	-4.4612
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) policymakers agreed , with 6 to 2 , to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members expected this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-5.4596
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecast to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % for 2018 , warning that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-4.1487
But they signaled that , in the next few years , rate hikes would be needed to curb the inflation fueled by Brexit , and she said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-5.9727
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing part of the Mammut stimulus package that was issued a year ago after Brexit .	-3.3932
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to make <unk> 15 billion more available under this system - with <unk> 115 billion sterling .	-5.6961
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the central forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on real household income continues to strain consumption . '	-4.4233
At the interest rates , it reiterated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' somewhat larger ' scale than the markets would expect .	-5.8725
Markets are currently projecting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-1.9963
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " step-by-step " and " limited " .	-2.6585
The Bank ’ s post-revised growth forecasts for this and next year are relative to the 1.9 % forecast in May and 1.7 % .	-3.2855
It maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.6668
The pound fell against the dollar and the euro after these news .	-3.2359
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , and fell 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .	-2.3444
The decision will not change after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced rising expectations to an increase in interest rates , and GDP increased to 0.3 % in the second quarter of 0.2 % in the previous three months .	-4.3751
Growth is expected to be at 0.3 % in the third quarter , despite the fact that it will have a slight recovery by the end of the year .	-4.5370
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases , as tightening becomes worse first before it becomes better .	-4.0750
She added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent the collapse of income in the next few years ' , but she added that , by the end of its three-year forecast , wages will ' recover significantly ' .	-5.4506
The economy will also be strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.8953
The decision will come one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound 's sensation .	-3.3389
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve prices and the economy in full .	-2.7097
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates has increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.1857
Last month , inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that it was expected to do so and that it would pay back in the coming months .	-5.2211
The Bank said that the ratio to its 2 % target is ' to the weak pound ' .	-4.2613
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent fall in the swap rates , the mortgage market should become more competitive again , because lenders would like to search loudly for business and end the year in a positive way .	-5.6095
The market looks particularly good for those in which the existing deals expire and take out new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming ever more popular . '	-5.2885
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is to prescribe a controversial HIV drug 10 000 people .	-3.8414
Patients will be granted access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment starting in September following a fight against the financing of the NHS drug .	-4.1684
NHS England announced that a pre-sex pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of inflammatory risk by about 86 % , will now be delivered by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-6.8953
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s appeal court confirmed a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the authority to pay for the PrEP , despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-3.9791
The appeal announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS English-Chairman Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this a " decisive moment " . the .	-11.3373
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and other clinics will follow in October , before being introduced in the whole of England in April 2018 .	-4.1889
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.3869
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infectious children .	-3.9457
Taking PrEP before sex means that there are enough medications in one person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection .	-4.1843
Such drugs can be taken every day or so already two hours before gender traffic .	-10.1810
Those who get into question the treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-4.3726
In clinics , appropriate participants are identified who agree to the study , including men , women , transcenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.7578
People who live in England and are registered with a house doctor can register for possible participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-4.0735
The programme is signed <unk> 10 million and NHS England a contract to supply the drugs this week after international competitive procurement .	-4.0467
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence as set out , absorbed and implemented on a large scale .	-4.5915
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.6327
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of continued progress in dealing with one of the greatest health challenges of humanity . "	-4.5873
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.1441
PrEP , if targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.5702
From September to September people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiations with a partner , which will lead to the improvement of many , many lives .	-5.2592
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.4854
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be for the study to be carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV to be left behind .	-4.5309
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been established , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-4.0068
Sharon Hodgson , shadow Minister for Health , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delay and hesitant implementation by the government .	-4.0910
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be as part of our approach to HIV prevention and how to stop the transmission of these life-changing infection .	-3.8857
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.1611
It is now important for this study to be carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help to bring about a step towards ending the spread of HIV in society . '	-13.0233
The great lives are living : On the ground floor and clever designer tricks have transformed this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-5.3313
Joanne Leigh , a former bank with a passion for real estate , fell from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-3.1005
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne did not pack and sell her bags .	-3.0442
" I live in Knightsbridge with my ex- in a much larger room " , says Joanne .	-3.1038
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-1.7470
I found this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-7.7066
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . '	-3.0404
Since the first visit the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely outdated .	-3.3710
Originally a one-room property with a squeezed layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Stauroom and a basement room to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling height .	-7.2769
" I wanted high ceilings , big windows , lots of light .	-1.9558
That was my requirement , ' she says .	-2.2439
For this purpose , she invited the architects and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12,5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development , but also a place for Joanne .	-11.6990
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms on each other , so the architectural challenge was to create a ground floor where one could stand .	-4.7954
Erfan had to think creative to solve the preset .	-3.4420
" The steel mill is rather complicated , " he explains .	-3.0100
" We had to arranged the rooms in such a way that they were joined together without us having to bow .	-5.3742
It was not just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel that he had the right height for the function above or below . "	-4.3923
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full height each other - with much additional drama .	-4.2790
For the ground floor there is a classical copper window from Retrouvius below the glamorous living area .	-5.8485
Fixed gold furniture , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.1125
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.9389
A short corridor is mirrored on both ends to allow it to function longer .	-2.6221
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.6913
At the entrance , mirrored units provide space for all chests and glasses of Joanne .	-4.0260
By the perception of a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if not used .	-8.6404
Closed kitchens are nothing new .	-2.4578
The special thing about this is that it is a garage haven .	-4.2860
" A bit of engineering went there , " explains Erfan of the stahlheitten MDF door .	-5.6209
" It is opposite , so it is very easy to move the door . "	-4.7274
Thanks to the clever use of room and closet space , Joanne could win an additional 16 m ² , an extra bedroom and an improved layout .	-4.1040
" At the end of the day you will sell the land - or how your property is appreciated " , says Erfan .	-3.0915
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate broker will run and a calculation based on the size of the land " .	-3.7295
They have managed to increase the floor while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.4998
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.9942
" You don 't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.9595
They are important , but they do not play with your heart ' .	-2.4483
It shows that an apartment can turn by good design and increased square meters from something quite amazing .	-5.5308
In fact , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-2.3293
Brothers are struggling because of a $ 500 million real-estate empire .	-3.9160
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are engaged in a dispute over one of the greatest real-estate imperial Victoria worth more than $ 500 million .	-4.6437
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a Villa in Toorak , just three doors from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to share their property and business assets .	-4.0593
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp debate on the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.9178
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-3.5360
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.8445
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.2392
This money has been invested in real estate and De Lutis 's portfolio now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast , Mt Buller and shopping centres in the city of Vorstadt .	-4.4568
According to an agreement with its late father , Colin - described by Paul as the " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of corporate wealth and Paul about a third .	-11.3829
A legal act states that this means that Colin has ownership of $ 316 million , and Paul has a value of $ 176 million .	-5.3715
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.9241
" The split proposed by Colin has left him with what I thought was best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first affidivity .	-5.6314
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first consultation of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.8715
The brothers now also struggle for control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , excluded him .	-4.0643
Colin argues that this is not true , but claims Paul to manage some incompetent properties .	-3.2094
In an early affair submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-3.4497
" My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-8.0469
The costs are increasing in the case , with hundreds of pages with affiliates , e-mails and reports of companies , including Deloitte Partners , and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and lawyers held by both sides .	-6.0551
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and dairy farms from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.9365
They used the safety to buy the Collingwood-decker in which Column opened up the family 's first jet slabs .	-6.4343
Colin says he started Westco there when he was " in my last years of high school , when Paul was another little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.9929
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to hand over their property to their sons .	-2.7809
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-2.0917
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of De Lutis ’ s group of companies , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid 10 million dollars and Luke 26 million dollars at leaving the company .	-4.4379
Both Lukas and Mark are , Paul says , " said about the conditions of their financial separation " .	-4.4273
Colin was very retired , even though he was a former AFL member and , after a biography in 2015 , Eddie McGuire was the best friend of the TV star .	-5.0262
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.3414
Only Colin replied to SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-2.8126
" It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts " , he wrote .	-3.9150
In the middle of 2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to fulfill the demands of his brother .	-3.4258
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-3.1030
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-2.0985
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future " , wrote Colin .	-2.2526
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to curb the president ’ s media abstinence .	-3.0544
Others tried and failed .	-1.3032
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-1.4170
If so , he will be the first .	-0.9596
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to curb the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on a more even-handed course .	-4.3023
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.5656
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met with senior staff on his first day of work , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wants to repair : bad information coming into the hands of the president .	-4.1971
Kelly told the staff that information about it should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information ' .	-4.5442
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-2.9002
President Trump ’ s television relationship is going back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-4.1477
" If Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of posts that were to be persuaded , " said former election campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico .	-5.1051
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a continuous praise . "	-3.7335
Okay .	-0.4980
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever " under control " is ridiculous .	-2.2420
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have given even more inhibition without their interventions .	-5.5056
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.8106
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble a few times , then their efforts have been worthwhile .	-5.7439
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from provoking controversy .	-2.2494
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting a material to Trump that may promote their views from the world .	-4.8370
Politico - and this history is full of history - reported in May on the preference of advisers to provide questionable information to the President for strategic reasons .	-5.9248
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.6988
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press parts , especially those with disgraceful leaks , and that he is auctioning to find out where they come from .	-5.5090
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone malicious gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being the source behind a pile of leaks in the White House .	-5.7837
Although Johnson was banned permanently from Twitter for harassment , or was unable to provide any concrete evidence , or that he made false allegations in the past and revoked them .	-5.6569
Trump read the article and started to consult staff about Walsh . '	-2.3206
Goldmacher added that the former chief of staff , Reence Priebus , and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , ' tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper that Trump receives ' .	-5.1885
How did it work ?	-2.0792
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .	-1.3620
Perhaps he will prove to be a more effective manager than Priebus , but Trump is still his imperial self , and his advisors are still striving for influence .	-3.8709
These immovable factors make Kelly 's mission very difficult .	-1.8252
Most wanted criminals are sent to Europol 's post .	-8.0784
As the address is unknown , it is requested and hoped for help from the population .	-5.0491
Police throughout Europe this summer ( virtual ) postcards sent to dangerous criminals to flee .	-3.2640
Since the addresses of the gravel criminals sought are , of course , not known , the public is hoping for and praying for evidence .	-12.8917
Europol reported on Friday of the action following the " EU Most Wanted " Advent Calendar from Winter .	-3.5772
The experience would have shown that many refugees hide from holiday destinations , it was said by Europol .	-6.6064
We have compiled 21 postcards for sought criminals from 21 EU countries .	-2.8837
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted , more than 2.5 million times it has been considered .	-5.1312
36 of the online searches have been recorded so far , at least eleven of them due to references after the publication on the website .	-3.9464
Travelers are negotiating a divide and are returning to the Millionaire series .	-4.0445
Some of the most prosperous homeowners of the West Midlands stand again with some determined travelers on martial grounds , who have negotiated one of the graves of the community to demand a field back in front of their man.	-8.2475
The travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy road called the " Millionary Series " .	-5.1963
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after being exposed only in May , without , however , being discouraged by a torch from the Council in order to prevent their passages .	-6.7519
The tactful group found a gap in defence installations and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.6801
Waiting residents have urged the Solihull Council , who said that ' it is useless to address the problem ' .	-5.4392
An anonymous resident said : " You got there on Monday evening after being sent to Bentley Heath where they cast stones on the passers-by .	-5.2266
The Council must indeed be forced by shame of implementation because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.4265
The travellers were there in May , moved further and are now back .	-3.4174
More arrived yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.9042
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by holding long signatures to protect its parks .	-4.3826
I live on the streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community for if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-5.0607
A native who did not want to be called , said : " It is ridiculous that we saw just the last round of those travellers just to be plundered from another round .	-5.0992
The figures have increased this time and have even seen a horse in the park area ' .	-3.1212
One speaker from the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of unauthorised storage in the country beyond the streetbrook road and work with the police of Solihull , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as quickly as possible .	-6.5995
In order to support our communication , it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour with the police by calling 101 .	-4.2599
This helps to create an image of the situation in which the court has to examine when we are presenting our case ' .	-4.3132
From Birkenhof is Waldhotel Luise .	-1.3334
From the former Hotel Birkenhof , the Waldhotel Luise will be .	-3.1954
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt will be renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.8580
These are good news for the city .	-1.7147
After all , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 nights were lost each year and also revenue from the Kurtax .	-6.9049
In the autumn of 2014 , the hotel building was offered to the district council as a collective accommodation in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the district , resulting in controversial discussions .	-7.3439
The city prevented the lodging of asylum seekers by establishing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-8.8094
At that time , the decision was not uncontroversial in the community .	-3.4058
But above all , Freudenstadt ’ s Upper Mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interests back then .	-7.0613
He should be right .	-3.5403
The Luisenhotels group with director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it back to a house of the Three Star Plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-6.9035
The group has four houses with the city of Freude .	-2.8934
Two of them in Bad Bergzabeth and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.7716
They are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.8504
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it is clear how extensive renovation work will be carried out .	-5.6791
The floors were demolished , ceilings partly dismantled , old bathtubs from the rooms are removed .	-5.1502
The entire hotel building is a single construction site .	-2.2465
There is still much to be done by March .	-2.0506
" It is actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.9743
Everything should be renewed in black forest style .	-3.1389
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is reconstructed , new windows are installed .	-5.4754
Everything should be " close to the people " later , as Thomas Scherer expressed .	-4.1027
" We want to make a jewelry outside . "	-2.7547
Swimming pool , spa and a meeting room are all well equipped .	-3.6833
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but you already want to be at a higher level of downtown Scherer .	-6.7816
The Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , wants to see itself wide , explains Scherer .	-4.9449
Both individual holidaymakers , groups and businessmen will feel at home .	-4.3598
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Kruse have already led , so Scherer .	-3.9365
The views of the city were identical to those of the hotel group .	-3.5082
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.5362
Thomas Scherer does not want to make a precise decision about the level of investment .	-4.7146
Nearly less than a million euros , he calculates .	-2.5060
The exterior systems are also put on the forefront , which is already clearly visible .	-5.5664
A large terrace is created inside the courtyard , which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is public .	-3.9300
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudentown is a good market " .	-1.8541
Russian affair : US Special Entrepreneursors Ensign Grand Jury	-5.2439
In the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump , Special Entrepreneur Robert Mueller is to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-5.3397
In recent weeks , the Board has begun its work , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " on the basis of trusted persons .	-15.1644
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigation .	-3.6452
The CNN Sender reported that there were already initial submissions of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-2.8605
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of intervening specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-2.5587
He investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-3.2338
The investigation is supposed to focus on several men who have been in the election campaign as a Republican adviser .	-5.9130
According to reports , Mueller also took more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.4552
The Washington Post wrote a few weeks ago that the special broker , Trump , personally , had come to the fore and suggested that the president might have obstructed justice in the wake of the affair .	-6.1382
The main task of Grand Jurys is to investigate the evidence that has been presented in cases of crime and to decide whether to issue an appeal .	-6.4455
Therefore , Grand Jurys are also called Anklachers .	-5.6150
Usually , they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-3.0952
The process is always done behind closed doors .	-2.2600
The body can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor in order to invite people to intervene in oath .	-5.3670
According to the CNN sender , submissions have already been issued that are turning to the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-5.4178
People who participated in the meeting were asked to make a statement in the report .	-3.7492
They should also provide documents .	-1.4904
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisors and songson Jared Kushner , as well as his former campaign head Paul Manafort , were in the .	-4.6877
Legal experts said on Thursday , on US television , that the suggestion that Mueller should not be intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary .	-5.4936
But it should not be inevitable that the Grand Jury will end up being swapped up to decide on the charge .	-5.9451
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new cause for concern to President Trump .	-3.7414
In the midst of the new revelations , the president used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday to portray the Russian affair as his political opponents ’ campaign .	-4.5063
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-1.9602
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.3453
His special adviser , Ty Cobb , explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.4641
But they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-3.7601
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the specialist counsel in a ' fair ' way .	-3.4388
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that it is not against the president .	-3.5949
There is no reason to assume that this has changed , it was said in the statement . . the are . , , , , , , , , and , , ,	-9.8367
But Mueller was only used after Trump had fired Comey .	-7.4629
This draft smoking led to accusations against Trump of wanting to obstruct justice .	-3.9369
Comey said in June to a Senats-Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-4.3782
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.3497
Following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Representative and his staff .	-3.5649
The proceeded to speculate whether Trump would dismiss Mueller .	-4.1357
Unlike an independent congressional special broker , such as the Watergate affair around the later retired president , Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could , in theory , be taxed by the Ministry of Justice at the time of the president .	-5.8260
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.3919
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented legislative proposals on Thursday that the Special Representative could no longer be dismissed as easily as possible .	-4.2486
Antarctic : Gigantic Eisberg is driving in Antarctic .	-2.7635
In the Western Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg of Berlin ’ s barely seven-fold size has been resolved by the Schelfeis .	-10.4092
The Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegenerer Institute for Polar and Marine Research held on Wednesday .	-4.3784
The more than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of large pistons are now driving north and will probably need two or three years until it is melted .	-5.3973
The length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered in the past three decades .	-4.6611
He does not run the risk of people .	-3.2344
The extent to which climate change has played a part in the outbreak of the iceberg is unclear after research .	-4.4305
However , for around 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses in ice cubes in the region , writes the US research centre for snow and ice ( NSIDC ) in a factual background .	-4.7562
Many researchers believe that this can be linked to global warming .	-2.8509
The now broken pistos have been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-4.9922
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-4.1244
As a result , it keeps growing further into the sea and breaks regularly .	-5.3925
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is situated south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula .	-4.2712
The balance of growth and demolition a few years ago was disturbed in the Northern hemisphere .	-7.0143
A complete Schelfes had died there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-5.6932
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is also in danger of being in danger , because the front edge has never been so far removed as it .	-6.6791
In addition , the ice plate stands under tension and could fall if a key spot drops .	-4.6559
The melting of Shelfes and Eisberg does not increase the sea level because they are swimming on the water and pushing ice so much water as it does after melting itself .	-14.9539
However , the loss of the Schelfest will result in glaciers coming directly into the sea and moving much faster than before .	-6.2819
This could possibly increase sea levels , but only to a lesser extent , writes the British research project to monitor Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-4.8583
In accordance with AWI data , the Larsen-C Schelfeis is the fourth-largest Antarctic shotch with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-6.0936
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge of the free ocean around 200 metres .	-5.5070
It expires regularly .	-2.7103
" Although it is natural and there is no direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.8711
" This is the longest retreat since the beginning of the records , " he also confirmed .	-2.6384
Among scientists , whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is going to grow again or go back in the long term and perhaps fall together , his colleague , Adrian Luckman , added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-6.7259
But this development will take decades .	-1.9595
Although these researchers do not bring the breakdown of this gigantic iceberg back to climate change , in recent decades , many Antarctic glaciers have fallen apart .	-6.3954
This long Antarctica clash toward South America .	-3.4769
According to the research program British Antarctic Survey , the Antarctic Peninsula ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.4418
The drop in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-2.1667
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years and thus ranks among the areas where the temperature is soaring as quickly as possible .	-5.5238
CDU wants to pet with the staff .	-4.0842
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to fill freelance jobs , the CDU is calling for employers ’ union to become more attractive .	-6.1024
Only recently before the summer break , the Kreistag identified 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.9377
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the district administration in Mettmann .	-2.0468
17 trainees have once again entered their first working day .	-4.0174
Apparently , the teachers in the circle are highly sought .	-4.2825
Some 620 applications were available for the seats to be handed over this year .	-3.2688
However , there is still a need for more staff to cope with increased requirements and tasks .	-5.1903
Currently , there are still 50 non-occupied positions in the Mettmann circle .	-3.4227
Among other things , doctors and engineers are consulted and forces of general administration .	-3.5586
The CDU wants to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG in a round day to oppose the administrative shortage .	-5.9607
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept for personnel and personnel development .	-11.4179
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of professionals , but to counter the shortage of applicants in the future , it is to say .	-5.1437
The overall concept should be directed internally and externally , presenting concrete measures for horizontal entrants and including a training offensive , demanding CDU , FDP , and UWG .	-5.6631
It sounds like a good approach .	-2.9342
Because the circle has to deal with personnel problems that were not known earlier .	-5.6233
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.8579
The talk is of a genuine ' competition of public employers ' .	-3.8780
In addition , a large number of employees who emit illness or age depending on the service .	-5.5766
So it is high time to act so that more jobs are not left unoccupied .	-4.3406
But Klaus-Dieter peoples , the leader of the CDU , goes beyond his party ’ s joint motion .	-3.8726
He recently held a rotary surprise when he publicly questioned personnel costs and stunned other parties .	-7.0127
People want to see all the options that make it possible to leave the community employers ' association .	-5.1185
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution in the short term , the district administration with the unions - perhaps in cooperation with the towns involved - should aim for a pet , " said peoples .	-7.1835
The CDU is thus trying to better pay for employees and officials than it actually provides for public service pricing .	-5.5974
The salaries are currently accurately prescribed , increases or more money only when they change to a higher level that is geared to the working years .	-6.0991
But the circle ’ s responsibilities have grown more and more in recent years .	-2.8596
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees care about the provisions of the new anti-prostitution law .	-4.1862
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.5772
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats .	-3.8615
Italy warned NGOs using the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.9526
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-3.8589
Minnitis Warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German relief organisation ' Youth Livet ' , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.7446
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed allegations by the Italian Public Prosecutor , Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.3250
" For us , the rescuing of human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-4.7203
" We can only judge any allegations that are currently made after we have collected all the information and we can assess the situation " .	-5.4314
The Italian authorities had watched the boat of ' Youth Save ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.6536
It is suspected that its crew takes slaughter migrants on board , delivered directly by human traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be reused .	-6.2066
At least such a meeting was supposedly only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the prosecutor whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.5296
The occupation is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian coastguard , monitoring the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-4.2898
Under the Code of Conduct , boats such as Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who monitors their activities .	-4.5306
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.8571
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be deemed unnecessary but acceptable , because they would not entail ' major changes or obstacles ' to their bailouts .	-4.5389
Among those who refuse to sign is the Nobel laureate organisation physicians without limits ( MSF ) .	-3.1586
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the bailout in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-14.6555
" In the last few days , we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the Minister .	-2.6593
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.8447
Rising and Trials	-1.0846
Nine Weiler Biker , the " Berliner Outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the north path to enjoy four days of trials and sights .	-5.5464
There were three friendly guides available for this purpose .	-2.7649
The accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-3.6624
Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome addition .	-2.5503
The first tour led to the Michele Chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-4.6492
It was followed by viewpoints , partly on towers , of which one could look far beyond the pebbles and the upstream plains .	-7.2279
Meanwhile , there have been increasing numbers and rewards for the long trials .	-11.0748
The second day , after Bad Dürkheim , the saline market and the public sausage market went to the ground .	-5.7973
Again the viewpoint is ripe , connected by " floating " trials and moderate ascents .	-4.5891
On the last two days , many hills were again promised .	-4.9535
Lots of caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and castles brought to you .	-5.3093

Are the sports stars facing computer consoles in the future , instead of going to fight through the stadium during wind and weather ?	-6.6197
Fact is : e-sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with lots of fun .	-4.6597
This has also been recognized by the first Bundesliga companies , which are increasingly engaged in this area .	-4.0175
VfL Wolfsburg started in 2015 , later the FC Schalke 04 and last the VfB Stuttgart , which established an E-Sports Department in mid-July and signed two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game .	-6.4592
" We hope to inspire new target groups for the VfB , " says executive board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.8958
He is sure that ' there are still several clubs on this turn ' .	-4.3306
Next weekend , FIFA World Cup in London will host the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in which the gamers of various clubs compete .	-5.5963
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.9855

" The real football must focus in particular on the 14 to 30 years of age that young people continue to go into the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-7.4638
And : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian ones .	-3.1381
With prominent e-sportsmen under the contract , one could be online much more often present on these markets than just once a year to send the Bundesliga membership to Asia .	-5.8263
What exactly is it all about ?	-7.1145
In e-sport , computer games like " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " CounterStrike " , or the football simulation FIFA at competitive level are covered .	-10.2351
For a long time , as in normal sport , leagues have established themselves in which the professionals compete against each other .	-4.7496
And for the 2022 Asian games , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-3.4163
But is this a true sport ?	-2.9478
For many , the idea is certainly used .	-2.6206
Ingo Frobclear , too , has been dealing with the question for a long time .	-4.4951
For the professor at the German sports high school in Cologne , E-Sport is a sports because it is competent and shows many biological and physical responses that you can also find in classic sports - for example higher heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.5442
It also needs cognitive abilities , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast reaction capability .	-2.8117
Professional gamers should train not only from the console but also their body and take care of the diet .	-3.7517
" The fit player is a good player . "	-1.7936
Frog also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-5.0286

Players travel internationally , like a large global family , there are no intercultural obstacles .	-4.2243
A study of the Deloitte Corporate Advisory and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) suggests rapid growth in the field of e-Sport .	-5.8723
In 2016 , it had been translated into Germany for EUR 50 million , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments .	-4.5413
In three years , sales are expected to be 130 million .	-2.6280
This is not enough in relation to the EUR 2.4 billion allocated to the football budget .	-12.4964
However , E-Sport is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " Deloitte advisors write .	-4.8767
Many countries have already reached international level .	-1.6339

Hollywood actress Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports weather provider Unikrn .	-3.0214
There is something in Europe , too .	-2.9823
In a Norwegian school e-sport was introduced as a training compartment , Froboe says .	-4.0770
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , the first football club is now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-4.4473
" Germany lags behind in Europe , " explains VfB Board of Röttgermann .	-4.5457
Only in nostalgia to sink , and the old times to noise no longer suffice today .	-6.3619
It is a matter of preserving the association ’ s tradition , but at the same time it is aimed at the modern market .	-5.5301

Michelle Carter condemns suicide for the texts that urge Conrad Roy .	-3.7594
A woman from Massachusetts has been sentenced to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend to suicide by means of texts and calls .	-3.8476
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years being exposed to exposure . . the are . the are . . are .	-11.1459
Carter was sentenced in June for reckless killing by Conrad Roy , who took life on July 13 , 2014 .	-3.6034
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is undeniable .	-4.2876
My son was my best friend . "	-1.3282
Carter could remain free to appeal .	-2.1519
She had been faced with a penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy were suffering from mental illness .	-4.1528
Carter dressed in red trousers and a cream-colored bluse , with tears in the eyes , with aged hands and downward eyes , when convicted .	-6.5211
" Their actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-3.2076
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-2.2384
She did not take responsibility , " she said .	-2.3320
" She has not shown any revision " .	-3.4294
But Carter 's lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance , which it totally regrets ' .	-4.9210
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find that their " age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant impact on their actions " .	-3.4976
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is " no day on which I do not see the loss of my beloved son .	-12.1013
I would like him to be proud of me and how I go around with everything .	-4.1374
Roy ’ s sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " by the recognition that she would never take part in the wedding of her brother or a dance for his children .	-4.9157
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.9999
The case seems to set a legal precedent , because there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-3.3027
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-2.1784
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s textmessages revealed that she encouraged him to end his life .	-3.7203
" If you go , jump from a building , create yourself , I do not know there are many ways " , she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-6.2247
In the moments before his suicide they wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " Everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy " .	-3.9013
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for and ordered by Roy 's death that she should benefit from the case by any press .	-3.3200
The case has divided legal opinion .	-0.9522
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was sentenced to their British fellow citizens in Italy in 2007 , before being released two years ago .	-4.3591
Mrs Knox , 30 years of age , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and assistance , not prison ' .	-3.0088
Joshua Kimmich : Learn about the new Mini-Lahm of the FC Bayern	-2.8076
That Joshua Kimmich had to leave the Audi Cup as a captain is no accident .	-3.4027
The FC Bayern brackets the Confed-Cup Winner a big season - no extra-motivation .	-5.6978
Something else was different in his place in the cabin , that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even if the extra garment was very , very small .	-5.8923
But since far and wide on the second day of Audi Cups , of course , there was no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer , he made his commitment to the arm . . .	-12.6071
" The trainer did not announce it " , the Confed-Cup winner recalled it after his first assignment as Bayern captain .	-6.5737
Well , the lie could have gone better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.6980
But the character of the Coach could make Kimmich so clear .	-3.2955
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as the player , but as a player , the C-Elf , who was born of youth players , debutants , and specifically from the holidays .	-10.5578
The best way to distribute sugar is to those who want to keep much faith in whales .	-6.0126
Those who have been chosen to inherit the heritage of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-12.5985
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want to take responsibility " .	-3.5847
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old man flying over the field as Mini-Lahm .	-4.2710
To the right , this is his position , the white bond on the arm did its rest .	-3.4448
And there was a real kimming in this startup form like that that which can best take the rudder in hand .	-9.8886
He gave instructions , tried to guide the unplayed force .	-3.0042
He had the view for the whole while many others were occupied with themselves .	-4.7247
Vidal is playing out his lack of fitness ( flapping scarce ) ; Renato Sanches stopped riding on a devil 's trip to Asia ( stripping even for ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle so that , in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot , they won ’ t be negative .	-11.0434
That , after all , was a very good thing . .	-11.0003
Süle ran away from the defense , along with Kimmich , Rudy , both farming sovereign .	-6.3533
The renowned Napoli Sturm often did a lot of work , and Süle also tried to succeed in the development of the game .	-8.3675
His colleague , Mr Rudy , said that the result ' was not what we hoped for ' .	-4.2398
But he also showed a good performance in the debut .	-3.1528
Changing the game , changing it : " For this style I was also fetched " .	-6.1595
How uncertain this Bayern world is still for new entrants was seen after the game .	-5.3680
Rudy , for example , did not have one or two interviews in the catacombs , but determined six .	-4.4228
Kimmich waited for a few narrow statements at the back of his new fellow players .	-4.7552
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " I have already noticed what is being done here .	-4.4454
At Bayern you just have to win every game " .	-2.3678
After all , he must not bring the new .	-3.8646

Businesses satisfied with Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economy praises Wissing 's Tempo	-4.3246
It was often incomprehensible to have the relationship between the country and the regional economy , as Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-5.4898
This is more than a year after the new Economic Minister Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-4.2965
Chambers and companies from the region speak of T V 's question about changing economic policy - and , at the same time , challenge the old minister .	-5.4067
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing picks up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.6144
The biggest turning point is Natus in infrastructure policy : the gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now high in the country ’ s priority list .	-4.6439
This year , the Ministry hopes for a planning procedure , and by 2021 the construction law will be in place .	-5.0097
The West Brotherhood Trier also plays a role in the country ’ s plans , which is in the country ’ s urgent need for the Bundeswehr .	-7.4327
The aim is to get the race into operation in December 2020 , Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-4.3002
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competitive companies .	-3.7729
The Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier seeks , as suggested by Wissing , a Rhineland-Pfalz label in wine to raise sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been declining for ten years .	-5.5652
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company praises the IKHK .	-4.1189
The craftsmanship Trier sees the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schnalbach .	-4.4333
A premium of 1000 euros is planned for the occupant master exam and 2500 euros if graduates make themselves independent within ten years after the master training .	-7.1434
But the list of domestic tasks remains for a long time .	-3.3117
The planned road construction is quick to get facts , while at the same time it lacks the necessary staff , said Jan Glockauer , chief executive of the IHK Trier .	-7.4935
Of 56 new engineers that want to adjust Wissing in national mobility , only 29 posts have been filled .	-6.0113
The IHK requires more orders to be distributed to external offices .	-2.9086
Christian Baldigf 's CDU group vize refers to the Court of Auditors ' calculations that , in 2017 and 2018 , the country is investing more than EUR 20 million less in the maintenance of national roads than proposed .	-5.9142
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to overcome the technical shortage in the region .	-4.0252
What is more serious is the expansion of broadband in the country to date .	-3.8409
In 2016 , regional companies had only evaluated net supply in an IHK poll with the note 3.4 .	-3.5413
They complain about stoking Internet connections and abortion .	-2.4997
Ex-Minister Eveline Lemke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still sitting in the Supervisory Board of the Wind Power Company Pro Wind .	-4.8271
The Green Group left Lemke on April to become President of a private college in Karlsruhe , where after four months of disagreement it had already been cleared .	-10.8917
Audi is to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-3.2784
One day before Audi announced , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.8730
The BMW-Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles .	-4.9060
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce their diesel emissions .	-2.3380
None of the companies described the company as a callback .	-2.7118
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-3.1050
But the nitrogen oxides emitted diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.1612
The costs of car manufacturers to install equipment for the neutralisation of the exhaust gases extracted from diesel vehicles are also rising , which makes it difficult to keep the car competitive .	-14.5313
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of obscuring powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.4168
Companies are trying to avoid the mistakes made by Volkswagen , which could regulate emissions to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but in normal driving conditions .	-5.5546
Several Volkswagen employees have been charged in the United States , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-3.1521
Last month , former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-1.1862
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States .	-9.5383
At the beginning of this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations into Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent the emission regulations in Europe and a question focused on the United States has been expanded .	-5.2209
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could put Volkswagen hard on board : the luxury car manufacturer is disproportionately contributing to Volkswagen 's profits .	-4.6820
This message has the floor on Saturday at the Isar .	-9.7309
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-2.8874
In order to make the visitors of Isar also join , a flight passes through Munich tomorrow , which has a special message .	-6.1878
Once again on Saturday , the Isar will see a big storm between Flaucher and Reichenbach Bridge .	-6.4980
And this is not a common flow , with Isar tourists .	-2.7372
Special the Baufer will be informed .	-6.5630
There is a big infotraneconomical on the flow .	-4.6899
It shows a Müllberg .	-2.7223
The prelude to a publicity campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors .	-2.4823
The motto " True Love is ... " is to increase understanding of the Isar as a protective wild flow .	-3.3741
Last summer the river crossed the Isar and also this year there are further actions and measures to achieve good and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-5.2883
Mordillos Knollenasen and the Lasting Against the Loss	-5.6645
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most widely published cartoon drawings , the garlic names of his characters are his trademark .	-4.3772
With 85 , Argentineans are still standing and working on a film .	-4.3404
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.0443
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.8536
In the first years as an artist , he proposed himself , among other things , as a drawing on lucky cards - which frustrated him .	-6.5257
" The happy day in my professional life was the day when my job was lost , " he once said .	-2.3262
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in the end of the 1960s : the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.9922
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.2443
Time and again artists inspired by cities .	-2.9031
Large , rounded Mordillo figures tumble in drawings with the shale tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.0433
According to the early morning he is still sitting in the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.4031
Through calendars , puzzles , books for large and small , T-shirts , pleats and clocks , its drundy figures continue to be widely distributed worldwide .	-6.1753
He has also worked on a drawing film and a TV series with his characters for six years .	-3.6009
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos 's favorite animal in his drawings - who has a thousand feet as a player .	-5.0922
His characters speak for the first time in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema in 2019 .	-5.3647
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-1.8856
The script is not written by him .	-1.2722
This is why he relies more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is made without wordless .	-6.3514
Rising Lavenddel from the Provence of Climate Change	-3.8280
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.2707
Lavendel is falling because of the insect that is reminiscent of drought and because of illnesses , which causes major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.8063
Eric Chaisse , an expert of the CRIEPP agricultural research institute in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively threatened because the plant has been exposed in recent years to the effects of climate change , which has caused much less rain in the spring , and in the autumn much more .	-6.8669
This has an impact on the life span of Lavendel .	-3.1732
There is also a small Zikade , a microbacterium that transmits dwarf , and with very dry weather there are many of them . "	-5.3165
And there is a lot at stake .	-2.0130
Lave oil not only attracts tourists , it is also important for perfumes and cosmetics .	-4.0710
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long vegetable oars with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either failed or weakened .	-3.3228
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.7878
The solutions that are considered include improved water distribution and the slowdown of soil degradation , but also the existence of plants with a protective mix of sound and water and the development of varieties which are more resistant to drying .	-5.7655
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200 year existence .	-3.7113
Festivities are held this Saturday and Sunday with a medieval festival .	-4.3199
Herbs , breeds , traders , vagants or a land skeleton slaughter are to be seen in the city centre on these days .	-8.2721
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico .	-1.6128
The staff of the weekly Ricodoce usually meet on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and ongoing drug wars .	-6.5311
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.5217
They were told that it is important to change their routine .	-1.9981
Two senior journalists are discussing what is more secure : they are supposed to take their children into the office , which was the goal of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.1500
Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : Opponents , Neutrale , Allies .	-3.2605
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is needed , perceptions and construction feeling rich .	-4.5721
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the government ’ s paylist or cartels , a catalogue of criminals making Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-4.2629
There is no retreat from violence , and while suffering is accumulating throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are standing by attacks and threats under German security , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-7.3459
Among the latter , her editor and her inspiration from Riodoce , the co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.6757
" The greatest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " says Valdez in one of his numerous books on violence related to drugs .	-3.2996
His absence is deeply felt even though his presence is present everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " , depends on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-6.8119
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided themes , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-3.7365
Although a special and non-prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it has , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , initiated only two criminal proceedings .	-4.8431
As with most thousands of killings connected to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.0909
In the case of Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating Sinaloa 's violence , although they are indefensible , and although the terrain is now even more concise .	-7.8224
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little purpose , says Ibarra .	-2.8618
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.9320
" Until we know the Why , we all mistrust . "	-3.4545
On the morning of 15 May , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-4.0369
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was held by two men , forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him , presumably due to the name of the newspaper - which is translated by the " Tw" river .	-7.2284
The lady went out in his car and damaged it nearby .	-3.9847
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8004
He left a woman and two adult children .	-0.8713
All rumours tend to be completely cordial in Culiacan .	-3.8190
But there is virtually nothing but silence on Valdez .	-2.1553
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival groups are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.0842
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the street or that the graveyard is full of decorated , twin-story muzzles for drug queues larger than many homes for the living .	-7.0632
Forget for one minute that there is a state of tranquility if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-3.3813
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , was able to destroy the blame that he could not protect his friend .	-4.6636
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.4180
First , in February , there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartels in war with Guzman 's sons .	-10.6479
This release may have annoyed the sons , Gangmembers expected to buy each copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.4594
The second mistake was that Valdez should not be forced to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper that published the same story .	-4.3374
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and its killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.2269
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .	-1.9833
In 2003 he was an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $ 50 in investments .	-4.5332
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to practise journalism without sweeping the problem of smoking , " said Bojorquez .	-8.3084
Over time , the newspaper had a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising took place .	-4.6277
Reporters loved to be able to publish harsh studies without fear of censorship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else wanted to treat .	-3.8659
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce , she received the prestigious Maria-Moors-Cabot prize for her reporting in Latin America .	-3.3668
In the same year , Valdez won the Committee ' International Press Freedom Award ' for the protection of journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever it led .	-8.9817
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.6030
" I want to continue to live " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.5287
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said in an interview with Roma TV last October .	-3.3180
" You have to take the task that you have as a journalist - either that or you play the rubbish .	-5.1741
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was happening ? '	-3.3857
The Riodoce team missing Valdez , the scourge that could curse like a dock , the friend who was generous with circumference and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-5.9042
They kept on their routine .	-3.4223
He would always bear his hat .	-1.2895
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table there .	-3.3497
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his derangers ?	-3.3991
His death also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their job and to remain alive .	-3.7227
" You don 't like it when you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their homely starting- and land railways to get drugs .	-6.0025
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-1.8462
The result , even in the best times , is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-1.8370
Trust your own instincts .	-1.4565
If it is wrong , stay away .	-2.5472
The anger is , the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarireal said , ' Geruch is a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter has happened to Javier . '	-5.5040
The old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as they are in Tamunipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and others , where a poisonous mixture of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .	-5.5452
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.4520
In the space in which the Riodoce staff met for security training , phones were suddenly not allowed , and days before , it was known that spyware , which was sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-7.1388
Draussen sought two policemen protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree . . .	-10.6372
They were commissioned by the National Government to protect the offices of Ricodoce in a four-story building in a middle class quarter of Culiacan .	-4.2636
Half in the joke , some of the reporters questioned whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police who called the governor himself untrustworthy .	-4.7005
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountainous landscape where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-4.8214
For this week 's issue , Riodoce relied on three main stories .	-3.1093
There was the murder of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.6174
They also had an exposé on public spending concentrated on the hometown of the Governor .	-3.4843
And there was a group that carried out kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-3.3548
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so we were careful when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local drug-traffickers and authorities .	-4.5166
A reporter was told from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belonged to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century .	-5.8908
Recently several PRI governors have been accused of corruption for high-profile cases .	-2.8858
Villarireal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this locality , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-4.1171
Only a few months before , the readers would have considered the Column of Valdez as the most informed source of the kidnapping .	-4.1672
" We already knew what happened , " said Villarireal , 46 , with the nickname " El Floco " because of its sleek body stature .	-4.2427
" Now all channels of communication are broken down with our sources " .	-2.4296
The Valdez office was turned into a storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the killings of journalists , because the employees have become something they would never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.6671
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-4.8060
Salvador Adam disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.0307
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-3.1276
Journalists have become louder throughout the country , writing them in organized protests " SOS Press " on walkways and buildings .	-5.4360
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez .	-3.8562
In a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa , on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spurring journalists and relocating them because they said the truth .	-4.4049
Since then , she has asked for the government to be redirected because she is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-5.1276
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists were surrounded by organised crime in Mexico , by government officials involved and by an equal society .	-4.2475
In his last book , Narco Journalism , he wrote that reporters were killed not only by drug gangs , but also on orders of politicians and security forces that were under a ceiling with organised crime .	-4.5309
The Media Guardian Group " Articulo 19 " allocated more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants last year .	-4.2329
" In Mexico you stirry because you want to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-3.6180
Evidently , the killings have a deterrent effect .	-1.7331
No one forget the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamulipas six years ago .	-3.0545
Her body was found together with an note that was allegedly signed by the Zeta cartel : ' I am here because of my reports ' .	-4.3181
A computer stature and headphones located next to their separated head .	-3.7256
Some branches have chosen to close as the El Norte newspaper in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondent Miroslav Breach in March .	-3.1042
Others continue to do as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-3.5713
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with a title article entitled " What do you want from us ? " .	-5.0497
Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .	-2.0673
It is a painful decision .	-0.9619
It is difficult to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.6763
And sometimes they are chased , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-4.1519
For those who remain behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with risk-taking decisions .	-2.8480
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-3.4627
" Mexico goes hell , so I became reporter , " he said .	-2.1130
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Riodoce were sitting on the citizen 's slopes in front of the office and dropping beer as they all started to slam their phones .	-8.5750
A number of gunpowder foundries near the Mazatlan resort had left 19 confirmed dead .	-5.0693
The war escalated further , as promised by a number of cartels in the region .	-3.9641
From the Bordstein Cante you have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile .	-5.4267
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.3324
Sirenen met in the vicinity - another rogue in the area .	-5.3523
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who watched to see if they were willing .	-2.9396
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-3.5178
Under the enormous portrait of the dazzling founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible for the whole of Sinaloa , the staff of Riodoce followed his footsteps .	-6.8073
" How can you only remember this , " said Bojorquez , " if on the same day as Javier was murdered , the internant asked me to send them to the street to report . "	-5.7454
Dinosaurier used the camouflage to cast out his enemies .	-9.5717
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening .	-2.2404
Now researchers have found that the first insights of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker were received so well that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurier " .	-5.2774
It was received so well that they could even find that its glorious skin was of reddish brine - and they said it had had had something of a " restless past " .	-6.3379
The report in the ' Current Biology ' magazine called it ' the best preserved pan-European dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur specimens in the world ' .	-4.7617
The Fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaurier that lived between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the chalk period .	-4.6735
His unbelievably good state of affairs has amazed researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-3.9769
According to reports in National Geographic , the vegetable freeser that is best preserved is the fossil of its kind .	-5.1584
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.7895
He met something that seemed to be missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.3645
Fossil 's discovery was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.4245
They spent the next six years exploring the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) severe global clumps .	-4.9047
After all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .	-2.2787
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature can see .	-5.7463
" It will enter the history of science as one of the best preserved dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriere " .	-3.9531
Researchers have found that although this plant freeser is covered with a armor and resembles a changing tank , it was probably threatened by carnivorous dinosaurs .	-6.5995
The highly panced dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predators , and used a distillation technique known as counter-attack used by many modern animals .	-5.9694
This would have allowed itself to be better interfered in its surroundings and depart from its enemies , say experts , indicating that it was threatened by major dinosaurs .	-5.8143
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now on the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-4.0269
Researchers have studied the wild animal and have called Borealopelta markmitchelli to the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours covering it carefully .	-5.5666
Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists , the pattern and the shape of scales and armor over his body were able to document the stunning preservation of the copy .	-6.4011
They discovered the consternation , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than its base .	-8.3074
Although the consternation is customary , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds those of today 's animals .	-3.9150
There are indications that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from meat to consume dinosaurs , that Evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival .	-5.3646
But most of the contemporary animals that use consternation - think of Ree , Zebras , or Gürtel-animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signifies that this nodosauer was exposed to a real battle for survival .	-7.4518
" Starkes predatory behaviour on a massive , highly panced dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the creed era have been , " said Brown .	-6.1894
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was redbrown .	-1.9812
Scientists continue to study the animal on evidence of his life , including his conservative content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-5.2906
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was caught in a river and carried out to the sea , where he sank on the back to the .	-5.0371
At that time Alberta was as warm as southern florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-3.1251
" This nodosauer is truly remarkable , because it is fully covered with a conservative , scaly skin , but also remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-5.5972
" The result is that the animal looks almost as it was in the early period of drawing .	-3.8947
You don 't need much imagination to reconstruct it , if you just shoot a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that he is sleeping ' .	-5.4643
The period of creation was a time when giant theropods , blue-roasted dinosaur , which stood on two legs , took the earth through .	-7.8611
Although the king of them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years to Borealopelta , the panned dinosaur was driven by some of his frightening ancestors .	-3.9919
This includes acrocanithosaur , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-4.1221
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was deceived after death in the sea and mummed in the mud .	-5.4683
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.1308
According to the museum , it is the best preserved panced dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the barrels to the hips .	-4.9572
The creatures were average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-4.0358
It contained two 20-inch long leaders demanding by his shoulders .	-3.8642
The researchers believe that the spurred plant freezer was swamped by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it to the open sea .	-5.1296
But the underwater treatment of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.7945
The accumulated remnants of this special specimen are received so well that the skin remains still covered wooden pan plates along the dinosaurs .	-6.0731
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such conservation level is as rare as winning the lotto .	-4.3266
The more I see it , the more confusing it becomes .	-2.0940
Aucted remnants of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the animal 's skull .	-4.8495
His right is on his side , his five fingers are poised upwards .	-3.4267
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-2.6678
Incidentally : Mass Carambolage on A8 : Many injured	-4.2899
There is a constant accident on Thursday at the A8 : Knapp 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambulage .	-4.9396
There are numerous injuries , kilometres long and loads .	-4.5333
About 20 people were injured in mass carambolage on the motorway Stuttgart München ( A8 ) in the late Thursday afternoon .	-4.9557
According to the police , at 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg district ) and a thunderstorm , about 30 vehicles , probably also lorries , were not shipped .	-9.3877
First of all there was no indication of the precise number of casualties .	-3.6903
It is about light to medium sized injuries , a police spokesperson said .	-4.5158
A major increase in the number of bailouts was in the accident .	-4.8181
The A8 was completely closed to Munich .	-2.1401
A further ten-kilometre long rear log was built in Munich ’ s direction . .	-13.0587
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive obstacles in the counter-road - through numerous loads .	-5.7493
The fire fighters noted the characteristics of drivers who are now facing sensitive penalties .	-5.7356
Shortly after 6.45 p.m. there was a second accident at the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-3.2687
There was a collision between a car transport and a car .	-4.3940
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .	-2.2690
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in " .	-2.3505
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing you sit in the train and sleep in a stranger .	-5.1553
Or you are immersed in his work and have a really good idea .	-4.2734
And then : pufff .	-2.2097
When the Schaffner arrives and wake up an unsant or leaves the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-7.0503
Tax ticket control .	-2.3197
But the era of interruptions is over .	-2.7163
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the chaotic ticket control .	-5.1960
One simply confirms by mobile that you take your place and value the ticket .	-4.4094
A test operation is currently running on two tracks .	-2.3741
" If the offer is available , we extend it .	-2.6406
It will probably be available on many other route routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a rail slider .	-10.1358
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train a ticket devaluation without Schaffner .	-4.4462
In order to be able to use them , however , a number of conditions have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.4110
And you have to book an online ticket , which is what most passengers already do .	-4.6743
You also have to buy it via the App of the Bahn , the DB Navigator , which is the most convenient way of booking the ticket .	-4.9878
Last but not least , there is a need for seat reservations .	-7.7101
Because " Comfort Check-in " works as such : you climb the train , calls your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-5.5407
A button for electronic devaluation will appear for the test customers .	-3.4684
The train attendants get a message to their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has taken the booked seat Y .	-4.7654
When the train attendant arrives at the ticket control point Y he knows there is a passenger with an already valuable online ticket .	-6.9776
So you can sleep further , work further , keep quiet .	-3.9840
" Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should be used for passengers .	-4.8461
" If you want to travel by train , you can easily check in the DB Navigator .	-5.5185
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time in the train , " says Michael Peterson , the management of the marketing of DB distance transport .	-5.6526
Second Plus : " And our employees have more time than they are today to respond to individual customer requirements " .	-2.8913
If you travel often on a train , you know that in addition to late trains , ticket controls are among the biggest problems .	-7.2353
It is often the case that one of the passengers does not have all the documents needed to evaluate online tickets .	-5.9240
Either the credit card or personal card is missing or any other document you need to provide .	-5.0005
The result is endless discussions between train and passenger , resulting in poor mood in the gap or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and , in the end , the Schaffner takes time to take care of other concerns .	-6.7780
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-2.3886
And this also only applies to ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart Essen .	-4.2326
Further numbers on the same route are not unlocked .	-3.7731
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' What Streets ? '	-2.3916
On 9 August 2014 , Britany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-2.2546
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the one in St. Louis Geburne was on the bed of a Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled by Facebook on her phone .	-6.3350
She stumbled over a post from someone in the High School .	-2.9763
" The police killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " it said .	-3.8226
Confuses because no one else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.3884
A user with the Handle @ TheePharoah was permanently on her timeline .	-3.2070
The rapper from St. Louis was killed live by Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old man killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-3.4106
He posted an image of browns living body that was exposed on the street and remained there four hours .	-4.6636
" That is indeed wild , " Ferrell thought himself .	-3.9019
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.4640
She put her cell phone off to return to tweets about people on the Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-3.4802
There were photos of the police and people who wrote , and by a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who was a shield with the record : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-4.6513
She observed a live feed , in which a policeman was sitting in front of a group of protesters with a beautiful dog .	-4.9849
In another video , she said , revealed another policeman his gun and cried : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-3.9905
" This is not customary , " Ferrell reminded her of her statement .	-3.2832
" This is not the kind of murder to which we have become accustomed and which we can call typical " .	-4.4518
At this moment I felt a joke .	-2.8141
I was angry and weite . '	-1.9439
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.7751
After landing at 23 a.m. , she took her 6-year daughter from her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-5.0540
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson during the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film , " What Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11th .	-4.2072
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people who live in the Community and have filled the roads to demand answers .	-4.1584
As a Ferrell with her daughter who wear a flower dress and a fitting krone , went to Ferguson , the two discussed a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning » about the black experience and black state « .	-12.7345
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " they reminded themselves of what they said .	-4.1399
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.0624
I could not take it " , Ferrell later said .	-2.6008
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.0320
They need to know it and see it and be drawn up .	-9.3090
It needs to be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to free ourselves .	-4.2146
Although I am fortunate to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience flagrant racism , she is not different from the next black woman 's child .	-4.3544
I feel I would give her a bad service to keep her off . '	-3.9523
The first station in Ferguson was located at the South Florissant Road , a place in front of the police authority , which became a camp when activists were waiting for the possible non-charge of Officers Darren Wilson .	-6.2783
There , Ferrell and her daughter connected with a local owner who made lunch .	-3.8752
They prepared bags and helped them pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.2828
Slowly , a new type of activism for Ferrell Gest started to accept .	-3.5356
" My activism changed completely after 9 August " , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St , Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association , concentrating on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.1057
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.6956
It all came . '	-3.0503
Weekly later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-3.0210
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar wanted only " document " what happened .	-3.6760
A question came from Ferrell : " Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? "	-4.3522
This skepticism has been nourished by innumerable cases of people , often White - in a community that has benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.8819
As Folayan recently said in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and grown up in Ferguson did not center their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.7114
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism around Death Tract Insmen .	-4.7536
Ferrell 's commitment brought the project closer , together with six other locals , followed the team of " Who Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-4.9617
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us .	-2.8410
" That was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because that is how I will be represented . "	-4.4002
The goal was not to focus on Ferrel 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participants in the film .	-5.5637
As a result , documents from " Which Streets ? " show surprising personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marry her wife .	-3.7873
" I felt like naked " , Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.1165
" But I understood that there needs to be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people . "	-3.3405
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story reiterates the role of black gay women in the broader BlackLives-Matter movement .	-3.9710
Two of the three founders of the movement , who , following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , marked the film " BlacklivesMat" in social media , find themselves gay .	-5.5898
" Black , gay women in management positions have borne the movement overall , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-3.9678
Black , gay women have to bear the burden of everything . '	-2.1673
Folayan agreed to say that " the movement is really maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.3975
However , she insists that " this is not an affiratory type of action " where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-4.6929
" She was the person who puzzled this energy , " she said .	-8.0026
" It is no coincidence , although it was at the front of the front , because a life on these crossings is a black , gay woman so much at stake .	-4.7642
You can feel their energy through the screen " .	-2.2992
In the meantime , the television cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial links between the municipality and the police continue to exist .	-4.3251
Ferrell is on tenement for 2 <unk> years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.5865
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A Chaos " .	-3.8844
However , she takes care of a vocation and she feels obliged to this memory since she was on the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-4.8623
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.7734
It is our duty to win .	-0.8233
We must love and support each other .	-0.8190
We have nothing to lose - except our chains ' .	-1.5948
From " Dream " to " Size Flag " : TV readers discuss bit-gallery .	-4.9178
The bit-gallery moves people even though it is not yet built .	-3.1098
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone has divided the population in supporters and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-4.1535
The issue has little to be calmed up .	-5.5155
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volkswagen Bitburg " .	-3.4579
While some say to the bit-gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be nice class " ( Nicole Shosters ) , the other side comes from : " Don 't have a person " ( Siggi Betzen ) or simply : " Gruschenwahn ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-7.9933
While advocates are building a gallery attracting more clients to the city , while the other business benefits , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding .	-5.6718
In addition , the gallery is planned on the very estate where the farm market hall stands , where 13 direct marketing companies offer their products .	-5.9225
It will stop at the beginning of the construction work .	-3.6163
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall in the new building - for the Beda Square with the possibility of sitting out .	-5.2538
Simone Rooms : " We have been purchasing in the farmhouse for many years almost weekly .	-3.4271
Our eggs and the delicious cakes of the farmer are always happy .	-5.0922
We have also discovered the butcheries for us .	-10.4219
We would like to see this offer maintained even during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-4.0567
In other cities , that is what is happening .	-3.5395
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . "	-3.1971
Gerd Densing : " Whether a direct marketing company is located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of the rental is on .	-6.1934
But it should not be very low in the new project . '	-9.2276
Eva Kilic : " Why Shopping Palace in Bitburg ?	-2.8260
Whether clothing , shoes , drug products or supermarkets , I find this superfluous .	-3.2647
There is enough of that in our city .	-2.6717
You can see how many shops here are empty - some for months and years .	-3.4612
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we should at least maintain the market hall .	-4.6320
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mainly offered by the producer and are also inexpensive . . are . are . are . . are . . are .	-10.1320
As you can see , shop shops are only registered by major companies in a shopping center , because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-4.9730
Shade , special business almost no longer exists and what remains of it will probably disappear . '	-5.5813
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together .	-2.4679
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.7518
Above all , where should the farmer market hall go during the construction time ?	-4.1313
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the bit-gallery actually comes into effect .	-7.8311
Or does the Gespenst Bit gallery already manage to distribute all the business of Bitburg ? "	-4.4763
George Marquet : " It will simply not work .	-1.6822
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.8918
I think it would have been better to promote a real agricultural market rather than this gallery .	-2.6315
But for a farm market hall , it is thanks to the insane number of construction projects - I think - in Bitburg that are meaningless .	-7.0442
When the farmers ' market hall is broken , another piece of culture will disappear . '	-3.6891
A fitting similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannnings DNA .	-2.7086
In the middle of the room of Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , almost uncomfortable - hanging at cables from the ceiling .	-5.4031
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wannen-Tupfern and Haarkarten , who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-6.2036
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst had a 35-year sentence after making public diplomatic messages about the WikiLeaks website as classified .	-7.0450
The new exhibition opened on August 2 is called A Becoming Rememblance ( a fitting similarity ) .	-3.3932
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline unites its expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and Manning , a Transwoman , and leading dissident whose condemnation was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-6.1395
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the harsh determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-5.0023
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has been openly talking about identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted of 20 charges in 2013 , including six violations of the Spionage law , computer fraud and theft .	-5.4213
Their image was suppressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photograph - a grainy black and white Selfie , in which man clearly sits on a driver 's seat and bears a platinum piece - with which she was associated .	-7.6467
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Strange Visions ' .	-3.1005
In this , the artist made portraits of foreign artefacts such as cigarette dumplings and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce an image of how these people could look .	-5.6300
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.7879
" They conducted an interview with Chelsea Manring , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-4.2630
And she could not visit at this time and she could not be photographed , so contact Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.6952
The artist and her imprisoned muse have been turned into unequal letters , which , over the course of two years , shared several letters .	-6.4536
They even created a Comic " Suppresed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelseas 's judgment would be transformed and able to see the exhibition personally .	-6.2340
The fact that Obama would , in fact , just a few days after the book was published , demand for Mannning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome type of happy meeting .	-5.8554
There is also now a little depressing and strong in the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against officials from the government camp and against transcender troops to find new , twisted ways to further flip the rigid divisions he should actually resolve .	-8.6134
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked for the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a given reason " .	-2.7927
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called , with her large signature , including ( the " i " in her family name is attached to a heart ) , an end to the " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which was gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-6.6405
On the opposite wall , its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-4.2865
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how astonishingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-2.9044
" What people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also visible .	-4.5154
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these stories are 30 . "	-2.6925
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own space , is a page from the aforementioned comic novel .	-4.4619
She shows Manning how she appeared with a freeman in her hand out of the disciplines ’ coffers in the United States like King Kong .	-6.9467
" If you cold your speech , you won , " it means .	-3.7895
So never stop the mouth .	-1.5438
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist greeted from Philadelphia .	-2.3402
" I still get gardening when I talk about it . "	-3.8023
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do so , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by their own genomic simulators , which , like Horden , are raging together by protesters .	-7.6069
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 " manning stature ) , in which their genetic plotting groups were written with pencil .	-6.2961
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd " , said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits .	-3.0340
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was behind its liberation . "	-3.3011
Professor of the University of Northwest and an employee at Oxford for murder	-7.7348
A nationwide human hunting is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University who are being sought as suspects after a man was killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with lethal injuries .	-6.0345
On Monday , for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants for murder were issued for their supposed participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau as shown by the acts of the court of Cook County .	-4.7805
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several digits .	-2.1674
A Community warning system published by the Chicago Police Authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-4.1889
Officials received a call , arrived at Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with multiple injuries on his body .	-3.8048
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead at the place of events , and Detektive investigate the keys as murder , while the police actively searches for the two suspects , said officials .	-4.4338
Latehem has been an extraordinary Professor of Microbiology and Immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-3.0688
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice President for University Relations , said in an e-mail declaration that Lathem was now considered and excluded from the Campus of Northwestern University .	-12.9052
" This is now a criminal matter under investigation by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbade .	-3.7924
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at Oxford University .	-2.8116
A university spokesman and Somerville College said in an e-mail declaration that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in any way possible ' .	-4.5011
The statement added that Warren 's colleagues were shocked and would like him to stand .	-4.0348
Chief Communications Officer of the Police Authority of Chicago , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urge the suspects to stand up to the authorities .	-3.5653
" The police have an idea of their place of residence and our efforts to locate them strengthen themselves " , Guglielmi said .	-3.5919
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects .	-1.8001
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the property manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who just received a puzzling tip saying that something happened in Apartment 1008 .	-11.7154
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9221
Guglielmi said that it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.1653
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-3.3408
" We believe Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship " , Guglielmi said .	-2.0696
The management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and investigates a variety of motifs , including a possible domestic event . "	-5.6868
" We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future " - the Russian Vice-President Mutko .	-2.6156
The Russian Vice-President Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.1680
" At a certain stage in meeting the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with KAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.9210
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.0256
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code that described the criteria for the re-establishment of RUSADA and recently published on the site of the organization .	-4.5825
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia .	-3.0813
" Everything was announced , everything is being implemented .	-1.9667
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.6364
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian Attorney Richard McLaren to alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.2180
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : " We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has found a mistake .	-3.8880
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.1331
But there were no state programs , and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.8473
Mutkos ’ words coincided with those of Vitalys Smirnov , the leader of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-3.1696
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov raised problems in the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-5.6523
Nobody has proposed to accept this report unconditionally ' , Smirnov added .	-4.0780
RUSADA was ruled out from the WADA in November 2015 , following the Doping scandal .	-12.1321
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.8991
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director Olivier Niggli said that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be used again .	-11.6226
Aldi no longer sells eggs	-3.1741
That is what the business groups shared .	-3.3344
It would be a mere precaution to ensure that no health impairment can continue to be affected by the communication .	-7.3425
Only eggs are now being delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested in a negative way on fibre fibre antisile .	-8.1999
Aldi wanted to make clarity and transparency with its customers .	-3.0042

Amy Erratt wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce startup , but the surveys did not work .	-3.4949
Answers were often vague , little helpful , or , even worse , fraudulent .	-2.9668
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.6340
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Ertt , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .	-3.6693
She has called people from outside for help .	-2.1446
A new race of human resources startups is on the increase to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.7757
By creating and validating software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to address specific groups and demographic groups , to offer anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases whistleblowers to bypass the C suite executives and direct contact the board .	-6.1833
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit to track their health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start up Glinn , whose software analytics tools used by companies to measure commitment .	-5.3408
Erratt said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel gained with Glinn in the three years .	-4.7778
In addition to the snap-surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a hitch map of the company that shows at a glance what units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can track why .	-6.1814
Companies come to realise that job culture must remain at the top , so that you do not become the next resource involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment to those who have spoken .	-15.0856
This desire for an overview of lucrative business is a welcome opportunity for startup ups such as Gl.	-5.1069
Global governance , regulation , and compliance industry could hold more than $ 118,7 billion in 2020 , according to the Lit 's Talk Payments financial website .	-4.9095
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw a rising interest and activity in discredit at the beginning of this year in the middle of the Uber-everything .	-4.9449
Convercent has nearly 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-2.2229
Uber has recently registered as an client .	-2.5778
Like Glindent , Convercent companies can send customised Puls- surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-6.1391
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.3025
And if the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.0565
" The public opinion court captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Concentre .	-4.7805
When a company is found which treats its employees badly or is unethical , it may experience costly consequences from consumer boycott , worker fluctuations and complaints , Quinlan said .	-5.2459
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 locations , has used Concentre for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way of reaching their corporate center .	-5.7777
In the past , if a employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the company ’ s central bank , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-5.0710
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to prosecute the complaints of employees .	-3.6451
Now that the company Convercent uses , problems previously hidden by executives in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice .	-6.1969
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360 degree view of employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group at Ruby Tuesday .	-4.5246
'And we protect our shareholders from employment and legal disputes ' .	-3.1560
Companies began to take more seriously the ethics , values , and staff in 2002 after the accounting Firm Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical infringements by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-4.9634
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .	-3.3574
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-2.1591
Both Glinn and Convercent offer your software as a service and charge companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-4.6243
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of venture capital investors , both of whom have supported startups .	-3.6610
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February by firms such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-4.2671
Glitzern secured $ 10 million in November from Better Venture Partners , bringing all funding to $ 60 million .	-4.3320
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.2783
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done .	-4.8418
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only records .	-7.2604
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.5481
" When people are happy to feel in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company succeed , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employe Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Concentre and Gllink .	-5.8733
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and businesses run well when employees are committed and committed .	-4.4553
If the Analytics tools of third parties promise to increase their commitment and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.8153
The data about employee engagement according to experts in job culture is important .	-3.9527
But the data will be useless if a company 's managers do not take action .	-3.5657
Indeed , if a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way .	-3.5612
And if change does not come fast enough , or at all , it can raise disappointments and discourage employees .	-4.5418
" If you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have left too much of data collection .	-4.9405
" For if you don 't follow employees ask themselves , " Did you really hear me ?	-3.4143
Is this what you are looking for ?	-1.9964
And who you do not care about it , why should I ? ' ?	-4.1868
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , has been able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glinn , so Ertt .	-5.4891
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems by speed of decision making and the quality of communication .	-5.4803
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into its employees , and it is hoping that in the long term this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.4994
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.8797
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.6267
And if you lose clients , you will lose companies .	-1.8139
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-3.9666
It goes to 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA football players talk on one side of the team 's new training fields at the campus .	-6.7213
Some have outstretched their trioco components and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training session .	-4.9937
For a good part of the team these irrelevant minutes are a lunch break .	-3.5856
Players engaged in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Water Man Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 .	-4.5173
" This is a true tree-mill for the boys the next three days , " said Bruin-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before the Tuesday .	-4.9632
NCAA will eliminate two day exercises to facilitate the load of players , and it has actually extended their days - at least to the final on Friday .	-4.7337
Therefore , the first three training courses of the UCLA should begin at 19 : 15 to meet the players ’ already packed timetables .	-4.8646
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season , and during the summer school the first time during six seasons in Westwood practiced training .	-5.9307
In the course of August , they will discontinue 18 exercises , 20 before the start of formal preparations for their action against Texas A & M in September .	-6.0267
Mora said he would support the NCAA ’ s rule change , even if it added another point to the players ’ multiplied routes .	-5.6810
" We place this huge burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.6780
" And they simply pressed it , they spill on , they are great people .	-4.3445
I think that as soon as we reach the Saturday and we have more time , it will really great . '	-4.5774
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which , in view of the clear lines of its fields , will not be an easy task , given the clear view of its fields , a adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of high class , which has already been advertised with footballs , which will provide a safety net behind a gateway .	-9.4179
Bruin players are expected to occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-5.2438
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.8479
" This is a real problem , and it is not a long time to think that people are renting a room there and are looking to record an exercise there .	-6.2689
If you have the video band from an exercise , it 's a pretty good deal .	-2.6418
But we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.2638
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.7340
I am therefore not very concerned about this .	-3.3740
We have a plan . '	-0.8528
Facebook wants to intensify face-assessment in the fight against counterfeit messages .	-3.9272
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third party auditors and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday .	-5.1888
In an opinion on its website , the company said that it will start using updated online learning methods to recognize possible false reports and send them to factual auditors who may be showing the results of the factual test from the original article .	-7.1630
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .	-4.0992
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings , as before the September elections .	-4.8530
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in English that a test of the new factual review will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.4538
" In addition to the recognition of the stories of factual auditors of third parties , people want more context to make informed choices about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-5.1528
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages .	-4.4129
Creating a Comic Romans : A Castle in the History of England	-1.8129
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.8587
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cosy seat in the Indoor River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphic novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mosphaic Yorkshire with a preference for historical documents .	-6.2461
" I think it is so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says brave .	-4.9640
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand " .	-2.4526
" A Castle in England " spreads the age from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documented the families who lived in Scotney , and each story was illustrated by another British artist - Isaac Lenkiewicz , Briony May Smith , William Exley , Becky Palmer and IsGreenberg .	-6.1800
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly emotionally found .	-3.2116
" I only reacted to the constant print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 's working for the Jacobins , " he says .	-5.5468
" That is their permanent imprint !	-3.1144
And letters always smell of smoke , because at that time one bred a fire because of the light .	-5.7813
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were .	-3.2747
Oh , I love Archive ! '	-1.2958
For someone who is beaten with old papers , that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued my welcome " ) this seems all too nice to be true .	-5.7832
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , passing through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the moneyed hyene heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .	-6.0921
He travelled through the grounds and the ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscape walkers , gardeners and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-4.8443
Then , at night he trank " whiskey and started writing " .	-2.2636
Scotney 's intimate history is relatively unknown , as the National Trust gained full access only in 2006 , when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-10.5357
When Rhodes entered a decade later , the employees began just with care of the archive that he described as " hundreds of years of years in which Aristocrats said " Oh , were they on the roof floor " .	-7.4286
Tageücher , briefing from the time of English Empire , maps that represent who possessed : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-5.8028
Young , let everything go his way ! '	-2.7814
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to enter the English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labour ' , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farmhouse of 1381 .	-5.6485
" There is a record of a rebirth in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knighly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-4.9679
" The peasant began in this area and I thought that an insurgency was a good start .	-3.3237
Perhaps the two are interconnected ? '	-1.7278
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit Father , who hidden the Darrell family for seven years in English reform .	-4.1443
Or ' The Smuggler ' , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell is portrayed from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( an discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was digged ) .	-6.6100
The Darrels are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : " Mens seemed to be pretty Gauners , repeatedly making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-5.7739
Other generations of Darrell men unleashed their debt crises by married wealthy old women - I imagine them as a pile of well outgoing boys , with a talent to advertise inheritance . "	-6.1539
Following the end of his mission in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.2401
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elehematäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature .	-6.2646
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.4381
" I was sad to go back , " he says .	-1.1248
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to get back to the dammed life ' .	-4.5306
Campaign starts : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf masks out .	-3.8752
With the revelation of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to launch a new roof mark ( Thursday 's tour ) .	-5.2388
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .	-2.4787
At the end of August , there is to be a feast on the island of Graftenwerth .	-4.1230
" Too nice for us .	-1.7792
Or ? " the masters of the action since yesterday ask at the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-4.6348
" We don 't think this ( of course ) really , " they write on their website released yesterday .	-3.4857
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.3240
And to make it clear that some things are better than they seem .	-2.2709
Basically , we are firmly convinced that as Bad Honnefer citizens we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.3619
The action goes for more than " a logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-4.0521
" It is necessary to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature " .	-5.4321
Finally , they compete with other communities .	-2.4082
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new umbrella brand and the campaign a mid-digit amount .	-5.5777
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s fear of the army	-2.2169
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises about boarding and carriage in the Official Scorpion .	-6.3395
That , too , this week .	-2.2526
At first glance , a normal operation .	-2.7435
But nothing is routine to the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.1503
The sitting was no longer held in the Generals ' building , as it was in the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.6846
During the proceedings under the Presidency of the Heads of Government , the five Vice-Presidents and the ministers for defence , home affairs , justice and foreign affairs also took part in the discussions .	-5.6321
As a result , the civilians in the YAS were in great numbers .	-3.7678
The government is taking the reins in the military .	-2.4596
The Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office , but the commanders of the army , the Air Force , and the Marine were dismissed .	-4.8069
Since the failed coup , head of state , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-4.4598
More than 10,000 troops have been removed from the army 's ranks - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the prelude , Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as the leader of the coup attempt .	-7.1076
We have been negotiating against 486 people who should have been directly involved in the coup attempt since this week in Ankara .	-3.3210
Even the day after the coup , Erdogan called the " godgink " because he gives him the opportunity to clean the armed forces " in full .	-6.8331
But has Erdo<unk>an really got a grip on the army ?	-2.2783
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-4.1553
On a general level , there are concerns about increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which manifest itself , among other things , in lifting the ban on soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-5.3884
In any case , the mass cleansing of the army and the security forces continues .	-3.1360
In July , Erdo<unk>an was fired by decree by another 7395 official , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-5.1433
It seemed as if Erdogan tamed the military .	-2.9208
The generals used to be the actual masters of the country .	-1.7092
Three times , they resorted to their role as guardians of the secular state order .	-3.4973
After his election victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the military ’ s power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform priorities .	-4.5893
Former officers say that Erdogan is targeting Islamisation of the armed forces .	-2.8931
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a specifically unnamed officer who sought the coup for fear of persecution abroad to seek asylum , the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time .	-5.7261
If that were true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-4.0898
Oh yes , there are doubts in the alliance following the cleansing of the Turkish army ’ s readiness to use .	-4.9753
The leadership structures and operational abilities are " weakened " , say Nato diplomats .	-3.3073
Washington changes the Green Card rules .	-2.2190
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.5135
It provides for lower legal immigrants to 50,000 a year , tighter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-4.2131
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-7.8557
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-1.8711
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , and save billions of dollars on taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way Green Cards are spent on citizens from other countries . "	-4.0983
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.2524
This new application procedure will benefit candidates speaking English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-4.2432
Ministry wants to redesign the race track .	-3.6614
Over the past few months , the future of the race 's starch hut has been contested - now it is going very quickly .	-8.4213
It is planned to be built by the end of the year on the road that runs the tourist track .	-5.6213
In order to secure the future of the race ’ s hut in the long term , construction works are to begin this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .	-5.5160
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the Ilmenau-Racetrig route , the country pleads to this important link , particularly for tourism , " declared Minister of Transport Klaus Sühl , on Friday in Erfurt .	-7.1622
The cost of the fleet repair was around EUR 2.5 million .	-3.6323
Of this sum , the country exceeds 75 % .	-2.8480
The treaty , on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in the future , is being finalised at the moment , said sweeter .	-6.5106
The Ministry and the South Thuringia Bahn as operator are already in agreement on the technical details .	-4.2660
" The road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated " said sweeter .	-4.8474
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be closed for 11 years .	-3.4066
This should be regulated by the race steam shuttle on December 2017 .	-5.7179
The race speed shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau railway stations and race steig , especially for tourists .	-6.4819
In the course of a pilot operation , the course has been tested over the past few months , whether the distance is used by a sufficient number of people to order them regular in the future .	-7.2924
The route is also in parts highly build-up .	-5.5820
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned about it .	-1.6106
Just when you thought that 2017 cannot be allowed to become even more crazy , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes in .	-5.9423
Yes , in fact .	-1.0948
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-2.1642
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .	-2.9735
According to Noel Sharkey , a professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-4.0379
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast warning and the type of fingernails .	-3.4915
" People are funny about it , but companies are delivering a lot of it , and we will get them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-6.1845
Modern sex puppies have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-4.4447
The user can also customize his robot according to his convictions , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the form of breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.3205
But it becomes even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that a Stepford-woman would look progressive .	-3.6484
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.5487
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing , such as chicken .	-4.8209
And then there are the Roxxxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with preprogrammed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of humidity and " Wild Wendy " with a " excited " personality .	-5.5886
" Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as well as possible , " says the site of True Companion .	-4.7901
So she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.6628
She also has her votes during the day - just like real people !	-3.6991
She can be tired of being fixed to conversation or she can be " in mood " !	-3.5018
There are many disturbing aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they are replacing real human relations - but the submissive female characteristics , the allusions to rape , when one step goes to Frigid ( meaning here : contradictory ) Farrah , worry one of the most .	-6.6118
On his website True Companion Roxxxxxx compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-3.3893
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have a roxxxxx ? " says it on the site .	-3.4750
However , these sex robots are not only a fetish or simply a different sex toys .	-3.3446
Their origins and increasing refinements point to something darkkers and lowers in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-5.5080
Most men , of course , will not keep sex robots , and while the FRR is recording its growing popularity , they remain on the brink of consumer culture .	-5.7393
But what is obsessed with the peripheral areas can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.4797
And many people are not strange or insulting until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.7410
There is a certain overlap that these sophisticated sex robots are appearing at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who has dared to have sexual assault on women .	-5.9734
The most discontinuing aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphic images , the splendidly body and the exhausted eyes , but how realistic this vision is .	-6.9450
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-2.9951
The objective behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( even with porn proportions ) .	-3.2027
Their builders want them to feel human , that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-3.9291
But , to the point when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots do not represent real women .	-2.9542
They cannot be separated from their pet or simply removed .	-3.4475
They have no mediation or background , nothing that suggests independence or anything that might disrupt imagination of total submission .	-9.9688
In other words , they are broken slaves .	-2.1493
Or use it in the 2017 speech : kingdoms	-5.2655
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.7075
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-1.3112
It has become the trump era ’ s trump that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split families in small format .	-4.7544
In the US , round about Christmas and Harvest , there were newspapers with advice on how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s favorite relatives .	-5.2519
All of us allegedly work to fill our filter bubbles .	-5.0432
Fewer noticed , Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-1.7413
I mention this because my cousine , a leftist poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family , visited me in New York this week .	-2.8852
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.7406
With Trump in the White House , anyone who knows them , including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and seldom on the same side .	-4.8535
This is certainly a good thing for the Essen table , but it strikes me in another context that it brings considerable risks .	-5.6742
The left was strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s disfiguring effect has the power to put us all right .	-4.0185
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we refer to the grim possibility that we will no longer be able to kick-off his shirts one day .	-6.5822
There is , however , an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump will “ normalize ” Republicans of the right wing , which suddenly seem to be an inconsistency when compared to his standards .	-6.2551
Today , I find myself in an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urban version of the mad cow - the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax statement was ) - both of which , in fact , seem to be a very mild offence compared to Trump .	-6.5418
When Trump goes , Republicans ’ next candidate must be healthy only to qualify for immeasurable improvement .	-4.3007
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park , the largest of New York ’ s carousel park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don ’ t need a coffee .	-5.1406
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are rigid and the animals turn out to be terribly afraid of their own shoulders - are extremely dark and the climatic music conveys this in a strange way .	-6.7602
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings become old , the skylines become familiar to provide much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.1494
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not entirely out of the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a major roundabout in North London .	-5.2987
However , the Central Park Karuschell is still a strange magical experience , as there are two two-year old , a 11-year-old one and two women in the 40s and all have a great time .	-6.7650
If I had been able to evaluate the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but , fortunately , no one asked them .	-4.9426
On the other hand , this week in a department of stores I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could get through my credit card .	-3.8133
In the coffee shop at the corner of my street , it is the same thing , plus the option of converting the assessment with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the commercial .	-11.2472
This not only leads to a slowdown in what should be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed .	-5.2152
The poor woman in the department was apologizing , while I was tired of the experience of allocating my credit card with five stars .	-4.8668
Oscar Pistorius , moved from prison to hospital with breast pain .	-3.5742
Pistorius left the hospital for the second time .	-2.2546
Last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his handlings , which he told the prison authorities after a case in his cell .	-6.2378
Pistorius was convicted of a first sentence on death because of murder after an appeal from the prosecutors .	-4.8587
He killed Steenkamp in the early stages of the Valentine 's Day in 2013 , raising it to her on several occasions through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria .	-6.6603
Pistorius claimed that he kept his girlfriend for a night night night intriguing in the cabin .	-5.6130
The prosecutors have announced their intention to do this time against the six-year sentence of Pistorius Appell , which they say is too lenient .	-4.8190
The National Criminal Traffic Authority said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year .	-4.5077
Pistorius runs the risk that his sentence will be increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful .	-4.1147
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7943

On Tuesday , schoolboy Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Dortmund Biesental in Eppenhofen . .	-8.2461
As a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and director Meder chose a young eagle , who grows up in the chickery , then is released into freedom .	-7.1790
In addition , the murderer scar produced a musical entitled " The Adler in the Hähnerhof " .	-6.2626
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to be buried by his chickens .	-10.5047
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .	-8.3990
But the hope of making him a chicken fell apart , the eagle spread out his wings and disappeared on a high mountain .	-6.3990
The classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the admission of Yvonne Frank .	-3.4899
The Hennen danced with the young gocks who wore cylinders to bet .	-5.4373

I would like to say a word of thanks to my fellow Members , former Head of Education , Michael Müller , who constantly jumps in trainings and parents ' representatives .	-7.3024
The kicking time has passed , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.1536
She leaves her students very reluctant after two years of teaching , because it was a really great time .	-4.3124

Two Bulgarian people arrested for illegal campsites in Greece	-10.1012
Two Bulgaria have been arrested for illegal campsites in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted on television .	-3.9344
On the morning of 1 August , a group of illegally camping people was arrested in Sithonia by the police , including the two Bulgarian people .	-4.5635
They were released on the same day , while an investigation is underway .	-2.9192
The foreign ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarian people were released later .	-3.1835
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camps and have given considerable financial penalties to anyone who is found in a place not intended for that purpose .	-4.9497
The checks will continue throughout the season .	-1.9819
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-1.9633
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the people concerned need to know now .	-3.0894
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-2.1777
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?	-2.5416
The most important questions and answers .	-2.3517
At the diesel summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars . are . are . . are with .	-11.5440
They should improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 and partly Euro 6 emission classes .	-4.7204
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-9.0946
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club Europe gives you some insights :	-4.0807
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.7288
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.1181
" The mandatory updates are only valid for vehicles that have shoe software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-4.0387
The KBA has ordered its retrofitting equipment .	-4.2066
How and when are customers informed about updates ?	-1.8202
Manufacturers have announced speedy implementation in the coming months , but have not given an exact date .	-4.2316
Daimler has announced that he will appoint each party .	-4.6285
If an inspection is due in any case , that will be done within its framework .	-3.9178
How long will the overall resourcements go ?	-3.6027
" To say sword , " means Smetanin .	-2.3448
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and on political pressure .	-2.8344
" For we have seen car manufacturers do not act voluntarily on the environment ' .	-4.1664
How long should the update last ?	-1.3407
The restructuring itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.3127
More time consuming can be getting an appointment .	-3.5643
What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.4170
The ACE plan to wait .	-2.3276
I suppose foreign manufacturers would be pulling up , that is Smetanin .	-5.5202
Is a massive fall in the price of Euro 4 cars looming ?	-3.8184
ACE is afraid of that .	-1.9237
But precisely in the regions where driving bans are at risk .	-3.7415
In rural areas , there have been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.3473
ACE plans to wait for a sale .	-2.9293
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Record .	-2.4739
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.3367
The first prize ceremony under President Trump promises to be political .	-2.6642
One of the winners does not want to come from protest .	-2.6302
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the best awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-3.8626
This year , as the cultural institution announced on Thursday , Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the authors .	-4.4178
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .	-1.7087
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will organise a reception and , together with his wife Melania , take part in the award .	-9.1071
Lear , the winner of the Progressive TV series , has thus already announced that he did not participate in the Gala .	-5.8303
He said ' The New York Times ' : ' This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights completely - even deprive them of the resources - and that strains me ' .	-5.8384
The 59-year-old Estefan said she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.3541
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.1008
The former prizewinners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-3.1064
We make the city Livable	-2.7122
Roland Wacker , Haslach Stadtbauder , will be retiring next year .	-3.7752
The place is already vacated , but suitable applicants are rare .	-4.2961
Wacker is a town builder for 31 years .	-3.1162
And the work still makes him very much fun as he conveys in the press debate .	-5.9038
He reports various but also challenging tasks waiting for his successor .	-3.5318
At the same time , he is astonished that no application has been completed .	-4.4482
The city is looking for an architecture or a building engineer next time .	-4.7825
In this way - under the regular notice periods - there is still enough time to prepare them .	-6.2268
As Haslach acts as the Lower Construction Authority , the Applicant must provide appropriate qualifications .	-5.2015
This function certainly wants to keep the city .	-2.0861
If they were no longer able to fill them , citizens would have to go for advice until after Offenburg .	-4.9092
But proximity to the citizen is important to the city and to him himself , says Wacker , reports of a good working climate and good mood between authority and citizens .	-5.6665
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , looking to the waker with pride .	-5.4680
" We make the town worth living , " he is sure of the Bauhaus and his staff . .	-10.2461
In future , however , there are varied projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla-Areas and the Niederhofen Park , for example , have been initiated .	-5.9978
The bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium is still a topic .	-3.8739
The latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million if we do ' s right .	-12.2500
" All in all great tasks await my successor .	-1.3416
The work here is fun . '	-1.4770
There is plenty of room for an urban builder .	-4.8133
Haslach ’ s own construction and gardening could be reacted to a lot of flexibility .	-4.3979
" People can move a lot " , so wacker , and the design of the green areas is often commended by citizens and visitors .	-5.6243
As the old town stands as an ensemble under the protection of monuments , it is important to have " an eye for what is clean " when new buildings are approved , stresses the outgoing city builder .	-5.9612
Ohin is responsible for the town builder .	-5.6819
He is a owner , " at the end everything is running over my table " .	-4.0583
At the same time , he can count on long-term employees : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been involved for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( underground ) for 15 years .	-6.6822
Also , that his successor remains long , Wacker wants : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the site " .	-5.4366
For continuity is important not only for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .	-3.4979
If you want to occupy Roland Wacker , after the information of the city of Haslach , you should be able to study a diploma or bachelor with a specialist in architecture and have good knowledge of construction and construction law .	-8.8051
The Municipal Office undertakes high- and lowered construction , construction plan , basic employment matters , management of urban properties , urban urban farm with construction and city gardens as well as sub-building authority including monuments protection .	-10.1414
Cycling through guided tours : closed southern railway station	-4.4656
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had taken the blue bike from the railway track management in the Leobener Strasse ( B116 ) to the lines .	-7.0843
They were so badly damaged that the transfer of goods had to be stopped .	-3.0195
The investigators go out of two male dancers and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-5.9776
Close to the crime there was a rotary roller and a bicycle driver observed by Zeugen .	-6.6695
" This goes far beyond a Lausbubensteich , " said ÖBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA .	-3.4341
The perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and would also put rail transport at risk .	-5.9560
In addition to damage to the location and the facility , as well as the delay of minutes and the cost of rail services , passenger cars for rail customers could also be provided to the perpetrators .	-7.8086
Overall , the speaker said that there was a ' substantial ' amount .	-3.8714
The damage was remedied again on Friday afternoon , and rail transport on the southern railway line could not be carried out without disabilities .	-7.1389
Nearly ten passenger trains were issued on Friday morning , two of them were long-distance transport .	-9.7441
Goods have not been used , but they have been delayed .	-4.0157
According to the ÖBB spokesman , Christoph Posch had to be replaced by more than 200 metres of lines .	-4.8594
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-0.9665
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help to relieve IBD ( inflammatory doom ) .	-3.7834
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.4088
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammable symptoms .	-3.7528
The unholy state , which affects around 1.3 million in the US , and 300 000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach and blows , recurring or bloody deaths , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-6.8051
While those affected are usually beaten meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found out that the essential amino trumps of proteins are contributing to the development of immune cells that promote a tolerant amount .	-6.8219
The lead researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in intestinal to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in food do not penetrate into the body .	-4.6356
Treatments that can trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-4.4290
If the equilibrium goes too far towards inflammation , it may result in inflammatory doom .	-5.2822
Experiments found that a type of tolerance stimulates immune cell occurs in mice that wear a certain bacteria in their infections .	-6.0034
And the bacteria requires Trytophan - one of the building blocks of protein - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.2923
Professor Colonna said : " We have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of Darm microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-4.9492
The more Trytophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-9.0114
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and one of Trytophan ’ s rich diet promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory hemisphere , if the same system also applies to humans .	-6.1133
The Postdoctorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a type of immune cell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study girls had such cells , but another group of the same stem , which was divided , did not .	-5.1380
She believed that the difference with the intmmic macros of the mice had to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi normally live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-5.8792
The demons of the mice were sequence DNA and there were six types of bacteria present in the mice with immune cells , but without them missing in the mice .	-5.3772
Mhous were pulled up in a sterile environment , so that they did not have a microbiom and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they were given to the L. reuteri and immune cells .	-7.8671
In order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , researchers L. reuteri increased in a liquid and then translated small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - on unmature immune cells isolated from the mice .	-5.8220
The immune cells developed into tolerant cells .	-3.3434
When the active component was cleaned from fluid , it proved to be a by-product of the Trytophan-Metabolism known as intol 3 lactic acid .	-3.8452
When researchers doubled the amount of Tryptophane in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the Trytophans were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-5.2357
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri in our gastrointestine tracts protect .	-4.5751
It is not known whether Trytophan-by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to Trytophan were found in humans with inflammable intangibility .	-5.5678
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.7608
Potentially high levels of droptopane in the present of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . "	-5.0162
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United committed a Genie with Nemanja Matic .	-2.1425
At Manchester United signed a " genie " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria .	-4.2177
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last prediction game before the UEFA Super-Cup against Real Madrid begins Tuesday , impressing in the halter role when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira moved to Beleben .	-5.4070
Matic , however , was excluded from the preparedness Asia-Tournee of the Blues and managed only 45 minutes , which allowed Mourinho to improve before the start of the Premier League-season .	-5.3754
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-7.8629
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.3759
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romeliu Lukaku began in the Aviva stadium when Mourinho wrote his start XI for the season .	-6.0848
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority commitments .	-5.0305
" I thank the club for getting three of four , " he added .	-3.2035
" I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made a lot of effort . "	-3.9318
Boeing " malt " Dreamliner in the Sky	-2.5122
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-3.2260
The pilot flowed from Seattle to the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the US state of Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which are several thousand kilometres .	-5.3319
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-2.0579
On the radar umbrellas was the form of a Dreamliner .	-4.3862
The whole thing was an extension test for new engines .	-4.0316
Boeing had made such advertising earlier .	-2.8515

New Lost for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a Problem	-3.1556
The wind is turning : when Sigmar Gabriel was SPD chief , social-democratic prime ministers always looked after Berlin with some concern before elections .	-5.2393
Not a fan of the party ’ s central party , just a headwinds out of the covenant – that is the main desire of the electoral fighters .	-9.4943
Since Martin Schulz led the party , that has changed fundamentally .	-2.1971
Since then , the employees of the Willy Brandt house have been watching the events in the Capital of the SPD with growing horror .	-5.8465
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in the approach with headwinds .	-3.9771

After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against SPD and Green coalitions .	-4.2852
" This once again shows that red green can simply not govern reliably , " CDU Secretary Peter Tauber said to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-4.3203
The surprise takeover of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a serious crisis .	-4.9086
Five months before the land election , his red-green coalition lost its one-stop majority in the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.3131
The founder , Michael Kelner , has called on the abrupt founder of Lower Saxony Elke Twestern to return their mandate .	-6.3251
The takeover of the CDU is a clear distortion of the will of the electorate .	-3.7084
Elke Twestern must return their mandate immediately , " said the leader of the Federal Government and the campaign of the Greens to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-6.8855
" All this must not be true , " a SPD electoral fighter sighes when the new hiobbottom-up reached the party centre on Friday morning .	-8.6998
Stephan Weil , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without its own governing majority after the takeover of the Green MEP Elke Twest .	-6.8236
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in the Social Democrats .	-4.2192
And no one knows what comes next .	-1.6284
The Misere began with the unexpected defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-3.0635
A blue eye , no more , the comrades calmed .	-3.6572
After the country election in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.9717
That has also been done - and it has been all significantly worse .	-5.3416
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the baptismal , the Dusdorf-Pleite seized the party glamously .	-5.9350
The comrades grabbed cheaply in the weeks afterwards .	-4.6981
Then , when they had just exhausted new courage , the G-20 summit of Hamburg came .	-2.7510
And with him came the next downward .	-2.4166
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD head , lost his Nimbus this weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmonic while his town was burned .	-5.0134
And because after that , in crisis communication , he did so much wrong , which can be done wrong .	-5.2967
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.6201
Now it is also Stephan Weil .	-3.9203
The Dutch Prime Minister has long been criticised for some time now because of the VW exhaustion and his role in the Supervisory Board .	-5.6888
Mixed poll values were added .	-2.4072
Yet , or perhaps this is precisely why , over the past few weeks , it has been increasingly trying to set accents in the covenant .	-6.4243
The aim of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not to conceal comrades around Martin Schulz .	-5.5914
They allowed him to grant it because they promised to stabilise the party .	-3.8717
The opposite may now be true .	-2.0165
It is because the party internal divisions of the Lower Saxony Green are basically not guilty .	-5.5437
And Schulz not at all .	-3.1417
At the moment , the comrades try to keep their own ranks closed .	-4.3584
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and here I am referring in particular to the outright parliamentarians of Twest .	-6.9638
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twen puts her own career interests over the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of party leaders in the SPD parliamentary group , the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.7359
Mrs Twestern has been elected to Parliament not for her person as a direct candidate , but on the list of the Greens from Lower Saxony , as the Dutch MEP continues .	-6.0742
The logical consequence would be that they return their mandate .	-2.3636
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestag , deplores a " undemocratic maneuver " .	-10.4645
" The will of the electorate four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil a prime minister , " says Oppermann , who is leading the Lower Saxon SPD as a prime candidate to the parliamentary election , the RND .	-5.5360
" Now the personal career figures of a future CDU member are distorting the result of the election , " Oppermann continued to say . .	-10.8937
He asked to clarify the background .	-1.7739
I want to know whether more has been there or more commitments have been made by the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-3.8729
Money for Cities III	-3.7745
Those who want to reinstate their house in the years can soon receive support from the country .	-4.4271
Presentated mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Stadtwerke on Wednesday in Feigngen .	-5.0370
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler returned to the event .	-4.4325
Since 1991 there have been rehabilitation areas in reception areas .	-3.9914
At that time , in the Sanctions Area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden-Württemberg still took over two-thirds of the grant amount .	-4.8926
After all , in the 2005 sanctioning area , the grant was 60 % .	-5.0568
For Schindler , the sanctuaries are a " success project " - it is important to promote inner development as well , and not just to open up new construction areas .	-6.2962
On 4 April , the Bureau of the Government of Karlsruhe received the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-4.9672
The grant amount amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country , the rest of the community .	-5.0130
What is the result of a rehabilitation area ?	-3.1628
They will , as Schindler continued , investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-5.2291
However , it is also important to confirm whether there is any interest in the planned .	-4.5153
If necessary , the territorial borders could then be changed once again .	-4.0132
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Piezshmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-3.3098
Keller presented the contents of the " Social City " programme , which would allow the sanctuaries to be carried out .	-5.0184
At the heart of the programme are the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the preservation and expansion of the infrastructure .	-5.6399
The measures would be taken object-based , i.e. per piece of land .	-2.6950
The area of rehabilitation would then be defined as statutes .	-3.9004
The eligibility period for the funding runs from 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-3.0568
However , until September this year we would first carry out the inventory , in which the persons involved in the rehabilitation area will have a questionnaire for completion .	-7.5758
In November or December , the decision on the Statute is to be made as possible so that the sanctions can start next year .	-7.1401
After that , Pietzschmann explained that every community must carry out the aforesaid investigation .	-5.4906
It is a question of evaluating urban depressions and deciding when to reverse and to what extent .	-5.6914
It will then also be entered in the property book for the respective plot .	-6.8136
Pietzschmann will come back after the reception and make an image of the situation , promised her .	-6.3364
Gotzel emphasized that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .	-3.5078
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.7104
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and ground floor " , which includes the architectural condition and the restoration findings .	-6.2923
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing arch " , information on the size , distribution and inhabitants of a living room can be made .	-4.6610
The blue " operating arch " is only to be filled if business rooms are operated in the building .	-4.6491
However , Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a application for funding .	-3.8183
Moreover , new construction measures are not conducive .	-3.5921
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds according to the " Windhound principle " works - who comes first is mahling first .	-7.6571
You cannot reserve any funding for later on .	-3.7403
In conclusion , photos of the project " Municipal II " were still shown to make the attendees a rehabilitation " tasty " .	-6.6322
British inventors use themselves a microchip to get to home and car with a hand movement .	-4.5590
A British inventor is the first to be equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand movement .	-4.6570
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between Daumen and Zeitinger and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to facilitate their life with technology from his company BioTeq .	-5.4120
He has collaborated with Dr. Geoff Watson , an adviser on anaesthetics in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is performed according to medical standards .	-4.9662
The technology resembles cats and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.0564
Mr Northam 's company would also like to change the locks on houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per chateau .	-4.5725
The married father of one has now built up both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is on the wheel .	-4.9253
The White House ’ s advertising costs the taxpayer Thousands	-2.2541
The White House ’ s decision to fly a Marine helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s data left to the TIME magazine .	-4.2349
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.3138
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and senior White House officials have made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-3.1242
The helicopter , built in Connecticut , was exhibited next to a yacht from Maine , a Wisconsin firefighter and a forklift from Mississippi .	-8.6584
The White House ’ s military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , following the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-4.0966
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility " , the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event his superiors , the deputy naval officer for aviation .	-4.7186
The news showed that the helicopter met at 5 p.m. on 17 July at the South Lawn for the event , and so long before the race was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-6.3920
The note adds that , if the departure from the White House should be delayed , a second team for the return flight would be required due to the limitation of hours .	-4.7564
The original flight crew was present at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the ground during the time .	-4.5491
The records provided by TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was required .	-4.2824
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state-owned property for political purposes .	-2.8994
Data sets indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could infringe the provision .	-2.9003
" One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case " , the commander wrote .	-3.2369
" Sounds as if you are closed , " the vice-commander replied .	-3.9897
The event " Made in America " was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.5705
But official events also have political overtones .	-1.7867
At the event , the President gave impetus to the reform of health reform , which was under way in the Senate , and he advocated efforts to curb government rules .	-5.7587
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes .	-2.4048
Presidents are obliged to use them for their journey .	-2.3293
But asking for their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-4.1419
Trump conducted an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft operated in Melbourne , Florida , and Taxis , against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news about the use of the presidential aircraft by .	-5.2606
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made in America " - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials " , said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walter .	-4.1457
HMX-1 occupations often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to replace US presidents in the White House with precise censimetres .	-4.3996
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit at the beginning of July , HMX-1 held 58 training landings in the White House .	-3.5994
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of flight crew for the month , a civil servant said .	-3.9930
Helicopter units added 11 hours this day for non-presidential support missions .	-2.3785
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden of none of the other assets presented at the event .	-3.4202
A speaker from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in imagining the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.7030
HMX-1 does not support the presidential flights for any budget , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-4.3886
According to the annual rates of the US Defense Department for the 2017 financial year , however , the VH 3D reimbursement rate is $ 24.380 per hour .	-4.3134
The flight time of the aircraft is 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.8875
The White House argues that the actual cost of the operation of the helicopter is far below that rate .	-10.0093
" Setting the cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for reimbursement is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.4207
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs that are included in the annual funds ' .	-2.8919
According to a RAND study in 2015 , refunds for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and conclusion of the contract .	-11.4312
At this time , the White House ’ s former press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the deployment of the helicopter for the event .	-3.1166
" The idea is to present things this week that are manufactured in America , " said Spicer .	-2.5729
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .	-3.6867
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.0134
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-1.9540
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he took his tour of South Lawn for the event , but he set himself in the headquarter of a firefighter .	-4.8225
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and wrestled with the media about his own corporate fleet .	-4.1696
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.3798

Despite the fact that five parties still have a flawless record , the leader of the Second Tennis League has received the sense of reality .	-7.2323
Team leader Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-2.7587
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar form .	-2.8399
It is on the back of the positions that I find the team very good . '	-3.4747
The main factors for class and stability in the field of addictor SV are imports from the High North .	-5.5091
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to bets in the Davis Cup .	-2.4265
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay with a view to Harri Heliavara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Essen Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-3.7720
" As always , this is hard for us .	-5.8257

How America Can Dam OMV	-2.4141
Donald Trump did not work effectively when he placed his signature on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-4.6070
" In his haste to enact the law , " Congress appealed for a few " unconstitutional regulations " , he said .	-5.5955
The response from Moscow was as strong as expected , and even Brussels ashamed of the US push .	-3.6163
After all , the draft penalises European companies that help the Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.8402
Since then , investors of domestic OMV have been concerned and are co-financing the construction of Nord Stream 2 , together with other European companies .	-6.2075
The drought is huge .	-2.6095
However , it is too early to assess the consequences , the official statement of the oil group .	-4.0876
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to revive the sanctions by means of an executive order .	-4.0325

Narcot ’ s Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be placed in the heatline of Netflix .	-4.9151
Despite the second season of Narcos , which Pablo Escoars Killer revealed , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-4.8761
The stacks three and four were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest Bösewight of the show .	-5.3606
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the richest organisation of drug trafficking in the world : the Cali cartel .	-4.0621
Led by four powerful patrons , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more state bribes and violent action .	-4.7767
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartels , Miguel Rodriguez Orejuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) ordered the Mexican link , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-3.9442

On September 1 , the city of Krefeld once again takes over the catering services in the city ’ s Children ’ s Day Centre ( Kitas ) .	-7.1746
This is good news for Sonja Pomeranz , deputy leader in the field of youth aid , " we have all been very pleased " .	-5.5519
A caterer will take this task out of his home and will prepare fresh bread .	-6.8879
The city operates in the Krefeld area of 46 children 's days , in 44 children receive a warm meal for lunch time .	-5.5333
In the last Kita year , 2800 children were on the tables each year , and the demand is growing steadily .	-5.8705
" Meanwhile , not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week in the Kita at lunch , " explains Pomeranz .	-5.2634
" The offer also applies in the 35-hour support if children stay until 14 p.m. " .	-4.1623
46 Part-time workers have a kitchen service from 1 September : they receive the products , supplement them with salads , pipes and fruit , portray the meals individually , place the food , relax and clean the kitchen .	-9.3663
" The employees are " assigned to a Kita " , says Pomeranz .	-4.0093
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group facilities - determines the amount of time spent .	-5.1213
" The kitchen heroes are now firmly part of the Kita team " , says Pomeranz satisfied .	-4.3455
" That is how they are much more integrated and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for Kitalite . "	-5.3996
It is also a question of healthy eating and cooking classes .	-3.7868
" Children are meant to help prepare the meal " .	-2.3766
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .	-2.4358
Also for children .	-1.8305
" They have a known force in the Kita , a person who is familiar to them and not always changing people " .	-3.9141
This continuity is important for children .	-1.0893
The purification of the Kita rooms - so far the task of the kitchen staff - will be dealt with by special cleaning staff in the future .	-5.0173
In addition to improving the quality of kitchen performance , this variant - the separation of cleaning and cooking services - also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economical in terms of the cost ratio between self-governing and leveraging for the city .	-7.4966
And that , even though 46 relaunches .	-3.4514
" But these hours are not so strong in the field of education at around 750 people , " says Sonja Pomeranz .	-5.0437

Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women are fully involved and involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.9178
Afghan elections to the provincial Council and the presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.3344
The Taliban have published threats to an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international combatants to a consultative role .	-3.5925

Killing Out of Thirty Years	-6.0360
Two young men aged 19 and 23 years should have tried on Thursday to take up a 13-year-old girl .	-4.1238
According to police information , the men used the 13-year-old men who had their friends on the Kolping Road to speak at 2.55 p.m. because they wanted to speak with the girl 's mobile phone .	-7.7804
The 13 year-old man refused to leave the request and went on with her friends .	-4.9424
As a result , one of the perpetrators tried to pick up the mobile and the necklace of the girl , which however failed .	-5.8181

Market concern about investments at the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-3.0002
A trade union wants to assure McVitie at the managers of the Bikuit manufacturer about the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .	-11.9896
GMB Scotland said that the company was talking about the future of investment in Tollcross 's territory .	-5.4758
More than 500 employees work in the plant which , besides other products , produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse .	-4.5075
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-3.1224
He added that workers and trade union representatives would ' experience first ' if their activities were to change .	-3.2313
In a letter to the company ’ s subsidiary , GMB Scotland McVitie called on ' to express concern that funding for modernising production lines is not being promoted ' .	-6.2133
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross affects our members profoundly .	-5.1235
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce focus strongly on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantages .	-5.2076
Therefore , in the context of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the backdrop of Brexit , rising cost of living , and chronic fall in production , the eastern end of Glasgow desperately needs a thriving production presence at McVitie .	-4.9216
A speaker from Pladis said : " The subsidiary at Tolcross only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to this , as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-6.3935
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-3.9783
We discussed with the staff that , like all companies involved in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-5.5348
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross countries , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-4.5446
We fully recognise the heritage of Tolcross as a place of production , and if our operations at the site are to change , staff and trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-6.6382
Has the PSG Barcelona warned Neymar three years ago ?	-1.6058
The side of La League may regret its interest in Marco Verratti .	-3.6930
Paris Saint-Germain will not stop in its persecution of Neymar , having made an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger its release clause , but did she warned Barcelona three years ago before the world record fall ?	-6.9808
The sensational approach has fueled the summer transfer window , because the League 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than double the previous mark , with Paul Pogba returning for <unk> 89 million to Manchester United last season .	-5.1229
After finishing , Neymar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paid professional athlete .	-4.0235
Barcelona is angry about how Neymar has forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan executive is that the club has always done its best to take care of him since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-5.6772
But was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?	-2.3600
When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi , Nasser Al Khuaifi had a strict warning for every club that wanted to sign one of the best PSG players .	-4.2930
" I 'm not concerned because they know that when they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.7086
" We respect all clubs .	-0.8543
But if they try to sign one of our players , this will have consequences . "	-3.0579
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish Association expressing interest in the PSG Mittelfeldspieler Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-4.5203
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offerings for Neymar .	-4.0730

Interview : ' DomSpaniards report discharge Pope brother Georg Ratzinger '	-4.4735
The Regensburger DomSpaniards report on abuses relieves Pope 's brother Georg Razinger .	-5.4600
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.9570
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Cathedral further raises discussion .	-4.2752
Christian Wesnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , declared after publication to the German Press Agency , he obtained an apology from the former Regensburger Bishop and present-day Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the infamous Pope Benedict XVI .	-6.3837
It would be a great tool for the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions , or their misinterpretation of what happened at the time .	-6.1064
The Vatican " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised the fact that " double standards " were used when reporting violence in the domes .	-6.0931
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that it is ' shameful and humiliating action ' which should be punished and prevented in the future ; it is obvious that the ' degree of media manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Bioethics Committee , is the ' degree of media manipulation ' .	-7.6991
" The habit of designating the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal , " says Scaraffia .	-4.7535
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk : " You 'll be happy to go to the church and this is a festive meal " .	-6.8606
She also pointed out that in her youth , " shots were a very normal pedagogical means " to deal with young children , as I was one , " .	-5.5008
It would seem unfair to apply the current standards to earlier decades , because the world has changed .	-4.1081
When it comes to reports of abuse , Pope brother Georg Ratzinger also appeared .	-5.1239
The author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the memorial band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated in 12 languages ) .	-5.2390
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger " , says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-3.7594
What exactly is the 440-page report that the Enlightenment Attorney Ulrich Weber , commissioned by Bishop Regensburg , has presented ?	-4.1382
A total of 547 Regensburger 's domes were used sexually between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 doms .	-6.3567
The final report states that it was Georg Ratzinger who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " To sum up , Domkapellmeister R. in many cases used forms of physical and mental violence .	-5.7431
Especially at high emotionality , the punishment for the students could be more severe .	-5.3660
Nevertheless , contrary to many other accusations , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. , so in many cases , despite violence , they even associate positive memories with him " .	-6.9651
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburger Domspawn of Georg Ratzinger is discharge .	-6.3609
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence on protective beams at the Regensburger Cathedral sites ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-6.8776
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-2.7420
On the other hand , he also appears as a cholerian and perfectionist , who was often physically handsome when a domspach did not produce top performance .	-8.3848
How do you view this final report as your biograph ?	-2.6243
Michael Hesemann : If you are bothering you and read the entire 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask themselves why the name Georg Ratzinger comes in .	-6.7879
They are just eight pages dedicated to him and they are clearly released from every suspicion of meditation or coexistence in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-6.9182
The violence texts at first school also took place outside its sphere of performance .	-5.1721
He can be accused of being too late or of having not taken seriously enough first memories .	-4.8094
The dome mymnasium on which he worked was perceived by practically all the respondents as " salvation " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-5.6965
The vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , also exhibit an excellent testimony , describes him as a " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understandable " , as a highly lucrative teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , necks and bons , and " was always relocated from grapes of children " .	-8.9277
Only a minority complain about perfectionism and its high emotionality , which also led to waves .	-5.1538
He committed himself many years ago , deeply deplored and apologized for the fact that he had not only stuck with his stomach and threw the keys on the ground , but also distributed earlobes and sent out too fresh boys to the hair or ears .	-10.8378
However , to his homicide , it must be said that such education methods were widely used in the time in question , in the 1960s and 1970 ’ s , among parents and teachers . . . the , , , , , , , ,	-11.1938
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-7.3296
Of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.3087
I have also seen this in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-3.1016
Compared with what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the acts of violence at first school , that is , of course , minor issues .	-6.5691
One wonders whether it was not more to do with his fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media just fell on him .	-6.7024
Many of those who have never understood him are still working diligently on the Bavarian .	-3.7427
The truth is , however , that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect ! .	-3.6672
A great deal has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse in the Regensburger domains .	-5.4326
Will Georg Ratzinger , in the final report , also be charged with any involvement or solidarity in sexual abuse ?	-4.8807
Michael Hesemann : absolutely no .	-2.1226
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted themselves to the dome master .	-3.6778
Not even parents were soiled .	-2.2785
" I never managed to talk to my father or mother about it , " said a person who was deputy for the others , " I was all very embarrassing " .	-6.7810
The real problem with the detection of sexual abuse was and is that most victims were silent from shame .	-4.6135
If they were not even familiar with parents and siblings , then certainly not a choir leader who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators on a professional basis .	-6.3924
How do we assess the role played by the Dutschutz Abbey Ratzinger in terms of abuses ?	-8.0457
Michael Hesemann : A friend of mine put it so : " With regard to sexual abuse ... I see no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had had had timely knowledge and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-6.7869
I consider it ... also to be really absurd to think that it is better to equip him ... Jacks have opened up more forcefully or more clearly , than to their parents , internships , trust teachers , etc .	-9.9481
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-3.0902
The report thus gives a very clear result : ' It could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' that pupils and / or their surroundings were entrusted to it in the run-up to the time .	-7.9130
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free to talk of any coexistence .	-4.5591
Nor can he be accused of not prevented or advertised .	-4.2737
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these unfortunate crimes , as happened unfortunately in some cases .	-3.8466
In the media , there was much to read about " violence processes " in the Regensburger 's domains .	-5.2823
Georg Ratzinger , former domicile master , is accused of " Weggen " in the report .	-5.9288
Does he have to live up to this accusation ?	-2.1029
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem , of course , that the coverage mixes everything and has been mended into a huge message of sexual abuse and violence and acts of violence and somewhere , in the middle of the central , Georg Ratzinger .	-7.8450
This , however , is precisely what this report is all about .	-4.4153
The fact is that neatly separate : between pre-school and gymnasium of the domes , between sexual abuse and the use of violence , and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.4452
In addition , the report deals with incidents dating back to 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not head of the Cathedral .	-5.4488
The whole horrific pedagogy , the cases in which so many sadist teachers were regularly harassed and maligned and also horrified , all occurred at the pre-school in Eterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions need to be prevailed .	-9.8746
But with them , Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do , for he got the boys first to face when they were already on the dome gymnasium .	-5.6458
On the one hand , as most of the witnesses stress , the topic " pre-school " was taboo .	-5.1934
You were only happy to escape and enjoyed the so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-3.9840
What was different on the dome mymnasium ?	-3.5803
Michael Hesemann : Although there was discipline , there was no sadistic violence .	-4.1021
That also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims appreciated the general humanity of R. and , therefore , in many cases , even positive memories of violence ' .	-6.4616
At the most , it remains the charge of having looked away .	-5.2211
Despite all the efforts , however , the report could define only two periods of time in which it was reported by pre-school conditions .	-5.2842
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and from the processes at a school where he was not acting and responsible , ( so the witnesses ) did not want to hear anything , and then again at 1993 .	-15.0594
Did Georg Ratzinger , in front of the states , consistently close the ears ?	-5.9149
Michael Hesemann : No , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domestic gymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-4.1582
In this regard , he points out that " the caning continues to be practiced in the pre-school " .	-6.3028
He recommended urgent intervention even given the risk of negative press releases .	-3.5229
This was , of course , a time when legal clarity existed , when prison sentences were long prohibited in Bavaria as well .	-5.1600
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone of us knows .	-3.7481
It was hard to see where the people affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatic and where the permissible limit was actually exceeded .	-6.1550
Nor can it be said that he has always looked away .	-4.0474
That is simply not true .	-1.2520
It was only in 1980 that the caning of schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-9.7726
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis said that it was unfair to apply the current pedagogical standards to the time .	-4.5214
How do you see it ?	-6.0390
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " trapple of anachronism " , that is , the danger of judging the past by moral standards today .	-4.9140
There the princes are right .	-3.3465
Of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was appalling at all times , nor to what happened in the primary school in terms of resistance and violence to innocent children ’ s souls , which goes far beyond that of ordinary people .	-8.4328
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being prepared .	-5.1520
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.2396
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say , of earsong and of hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970 ’ s .	-6.0305
When he was banned from physical punishment , he also kept strictly attached to it .	-4.8838
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger given in the talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-3.8270
Can the caning of cannons also be mentioned ?	-5.0571
Michael Hesemann : Well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , because the doms played only a minor role .	-4.9262
Nevertheless , I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.1799
But this too must be said : without this perfectionism , without the calls for unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world-class , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.5938
With trucks and bons alone , you won ’ t be able to win big singers and every success , whatever area , but always discipline , passion , and self-winding .	-8.4058
What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-3.7559
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced him as wonderful , humorous , gracious , deeply shiny , and good-hearted people , from which one cannot imagine that he could do just one flug .	-9.9689
I regularly get to know how many former domestics still today , 23 years after his exertation , keep in touch with him regularly - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of their family .	-5.2765
So those who have not yet forgiven him that he was strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-4.0836
Most of the domes are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .	-4.0705
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but was also a friendly respect to which they still host today and which they even worship .	-9.0670
I would ask you once again to make it quite clear that all the methods of education which were at the time on the agenda are education .	-6.6702
We can be glad that we have long since passed this time .	-2.2426
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to become a media scapegoat .	-3.5636
It is all too obvious that the evil intention behind it is .	-3.0147
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.1097
Now , the area , a 93-year-old man , who has acquired great merits , and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , no one would know the Dursburger Cathedral , would finally be in peace .	-8.9825
