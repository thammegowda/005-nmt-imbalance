Good : More safety for pedestrians	-1.0951
There are no 100 meters from each other : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian street at the DorfParkplatz was opened in Gugel . the are . are . , are . , are , , and are .	-13.9202
Two plants so close to each other : intention or shield ?	-3.1367
This question gave Guachs Mayor a clear answer yesterday .	-3.8429
" The Rathausampel was installed at that time because it secures the school path " , explained the ecker yesterday .	-5.0645
The Kluser-Ampell secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .	-4.8150
The plant which was officially launched yesterday is important for the junction area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-4.3228
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.2408
" The high traffic and pedestrians had to make their safety another traffic light , " said Eckert .	-5.5777
Peter Arnold also confirms this with the Landratbald Offenburg .	-4.3928
" According to current measurements , at the B 33 daily , about 12 000 vehicles pass the town of Guchat , of which 10 % of heavy goods traffic " , Arnold stresses .	-6.7705
Therefore , building another traffic light is more than necessary : ' Safety is just going on here ' , says Arnold .	-4.5147
Four traffic visits were carried out , including a roundabout , but were again discarded due to the severity of the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-7.5240
According to Arnold , everything was tested before the location of the traffic lights : " By means of an extra-long wooden trunk with our own vehicles we have chosen whether these vehicles can drive from the Sulzbahweg to the B 33 without knocking over the traffic lights " .	-11.3394
The " most modern of what is currently available on the market " , announced by Arnold , is the approximately EUR 15 000 expensive ample plant itself .	-7.4997
The complex is equipped with colour LEDs , which are so bright that the lights are well visible from the drivers , for example , in the deep sun .	-5.9625
And economical it is : the older light systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-3.8528
There are three light systems for every flight .	-4.6960
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.1089
When the pedestrians hit the traffic light button , the top radar sensor tests the traffic position .	-4.2204
If the road is free , the direct green for the pedestrians , if not , takes about 15 seconds .	-3.4903
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrians can be closed .	-4.1273
" If a group or disabled people go out of the road , the founding phase will be extended , so everyone will surely come across the road , " said Arnold .	-6.4046
Of course , the driver must think as a partner here and watch the journey .	-4.3893
This was not the case yesterday . The traffic light for pedestrians was green , the upper class vehicle rushed through - with shining red .	-6.3123
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the beauty of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-2.3887
The catastrophes of his catholic villagery - the language impotence , the sluggish to brute violence and mutilating sexuality , the anges and joy - have often described the Carinthian poet .	-8.9924
The book winner is known above all as a prosator , theater texts are in his works rar .	-6.3430
Collage from Provençal Gerhard Fresacer is responsible for his performance " Wetterlöchten im Spiegel " , which is now visible in Garage X at St. Petersplatches .	-10.9376
The theatre maker connects elements of the autobiographical novel " Der Leibegengengenen " ( 1987 ) with perceptions from " Leichnaum , his family loading " ( 2003 ) .	-5.7554
On the largely empty stage - important reproducibility : a deceased sofa , which is copied and masked on the illumination mode - the eight-person ensemble comes through the text material .	-10.7968
In doing so , director Freacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-4.1579
The 70-minute performance extends the submission with a wealth of tablets , known from the repertoire of postdramatic games .	-6.1498
In particular , the actors come to the sometimes dubious scent changes .	-11.3134
They are hardened with their head cast under water , baked to the wall with their sweets .	-7.2331
Immersed in Zellophan or Mieders , they stuck on dangerously high bushes through the staging , either monologizing them loudly or are completely silenced on the stage floor .	-8.6634
However , the text does not commit itself in this difficult way .	-5.0404
The best moments are in the evening , when the bandwidth reaches from Deep Purple to popular songs .	-5.2355
In the end , the overturning performance comes somewhat to tranquility , and Winklers , in the midst of an absurd humour .	-8.5272
A Blackbox in the car ?	-1.1637
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the accidental high speed system , and believe the solution to have found in a small black box that can fit in every car ’ s pocket .	-7.0113
The devices that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the federal planning offices to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads .	-4.7879
The typically boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-10.7955
Liberties have kindled with environmental groups , arguing that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres – and , perhaps , where they were drowned – and then use the information to calculate tax allowances .	-15.3216
The Tea Party is dispatched .	-2.7004
The United States Civil Liberties Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-3.6453
But , while Congress cannot agree to act , several states no longer wait .	-3.6972
They are currently examining how they can switch to a system for the next ten years , where drivers pay for a mile that .	-6.5690
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-1.9485
That really is a must for our country .	-1.7290
“ It ’ s nothing we can only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , CEO of the Southern California Assn. of Government , which plans to record the landed miles on all California drivers in the state from 2025 .	-5.8404
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.5073
The technology for this is there .	-1.3848
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , funded by taxes paid to US Americans at the camp camp , is failing .	-4.4043
But America no longer holds as much as it used to .	-3.7267
Cars use less petrol .	-1.6301
The national oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone ( less than 4 Eurocent per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.4118
Politicians do not dare at high prices to raise the tax just to raise one cent .	-3.8604
“ The petrol tax is simply not viable for the future , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-2.8946
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a flat-based payment system .	-3.3648
“ This is the most viable long-term alternative , ” he said .	-2.1718
bureaucrats call it a combined-based user fee .	-3.3888
It is not surprising that the idea is hacked in urban liberals , because the tax could , for example , be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climatic emissions are reduced .	-5.8815
The Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious state targets for climate change , which are laid down by law .	-5.8299
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also said that he sees the most recent long-term alternative .	-4.4192
The free marketing of the Reason Foundation is also an idea of allowing drivers to pay in return .	-6.2275
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” Adrian Moore explains Vice President for Reason guidelines .	-3.2765
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.2594
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers who , in a report in 2011 , asked Congress to move toward flat-based accounts .	-4.1340
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project covering 10,000 cars .	-2.5653
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the advance and responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who often have to spend many miles on the road to work or town in everyday life .	-6.2598
Nevertheless , several states and cities are heading for their own fist in this direction .	-4.6863
Oregon , which currently employs 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s biggest experiment , is the most dedicated .	-4.1443
These drivers will soon pay the Mileage charges instead of the Mineral Oil Tax to the state .	-4.1717
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.0343
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-2.3669
Illinois tests it with trucks to a limited extent .	-2.9116
And the I-95 coalition , which includes 17 states ’ transport ministries on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-3.8678
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.0389
In Nevada , where recently 50 volunteers were equipped with the devices , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-4.3194
“ Concerns against Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Management of Results in the Transport Ministry of Nevada .	-4.6187
People did not want it .	-1.2846
When the test started , the ACLU warned from Nevada on their website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into sophisticated surveillance devices . ”	-4.3058
There is no need to build a gigantic , unwieldy technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to capture data on the daily movements of individuals .	-3.8404
Nevada is part of a series of states that now look for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the drowned kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-5.2074
So , Khan , the public would be more reassured .	-2.9887
Some authorities have led to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-3.2695
The company did not originally act to help states tax drivers .	-4.0102
Rather , it was their goal to enter an emerging market for car insurance to pay drivers on the basis of the carry-carrying miles .	-6.6691
However , the devices tested by them are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and supply limited information regularly via modem .	-4.0180
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” Ryan Morrison , True Mileage ’ s Managing Director .	-4.5154
Some of these public pilot programmes made great mistakes .	-2.8204
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-2.5836
In Oregon , planners experiment with giving drivers a number of choices .	-3.1976
You can choose a device with or without a GPS .	-1.4049
Or they don 't choose a device at all and instead pay a package fee based on the miles safely driven by all the residents of the state .	-5.7450
Other sites hope to be able to sell the concept of a distrustful public by equipping the devices with more functions than using them .	-4.7462
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a system for taxation that also pays parking fees , insurance must be paid only for kilometres that are driven and speed data collected by other vehicles in real time , enabling drivers to avoid congestion .	-8.3424
“ Drikers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate , ” said in a city planning document .	-3.7575
However , some road planners ask themselves whether the whole talk about pay per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-5.6130
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for San Francisco Bay officials declared that Congress could resolve the problem of bankruptcy Highway Trust Fund simply by increasing fuel taxes .	-3.8135
An additional unique charge or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-5.2949
“ There is no reason for an operation if a Aspirin is also sufficient , ” explains Randy Renzscher , the head of Commission legislation and public affairs .	-5.1050
If we do , hundreds of millions of car drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .	-2.5411
Königsfeld : Small team beats a watchdog .	-4.5751
Voluntary fire fighters managed their autumn auction samples despite personnel shortages with bravour .	-5.7342
Only 11 men took part in the exercise .	-1.7833
Abparts commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the estate Federal in the Burgberger Straße in his practice .	-6.7898
A short circuit should be created there .	-3.9653
Two people were injured as a result of the fire and the smoke processing , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-5.5427
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two weapons shelters were prepared to enter the building .	-5.2817
After a short time , the first person was able to find and lead to free .	-4.5622
The second person had to be worn .	-1.2294
This was not as easy as a narrow staircase too was to be overcome .	-4.4066
The building , a workshop with an integrated pilotage for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-9.0117
There was a lot of wood and also of Strahlballen in it .	-3.8979
There were also electric machines for wood processing .	-3.1011
The first error was on the tank in the vehicle .	-2.4967
A further direction was over a floor-hydrate at about 100 meters from the hotel .	-7.8258
Now there were three possible deletion procedures .	-4.0189
A hollow tube was also used in the building .	-2.4993
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what to do with a few staff available .	-5.4137
In the worst case , assistance is provided through the Königsfeld 's daily intersection .	-5.4402
The commander was satisfied with the expiration of the exercise .	-2.3676
Network of universities and companies Important	-3.0489
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwick district , Landtag President Guido Wolf was also able to explain where the workers of tomorrow come from .	-5.7436
In the High Black Forest Support Centre , he joined the professional leaders of the professional schools as well as of the Kregymnasium and the chairmen of the parent group on this important issue .	-8.8145
" Education is an important location factor " , Claudia Standle , Director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project educational centre High Black Forest .	-5.9656
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-3.3662
Since 2011 , there has been a successful cooperation between the centre of the promotion centre , the gymnasium and the vocational training centre .	-6.5965
He also praised the kindness of his country .	-3.6743
" It is important not only to look at the family phase , but also to have the phase for care of relatives due to demographic change , Wolf explained .	-5.6070
He also said that more and more employees took care of the care and care of their relatives .	-4.7106
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to work relations " , Wolf said .	-3.9610
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers , he continued to say .	-2.2542
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-3.0422
" For whoever has already experienced the region ’ s benefits during his studies , his acquired knowledge and skills often remains to the regional economy , which contributes to strengthening the region , " the country ’ s president was convinced .	-6.9094
The fact is that only if sufficient training places were offered can the technical need be met .	-6.0418
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany , in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland .	-4.3025
In addition , on his railway journey from Titisee Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport .	-6.3841
" Stay stubbornly and make sure that local public transport becomes better , " he explained to the address of local politicians present .	-4.1259
Through music a entertaining afternoon .	-4.1943
For 15 years now the Kaul family has invited Diettinger Seniors to a coffee , cake and then a vespers .	-5.9097
In the past , the older citizens were occupied in the resting place .	-9.5443
Meanwhile this afternoon is taking place in the health resort of St. Josef .	-3.9491
The locals were delighted with the delicious cakes and gates .	-3.7356
Later , there was a salad .	-3.1443
With popular melodies , Silvia Kimmik-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich kept .	-5.1456
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall , as a precursor to the old school house to the Kirchstraße , facing the renovation cost of the city of Bräunlingen , is to be reinstated .	-8.3057
In the days before Kilbig , a small angel wall , the stabilization and static discharge of the over a hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrade was built in the first .	-6.4569
The way forward is for Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbahn to include the Landscape Office in the planning and a redevelopment concept for the old wall .	-8.4298
Afterwards , a cost calculation is to be made by professionals who will then be put on the table to the local government to decide and determine the next procedure .	-7.2140
A decision on this is expected to come next year .	-2.4185
After the reconstruction , coercion and construction of the old school ’ s interior courtyard within the two sides of the 1912 school , it is necessary to follow in the foreseeable future as a follow-up , the sanitation needy limitation wall must be restructured from scratch and new underconstruction .	-11.0215
The historical limitless wall of the old school house to the Kirchstraße , which dates back a hundred years , is mainly due to water and frost damage as no drainage is present , needs to be sanitized and has a bow line forward .	-8.8346
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is currently not stumbling .	-3.9705
A secure wall is a prerequisite for one of the students using the school yard , which has been done through the current fixing work .	-7.4997
Originally , the schooling was even planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure caused a postponement .	-4.9956
One important word in the historical school renovation , which has already been used for film recordings , will be the National Office .	-6.7623
In case of guidelines from this site , the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monuments guardians .	-6.8693
The students of the Bräunlinger primary school , who are now taught again in a well-heated old school building with new Aula , can soon use the old school house .	-12.0677
Özdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart .	-7.4395
In the ongoing discussions about the future of music colleges in Baden-Württemberg , Cem Özdemir , Chairman of the Greens , has now taken on board .	-4.3902
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic education in the Musikhochschule Stuttgart " , said Özdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.8510
Jazz and classical belong just at the jazz venue of Stuttgart .	-3.6017
Özdemir , who is Favorit in Stuttgart for a direct candidate at the German Bundestag elections on 22 September , is opposed to the Green Red State Government .	-8.3126
On the basis of an expert study , this research is pushing for a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-5.3846
The programme is planned to transfer Jazz and Pop from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the University of Music in Mann.	-6.1030
US border : ' super tunnels ' to drug smuggling are discovered .	-3.6708
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and closed a ' super-tunnel ' to smuggling drugs .	-4.0573
As the US customs authorities said , the trolleybuses between Tijuana and San Diego were equipped with electricity , railways , and ventilation systems for more than 500 .	-5.7354
Three suspects were then arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated .	-1.7887
The tunnel was not used as it was indicated .	-3.4216
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could get stuck under the radar , " said the US Secretary General of State Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference before a camp in San Diego , where an end to the tunnel was discovered .	-5.5117
Duffy assured the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money . "	-4.5813
Both the US authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent battle against the drug cartels .	-3.3861
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in the context of drug crime .	-3.2222
Configured by Experts	-1.8058
Due to the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the building was built around a year .	-5.0470
The sliding was so equipped that electric cars could be used .	-6.7605
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-3.2386
According to the authorities , a Head of 20 meters depth leads to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.9857
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters and 90 centimetres width .	-2.4618
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States .	-3.9137
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.8289
The Third , a Mexicans , was caught because of the confiscated marijuana .	-3.1608
All three threatens to be the maximum sentence of life long , as officials have said .	-3.3620
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and at the press conference in San Diego continued .	-3.6439
It is , however , the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel building .	-2.3523
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .	-2.6390
This shows the ' despair ' of drug gangs , whose traditional routes have now been cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug attack in San Diego .	-5.5811
They would do everything to reach the US .	-1.8390
The detainees were not given details , at least one was Mexicans , it said .	-4.1481
They have to face up to ten years of imprisonment .	-2.5170
In 2014 , Geisinger Fahrr	-3.9374
The Virgin of the City of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-4.5564
The reversal of the first clear mention is always closer .	-5.1898
If the year ends in a good eight weeks , the year will be the year for the year .	-5.8089
For the first time , 794 were mentioned among the hostages and church houses .	-5.5008
A document was made in churches , both of which are mentioned .	-4.0995
On March 15 there is to be an official start for the anniversary year , and as violins currently have no hall , this event will take place in the place where , for the first time in 1250 years , both were mentioned in church houses . .	-13.0328
A number of events are planned both in violin and church houses as part of the jubilee .	-10.1649
Kirchen-Haus will be 1250 in July on a weekend of 18 to 20 July .	-4.4842
We must celebrate return .	-3.1095
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall .	-3.1296
At this weekend the church house of the church is also situated .	-6.2763
Rudolf Barth has written a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is listed at three dates .	-5.4545
On June 21 , together with the Sonnendheier of the Schwarzwaldverein , on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 , the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-5.6462
This will be completed and inaugurated in the year of July , the official date is on the last September part-session , 27 and 28 September .	-4.9789
On the occasion of the Geiger Stadtjubiläum , a new chronicle is released .	-5.2297
" But a chronicle not only is to be made by violins themselves , but a printed work on today 's violin , which consists of violins , church houses , Leipzig , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen " , Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-8.6498
Today ’ s violin celebrates 2014 ’ s birthday , 1974 today ’ s space was also carried out with community involvement .	-5.7049
The new chronicle will then be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-6.9788
2014 , however , is also a year with many jubilities elsewhere .	-4.8600
The narrative Strahglonki begins on February 8 with a brewing evening on the occasion of its 60-year existence , the harmony of Gutmadingen becomes 90 years old and has the fenbanquet on March 29 , and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1 to 4 .	-7.2103
The Altenwerk Leipzig will be 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10 , the Musikverein Polymnia Leipzig will be 150 years old and celebrates this within the framework of the Brunnen Festival from 4 to 7 July .	-5.9790
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift document owned by St. Gallen Monastery in 764 .	-3.9849
The certificate was made in churches ( houses ) , which was then a place of jurisdiction .	-4.7756
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.2094
In 2014 , this 1250-year period is to be celebrate accordingly , in addition to the municipal council ’ s 40-year history .	-7.4436
The Council is targeting the rail market	-2.7542
Should the train pass " Am Hirschen " be extensively reconstructed to increase traffic security ?	-3.6862
Yes , local councils have decided .	-2.4960
Shintach has to bring 220 000 euros into his hands .	-6.0279
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal route next year .	-2.6277
In particular , safety at train outings is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles across the country .	-5.9265
If the communities agree to rebuild , they must take part in the cost by one-third , the rest share railroad and cod .	-6.6375
Schiltach Stadtbauer Roland Griegende explained to the Municipal Council the peculiarities of the Baignergangel " Am Hirschen " .	-6.6987
There , the city plans to build an exit at the height of the tunnel there west of the railway track .	-5.3545
There , even larger vehicles , such as those carrying long timber , could be in the offshore without having to block the tracks .	-7.8619
Greek rulers thus proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course to ensure smooth flow of traffic .	-6.1505
This has been controversial in the community , because some councils have doubled the need for road propagation : Thomas Kipp , with his statement , brought the mood of critics to the point : ' Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles ? '	-7.5143
Mayor Thomas Haas resisted : Hirschen 's railway pass is used regularly for long-haul transport .	-5.0491
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is transported partly through this route because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the route on the Häberless bridge because they could not turn into the main road .	-7.2323
Moreover , the route serves as a transit route for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-4.1249
It should be noted that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel should be reconstructed and reconstructed , as is currently the case in Wolfcomparcomparcomparcompartment , that the railway route " Am " Hirschen " could also be a major traffic significance for a longer period .	-8.3791
The Councils agreed to let us know what costs would cause the intended spread of the road .	-4.7298
Notwithstanding this , the majority of the changes in rail transport were agreed with the provision that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could expand the following road towards " Bahnhofstrasse " , if necessary , for congestion to about 5.5 metres .	-10.1022
The conversion of rail transport to the Gerreu Trautwein , on the other hand , could lead to a very different problem affecting access to the very growing " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-7.9452
The administration had to investigate the conversion plans of the train from the Breiteninger engineering office , because it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg could easily be achieved .	-7.8867
The investigation found that it was not impossible for the road to be broken to cause longer vehicles to rise .	-6.3535
The responsibility for this , in turn , lies in the city as a pavement farmer .	-6.0164
The restructuring could therefore lead to liability disputes .	-3.2139
As both the wood drain and the departure worked in the current state , Haas argued that it should not agree to the transformation of the railway .	-7.4565
Even at this point , the risk of a collision of the train with a car that is on the move is much lower than on the other train outputs , because the center itself is close to where there is a good view link .	-9.8969
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be shutted down to the point that no collision threat .	-5.8238
A majority of people were denied consent to the remodelling of the railway because the city of Schiltach had to " dismiss " the problem of sewering vehicles , the councils , since the train could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work .	-12.4764
As an unproblematic issue , the body considers the transmissions " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which cross agreements have already been reached with the railway .	-7.9430
Esa decides on big space missions : billions of missions	-3.5163
Far planets , gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency need to agree on two major projects that they want to start in the next few years .	-4.0208
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-2.4788
Far Worlds .	-1.7456
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-1.8644
Whether there are at least some of them , no one knows .	-2.1297
The selection is difficult : Are you looking for gravity waves ?	-3.0154
Or rather explore the origin of cosmos ?	-2.2477
Or , after dancing planets , perhaps to discover a life of extraterranean origin ?	-8.8176
These are the issues that the European Space Agency Esa is responsible for .	-3.9059
For her programme " Cosmic Vision " , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make research a significant step forward .	-5.5221
The budget for such " L-missions " is worth about EUR 1 billion each .	-4.0711
The launch is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.7179
In early September , Paris met the elite of European space research to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.2408
Thirty ideas have been discussed , five of them have now come into the narrower election .	-4.4508
Many bodies appreciate the proposals and look after the researchers .	-4.2233
In the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the Scientific Committee .	-3.0702
All four major questions have been selected by the Esa , to which the mission of the " Cosmic Vision " programme launched in 2007 should find answers .	-5.8315
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life ?	-1.1059
The exact events of the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the creation of planets that surround these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness .	-5.0705
A large infrared loop in all this could penetrate this darkness .	-5.1887
And if a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-2.8373
In order to address this question , 2017 will launch the space telescope " Cheps " , which will examine more closely the 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity .	-6.3663
But the possibilities are limited , Cheap is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.1781
With larger instruments , astronomers could form degrading planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , thus looking for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity .	-5.5703
How does the solar system work ?	-1.3641
This question , too , is intended to clarify the conditions for the creation of life .	-5.3094
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and its particle radiation with the planetary system .	-4.6321
In our solar system these processes can be investigated in an exemplary manner .	-4.3798
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already approved a M-class mission ( where the budget is around EUR 1 billion ) .	-5.1014
The probe will start in 2017 and watch the sun 's surface and activity carefully .	-9.0241
Jupiter and his monks are also of great interest to researchers .	-3.5729
You want to find out the role of the giant planet in developing the solar system .	-4.0609
For this , the Esa envisages the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme .	-9.8213
The song " Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer " is expected to commence its journey in 2022 .	-2.8408
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and should investigate the planet 's atmosphere , as well as the icy monds of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-5.1909
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.1430
The whole world offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to study whether the natural laws we know are still in force there .	-5.7567
Perhaps there are also deviations that could turn physicists into a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united .	-5.0517
How is the universe created and what is it ?	-2.5598
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos was created by the jungle .	-3.7884
In addition to the nucleus of matter , from the stars , planets and living creatures we insist , there are Dunkle Materials , whose gravity galaxies and galaxy clusters keep together , and Dunkle energy , which accelerates the expansion of the universe .	-8.9810
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the Ur scar , nor do they have dark matter and dark energy .	-6.5448
With the " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved a M mission which is planned to launch in 2020 .	-6.5714
With a special telescope , the probe is to investigate the distribution of the material in the universe for the first time in the whole sky , thereby enabling us to draw conclusions on the properties of dark matter and dark energy .	-7.2182
Who could do the race	-2.6688
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.9356
In the opinion of many experts , the best chances of being granted as a L-Mission are " E-Lisa " , a demanding concept for demonstrating gravity waves .	-5.5588
Physicists understand the changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-4.2084
They have not been proven up to now .	-2.1223
Elisa could do that , hoping the scientists behind the project .	-3.2143
The mission provides for one detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in all .	-4.2640
In contrast to plants on the Earth , it could also show gravitational waves born in the jungle , providing new insights on the origins of the cosmos .	-10.9347
Four other proposals still compete for the second L-mission : a large X-ray elescope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore , among other things , black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the Solar System , " Prime " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is intended to investigate and investigate the degrading planet .	-7.5074
Protest return transport from Mars , Mond , Venus and Asteroids , and sunphysics are already .	-6.1873
Snowden agreed to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-2.7552
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has explained that he is willing to travel to Berlin and say before the German Bundestag , when the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities .	-4.9319
The German Member , Hans-Christian Ströbele , met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where this asylum was received to discuss the statement in Germany with him .	-4.4041
In a letter from Snowden , presented on Friday by Strubele to the media in Berlin , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as a crackdown and attempts to criminalise political expression with a threat that cannot be defended . ”	-7.6765
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.5277
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American government to drop the charges against him .	-4.7088
The indictment exerted by the US Ministry of Justice includes spying and theft of state property .	-7.6273
German Home Secretary Hans-Peter Friedrich said online : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to speak to German representatives , we find ways to make this possible . ”	-4.2536
The relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that NSA has stopped the phone of Chancellor Angela Merkel .	-4.7245
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that one should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness when it is possible “ without endangering it and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-5.4751
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-3.7253
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.2992
Strife explained that , according to the lawyer of former NSA member Snowden , he could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-3.9854
If Snowden is issued in Germany , he will need an assurance that he is “ safe , ” said the Member .	-5.1919
Snowden explains in his letter that he was exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that displaced him from his home country .	-5.0332
It is , however , affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-3.4986
Citizens around the world , and senior politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a service to the general public .	-4.2392
In his letter , Snowden makes provision for cooperation to the German authorities “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation were resolved . ”	-3.8252
Frontier Airlines charges mobile baggage	-1.9395
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 of passengers who wish to escape hand baggage on their flight .	-3.6492
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , although it was read on Wednesday that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-3.9429
The new charge is for hand baggage baggage over the seat , small bags under the seat remain free of charge .	-4.3828
Frontier said that you will charge $ 25 if the charge is paid in advance , and $ 100 for passengers who paid only at the flight level .	-6.1830
Frontier screenwriter Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is to move travelers to pay in advance .	-5.2567
“ We don ’ t want to charge this amount , ” she explained .	-2.1806
Airlines began to charge charges for the first and second piece of baggage in 2008 .	-3.3684
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore applied as much as possible to hand baggage , which means that the luggage compartments are often overcrowded above the seat .	-6.1378
Charges are one way to make passengers move less on board .	-3.4830
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-2.1387
It is about the most loyal customers of Frontier , who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find a place in the field above the seat .	-5.9950
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline 's website must not pay .	-3.0957
This means that a passenger may be allowed to take a luggage free of charge on the flight level of Frontier , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of luggage .	-5.1303
O 'Malley said that the site of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they arrive at the flight .	-5.4895
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will not enter into force until summer , but there is no exact date yet .	-4.9785
Passengers often use baggage charges and other charges , but airlines are happy to do so .	-3.5781
They argue that baggage transport costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-3.5691
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .	-4.4409
Most of them leave the fingertips for hand baggage .	-4.2160
Spirit Airlines Inc. asked three years ago for first hand luggage charges , and later Allegiant Air was also a low-cost airline .	-6.7027
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , the airline adviser Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-3.5126
In a report of December 2011 , he estimated that the hand baggage fee Spirit will bring EUR 50 million per year .	-5.3975
Sorensen , who had previously held a leadership position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown with spirit and was curious about what would be expected of him at the flight level if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee .	-7.4970
“ The board process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-2.6843
I expected to see teeth knuckles and manageable discussions at the boarding slopes .	-6.4950
“ The aircraft was full , ” he said , “ and the board was as summed up . ”	-4.5751
Frontier is also followed by the $ 2 required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-3.5296
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or Saft should keep all the nose and that coffee is filled for free .	-5.7785
Water is free of charge .	-1.9527
US Airways had recently tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008 , but later reversed this seven months after passengers had complained and no other large society had ever been withdrawn .	-7.7089
Frontier 's move to charge hand baggage if passengers do not purchase directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-4.8820
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-2.8833
This will give all companies an incentive to move passengers to their direct purchases instead of an online travel agency .	-4.7276
Frontier , however , has gone furthest in this area .	-2.7075
In September , the company began to offer only half of the number of frequent flyer miles when booking via an online travel agency .	-5.4077
On Wednesday , the miles were again reduced to 25 % of the route .	-4.0082
For this reason , a flight with Frontier over 1000 miles , which is based on a third party , will only cost 250 miles .	-6.0143
Passengers can also reserve seats for direct purchases on the site .	-7.8917
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .	-2.4681
The revenue decreased by 9 % , and its capacity shrinked almost 13 % in the first quarter , as is read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-11.7638
Republic has tried to control Frontier 's finances as part of the company 's sale .	-3.8501
Emerging the Bible	-3.6672
Good 40 women attended the last woman 's breakfast this year in the Protestant parish of Biggen .	-5.5866
The theme of the day in the common area was " keywords from the bible " and " Speech from the Middle Ages " .	-4.9589
Zita Köhler , the Chairman of the parish council , entered the biblical proverb after breakfast .	-4.4348
" Say words contain habitat , rules , or warnings , " she explained .	-3.9235
She compared several proverbial words with the corresponding bidders and explained the meaning .	-4.4831
You called the proverbial words like : Holzauge is vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , an eye on someone throwing the ropes give the Lord in the sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-7.0365
Several times , the referenda also recommended their listeners , which provwere .	-4.9932
The Middle Ages used the parish of Christel Dehner : All good things are three , blue , and breathe something .	-5.5221
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges into the past ' .	-3.2922
At the end , a Tombola was lost .	-3.8501
The prices were covered on a table and were hundredfully wrapped before being handed over to the winners .	-4.5663
Among the visitors of the breakfast round there were the mayor 's story Roman Waizenegger .	-5.2230
Learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for underprivileged tourism .	-4.4848
At the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte , a pilot project for the tourism industry started .	-3.5418
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as an unskilled in the industry are to be trained to professionals in hotels and restaurants over three winter .	-6.3884
" Newly it is that the six-month courses end with degrees " , Carmen Wiechert said from the employment agency Neubrandenburg .	-5.2800
The benefits are multifaceted : participants would not be unemployed , the skilled professionals who have lost more and more in hotels and restaurants , and the agency should not finance unemployment .	-7.2442
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Guest House Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommer .	-10.0832
NSA explains a “ internal error ” and not hacker are to blame for the crash of the site .	-7.4813
The shameful National Security Agency said on late Friday that a mistake was made to its public website a few hours ago , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-5.3796
“ NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the SpionageAgency explained in an e-mail sent the message .	-6.2362
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.7510
The claim that the default was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) was not true .	-2.8499
In the early hours of the evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that is still not available to some users .	-4.9169
Before that , a NSA spokesman for ABC News stated that the sensitive internal network of the agency was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.7584
secret information is not in danger , the speaker says .	-3.4537
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.2663
In case of such attacks , the target site is flooded with page calls until the server is overloaded and the website collapses .	-3.6655
Cybertactic is relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to penetrate into the internal network of the target system .	-3.0262
The supersecret NSA , whose nickname once called No Search Agency ( No such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public , and looks at the revelations about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data released by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-8.3749
The growing controversy over the secret service provided initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-3.9613
The number of people without jobs fell by 22 to 1.307 in October .	-3.3775
While the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and even better than in September , ' we would have hoped for more ' , Monika Felder-Bauer says , Managing Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen .	-5.8476
Many companies have reacted to date to attitudes .	-3.0791
According to Felter-Bauer , one reason for this is : " We have little skilled personnel in the craft , health care and care of the elderly " .	-6.2125
Since September we have been working again on job opportunities for staff in the hotel and catering industries .	-6.7231
The winter season begins in mid-December .	-2.2863

Loss in Bombardier after declining supply figures and orders	-4.3314
On Thursday , Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturers Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percentage decline in net profits , after being put under pressure by declining orders and deliveries to third quarter aircraft and railway sectors .	-8.0139
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also published no flight test data for his brand new plane of CSeries and gave no new information about whether the aircraft could go to commercial use next September according to the ambitious timetable .	-6.7236
On the young flight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , only three more starts have been taken , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is as planned .	-6.7999
The results remained behind the forecasts and resulted in a rate of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-5.1009
Cameron Docersen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered its assessment of “ outfit ” to “ Sector Performance ” on Thursday with a view to having a limited potential for share in the next one to two quarters .	-5.8525
“ Although weaker delivery figures in aircraft were widely expected , we are clearly disappointed in the transport sector , ” Dokersen said in a customer letter .	-7.3361
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries if the aircraft test program continues .	-4.4660
If , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to be more sceptical about the programme .	-3.5858
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries ' aircraft series can catapulate the company to the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-4.9392
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and , after months of delay , came first in September .	-2.8883
So far , however , binding orders for the CSeries are moderate in 177 , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and see whether the company ’ s claims on fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet airplane are correct .	-6.8610
There are currently 403 orders and commitments of 15 customers and companies .	-2.4853
Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the Jet .	-3.8903
The company ’ s management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was in the schedule .	-5.2838
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference , adding , while the aircraft ’ s time was based testing and software updates .	-5.2268
Each manufacturer projects differently .	-2.4368
We have decided to embark on a first flight and then apply a period of processing which we have also done .	-8.3435
This is done throughout the entire flight programme .	-2.5486
The second of five test aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly after , it was said from the company 's side .	-5.1030
However , analysts remain sceptical as to whether , twelve months after the jungle flight , the first customer can make use of a CSeries airplane .	-6.2677
Bombardier explained that it review the planning for start-up ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-4.1137
“ The slow advancement of the flight test – even if it obviously corresponds to bombings of internal planning – reinforces our view that the commissioning of the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doksen .	-7.0203
In the third quarter at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net income fell to $ 147 million , or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share earlier in the year .	-4.1091
The adjusted profit per share is no altered 9 cents .	-4.5546
Sales soared slightly from 4.2 billion dollars to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.7387
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , said Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.9121
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-3.4577
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-3.3138
The order book in the airspace and airspace section was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September and was therefore unchanged against 31 December .	-4.6421
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were within the framework of our specifications , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-3.9208
Air and space sales fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-3.1704
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , has announced that sales in this savings have risen by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-9.8215
The order book in the transport saving stood at $ 32.6 billion on 30 September and thus was slightly increased compared to 31 December .	-4.3068
The transport profit range was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-5.0849
According to the Corporate Management Board , new guidelines will be set for the fourth quarter .	-3.4757
In the afternoon trade on Thursday , the $ 8.5 % bombardment stock stood at $ 4.83 , after it was announced that Google ’ s financial director Patrick Pichette will move to the board .	-7.5253
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and Bombardier ’ s closest rival , reported a ten-year decline on Thursday .	-4.7474

Cocaine addictor to warn the drug boss against police investigation must be imprisoned .	-4.8455
Basharat Ditta , 42 , continued information on Neil Scarborough subspace .	-2.5673
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light .	-2.8306
He was sentenced to three years ' imprisonment by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.4399
A well-known criminal activist who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction might be revealed was sentenced to three years in prison .	-5.2234
Basharat Ditta , 42 , hidden sub-world size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on his activities in the drug trade , after being compromised by his own cocaine disease . . the are . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.4022
The lawyer praised by criminals as a “ first class ” with the nickname “ Bash ” was arrested in 2011 in his house , after the police had overseen Scarborough , whom he had advocated in a previous drug procedure .	-7.8976
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three beutel cocaine at the bar in Blackburn , Lancashire , while with colleagues at a food of the Bar Chamber .	-5.6090
The investigation revealed that Ditta had regularly consumed drugs in class A after tests found traces of cocaine in his hair , letter and credit cards .	-5.6144
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorized information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.7111
All four suspects were then monitored by the police in the context of a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.2739
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police secured Heroin and cocaine in the value of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash .	-4.7115
Ditta , 42 , provided information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could be publicized .	-3.9263
Today , Ditta , working for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and sentenced on Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial in two prosecutors for obstructing justice .	-5.1768
He gave the cocaine ownership during a previous survey .	-3.2869
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in her investigation against Scarborough that in February 2011 he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta .	-5.0797
Two investigators followed the suspicion and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house and where drug-treated with a purity of 60 % in a black glow under the patron ’ s garments .	-7.5753
Shortly after he delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly calls Ditta , who was in the football stadium at Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .	-4.7746
The lawyer returned home , Drugs picked up , and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-4.4000
In court , Ditta was known to be a “ regular consumption ” of cocaine after tests of class A found in his hair , letter box , and credit cards .	-5.5681
Ditta was arrested later , but contested to take cocaine and said that he was speaking with the presumptive dealer because he was his client and claimed that her discussion was subject to the “ sanctuary of lawyer . ”	-7.1306
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were guaranteed and a hair sample was taken .	-4.4541
At police interrogation he admitted that he is operating an office and clients at home for legal matters , both under his private address and in the workplace .	-6.6056
Before the court , it became known that he had called for important drug-trafficking actors , some of whom had previously represented , and informed about what the investigators knew about them .	-6.7296
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal lawyer should know better than everyone else that the law should not be broken . ”	-3.2510
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , as he has admitted too much to certain clients .	-5.7167
The relationship in question is not simply a drug trafficker , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.7589
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-3.7206
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.7051
He worked against police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-4.6889
Mr Ditta has been questioning his profession .	-4.1171
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he admitted that his independence was compromised .	-2.4047
Ditta dissented and claimed that if I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do it immediately . ”	-6.5122
But after the hearing , superintendent Lee Halstead told the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta took the step from a criminal defender to a crime at the moment when he began to acquire drugs organized by criminals . . . . . . . . . ” the , , and . . . are . . . are . . ,	-17.4655
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him sensitive to the motives of the leading members of organized crime who enacted him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-11.6409
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public .	-2.0704
Ditta left that trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-2.8044
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to a condemnation in three cases on the ownership of cocaine and legal impairment , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-5.7745
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that none can escape the arm of the law .	-2.8883
We find you and bring you to court .	-2.0444
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being guilty of the conspiracy of heroin , cocaine and cannabis .	-11.1348
Fifty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .	-3.5953
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself , in which he approached his dream job as a lawyer to represent clients on death row in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-6.0793
Revolutionary Must	-1.3364
At the end of the celebration of the 160-year-old existence , the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two religious services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.3154
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which excited the spectators in the spring of this year , the Liederkranz will enrich two religious services at the end of the jubilee year with the performance of the Deutsche Messe of Franz Schubert .	-5.9194

The so-called Deutsche Messe , with the original title " singing for the celebration of the sacred victim of the trade fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and at the time of the inception was almost revolutionary .	-6.7476
The fair will be listed in the context of the services of the Gottes-Services , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-6.5399
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the Bäsergroup of the Musikverein Frohno Tennendron and Noemi Lobodi at the organ .	-5.3830
Haslach : Skepticism is growing confidence .	-3.8139
In 2015 , elections to the parish council will , for example , change basics in the Haslach ( SE ) naval authority .	-4.4262
Then there is only a common parish hall for all six parish streets .	-4.7309
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welzschensteinach prepared for the changes .	-4.5519
Because the basic decisions of the diocese no longer need to be changed and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-5.5540
During the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism toward the new is waning , but is increasingly futile .	-5.9332
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish area , the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main official Maritime Teams met .	-6.8578
On the basis of a presentation , Georg Schmitt described the new directives for naval units in the Archdiocese Freiburg .	-5.5737
Afterwards , as a church parish , the SE Haslach forms a body of public law , which enters into the rights and duties of the six individual church communities so far .	-6.3508
There will only be a common parish and a board in which the parish power office is represented .	-3.6485
Every parish court should have at least two elected members , in the six parish groups formed on the ground .	-6.5460
Your task will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the region .	-3.8472
There was a considerable need for discussion about the finances of the individual parish authorities .	-4.6806
The innovations foresee that accumulated amounts of funds are preserved in the parish order .	-7.3179
The liabilities , on the other hand , tend to affect the general public .	-10.1636
Particularly in view of the major planned investments , which then meet all the runways , there were major concerns .	-10.6995
" In the past , it was invested only in projects that could be managed by the individual parish houses alone " , relative Haslach 's parish chairman , Bruno Prinzbach .	-6.3861
Practical experience with a common body for five parish mates shifted Barbar Ritter , the chair of the body in the Seeldorf Unit Schutterwald-Neuried .	-6.0811
They had set themselves up in 2006 , " becoming one , remaining five , " and had to find that this is not as simple as that .	-6.6992
The authorities of the Haslacher Seeldorf Unit then decided to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish and the practical work of the community teams .	-5.4878
The work will be made concrete at further meetings and will be adopted in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.1138
In the end , the parish Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the naval mould unit , agreed by a clear majority .	-4.9693
In Püllendorf , the Electricity will become more expensive .	-4.6165
The citizens of Pflüllendorf must prepare for higher electricity costs .	-4.8480
As the manager of the city 's buildings , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the SUDKURIER , a four-star Püllendorfer family comprises between 70 and 90 euros per year .	-6.2141
The rise in the so-called EEG conversion from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour is an essential reason for the forthcoming price increase .	-4.2797
This relocation is reinstated every October by the four operators of the large electricity routes .	-5.5165
These provide the additional costs that they incur from the energy transition that they can incur through a shift over the electricity price .	-6.8312
The town of Püllendorf are the last link in this chain .	-3.3486
In its forecasts , the supervisory board of the energy company had even been preceded by a higher exchange , as reported by Jörg-Arne Bias .	-5.0708
Now the concrete figures would have to be calculated before the city 's buildings could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week .	-5.6005
" We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , so Bias , where the number will be close to the 2 cents .	-4.4898
Map of Daurot : Check with Wartetime	-5.0152
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not get green .	-2.9610
The traffic in the street does not react , or the sign of the light is defective . .	-9.1034
What should we do then - driving at Red ?	-4.4787
If a concerned had waited long enough at a red light and the cross is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart attorney Ralf Becker in the " Motorrad " magazine .	-4.1994
The waiting time must be " reasonable " , however , which could be interpreted differently from case to case .	-4.2613
Becker beats running for at least five minutes before the traffic lights are disturbed .	-6.1785
Those who continue the journey despite the red light must be aware , however , that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .	-6.4387
Those who are patient less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Supreme Court of Hamm .	-3.5749
In the negotiated case , a driver ignored the traffic light after about three minutes of Dauerot and had to answer for a negligent red light breach .	-6.5563
The lights were not broken , but jumped to green little later .	-4.6955
He was spared a travel ban because of the particular situation - not a fine .	-5.3317
The Common Council is pleased about solid budget	-4.2712
Whenever the budget is discussed in municipal meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-3.0687
The public purse in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the debt no longer knows the administration since 2005 .	-4.6085
In this sense , too , the 2012 financial year can be regarded as a full success .	-3.6391
This was evident in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts .	-2.7731
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was higher than planned .	-3.9647
The surplus of the administrative budget also amounts to around EUR 1.8 million over the approach .	-3.3323
Thanks to the surplus , it is mainly thanks to higher tax revenue and the share of the income tax .	-5.4651
The wealth budget , too , was clearly above the intended values .	-3.9182
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it amounted to EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.4451
" This is essentially due to the higher level of administrative budgeting , " said Rothmund .	-9.1854
Since less investment was made in the financial year 2012 than was planned , the repayment increase was also higher .	-5.1345
Overall , the overall reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-3.7091
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-3.2297
" Such a work does not shake you out of the sleeve " , praising Gerster with a view to the annual accounts .	-5.3662
He and the local councils were obviously delighted by the good figures .	-3.2402
It may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures could soon cost citizens dearly .	-3.3948
The good financial situation allowed the community to forego high rates in the past .	-4.0465
In turn , according to Gerster , subsidies have already been cut from the country on many occasions .	-4.6619
There are conditions for these grants from various compensation shadows .	-4.9352
Amongst other things , the towns and municipalities that apply for grants must issue certain levies .	-4.7821
" We have to look at the subject of hedges , as investments are being made over the coming years , for which we would like to have grants , " Gerster announced in this context .	-6.0451
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in the choir for 60 years .	-1.5697

In addition to the honorary , the 31st autumn festival took place in the usual course : with the MGV Insight , the Liederkranz Salzstetten , the Baisingen and the local music association , the Fullmaringer had invited a colourful mixture of choirs and singing styles that kept around 400 visitors .	-10.4330
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In the Wine Paradise " and " Lustig , their brothers " .	-4.6742
In order to celebrate her honorary Hubert Wermter , she prepared a small barn - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslie " .	-6.5287
The men 's association at Vier sang also received classic choirs such as " hunter 's " by Julius Wendt , " Weat , far away " by Hubert Goisern and the popular " When you go through the valley " .	-6.8096

Kenyan ’ s press revolves around controversial media law .	-3.1191
“ We are in a frightening position and we can ask ourselves : what does Parliament think of removing judicial independence tomorrow , ” was read in the newspaper , which does not consider the draft law to be constitutional .	-7.5503
“ The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it , ” says Cyrus Kamau , CEO of the Capital Group , including Capital FM , one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .	-3.9631
He said that the new media tribunal will always be biased , because it is an extended branch of government , and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.1975
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.5046

The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.4260

Moreover , the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on what it described as “ living blogosphere ” Kenya .	-3.3433
If they stifle the media , politicians could do unpunished whatever they want .	-3.9681
“ No one will ever know it , ” Mutuma Mathiu wrote , journalist at the nation , who describes the Kenyan media as a critical control factor in public life .	-5.3003

Kenya ’ s legislators have already dragged the public into the past .	-3.6974

According to Lexikon , Déjà Vu refers to a psychological phenomenon that is felt to have experienced or seen in a new situation .	-5.2608
In the case of the visit of the same name café at the Opschlag in the district district of Kleve in sight to the University of Rhein-Waal it does not have to remain with pure Déjà Vu sense .	-7.3208
After all , the cafe with its beautiful name aims to make a true stay not only in terms of thought , but also in a typical way .	-8.6255
Because it 's really fun and it 's beautiful .	-3.7238

For this , there are delicious cakes or individually lit fresh baguettes .	-4.3099
The owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the smart café at the Opstrike as gastronomy : in Kranenburg they led the " Art Lounge " .	-7.6636
The sympathetic coffee-lovers hope for more visitors from the move to Kleve .	-6.6807
Not least by the university .	-3.6933
" Whereas we do not have a specific target group , " Daniel Büttner stresses .	-3.4102
On the contrary , the two young students here want to address just as much as senior citizens and all ages between them .	-4.2062

After all , the harbour festival was rather outdoors - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.4529
But there was also the Ringnatzevening .	-4.9800
" Beautiful , successful and fun " , the two 33-year-old people found .	-3.7916
But it is not everybody 's business .	-2.6050
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not an excited fan of event evenings : " You can 't do all the right now . "	-5.6990
And with an event I 'm always talking only about those who are interested in the special event .	-3.2591
For this reason events will be the exception of us .	-3.1992
" We want to interrupt the normal operation as little as possible " .	-2.5367

UN proclaims new goals in combating poverty	-3.5366
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new targets to replace the Millennium Development Goals proclaimed 12 years ago to combat poverty .	-4.9461
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “ sustainable development goals ” that are to replace the Millennium Development Goals that are in 2015 .	-4.6326
They were included in the final draft of the document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-2.9571
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening at the summit that it was time to “ think out of national interests . ”	-4.2602
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process aimed at establishing universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.2616
“ These goals will be built on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 framework .	-3.6525
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by member states in order to achieve our vision of sustainable development goals based on the success of the Millennium Development Goals . ”	-4.3447
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the handball waiter still enjoys a good mood .	-4.9283
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this .	-2.7417
Everyone is still fully motivated with respect to the matter .	-3.1098
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.7836
" After all , I don 't know how to win , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.4913
Although the Third Requirements from Fredenbeck currently have no trees , Malmon will lift the pointer in advance .	-7.2192
I have trained many players in A-Junior .	-4.6657
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-4.3238
" In addition , it is important to see if there is a reinforcement from the first part , " the SG-Coach clarifies .	-6.3495
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must certainly increase in comparison with the previous performances . . .	-5.5427
Above all , it was a huge success in the debugging work and in switching .	-8.4039
Equal opportunity exploitation also definitely needs to be better .	-2.5468
So I hope that my players will finally have got their head free during the short break .	-4.2165
Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-2.8361
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of state and first President Mozambique , to vote for peace in a rare public demonstration .	-5.2782
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , CEO of an investment company .	-1.9519
For fear of the country ’ s future , it has exchanged its business mark against a t-shirt with the title “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined on Thursday of the amount on the capital ’ s independence square .	-14.4143
For nearly two weeks now , there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst offenders since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-3.7345
Renamo once was a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by the White Rhodesia and later South Africa ’ s apartament government in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.8811
Following the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.8269
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country will return to a full-blown conflict , but recent events have worrying foreign investors and locals .	-12.6453
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because discovery of huge deposits of gas off the coast and coal deposits in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from firms like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-6.4873
The ruling Freelimo Party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for tensions .	-3.2062
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the Sofala province on 17 October , a traditional stronghold of renamos .	-3.5899
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , told Renamos Speaker of the Financial Times .	-5.3894
The government blames Renamo for clashes and accuses the organization of having attacked soldiers .	-2.9952
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.3912
On AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama looked like “ losers , ” who “ wants to use all his remaining powers to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-5.2481
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.3462
But there have been increasing concerns since Mazanga was quoted in the words that Renamo acknowledged the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.7648
He said against the FT , so he meant that Frelimo did not respect the agreement any longer .	-9.3817
“ Our vision is to restart negotiations and to engage seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-6.9715
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tension caused by a series of clashes this year .	-3.8677
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who are joining the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique Expert .	-4.8622
None of them is good in bargaining , and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.3858
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reforms , has already said that she will boycott the municipal elections in November .	-3.0287
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.5300
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt to harshly move to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.7113
Renamos ’ electoral success has shrunk since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Movimento Democrático de Moçambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections .	-4.7695
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.1292
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.3741
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made worrying attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south connections .	-4.5446
Most of the property took place in the province of Sofia , which is located several hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale are using to export coal .	-6.1765
In June , Rio cut off the railways for one month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-3.7798
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-2.6315
Renamo wanted , “ the international community warned that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.7394
instability has increased the frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , Director of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already suffered as a result of corruption , slow progress in development and a recent wave of kidnapping .	-5.5493
“ People think that the government and president are responsible for the country ’ s future and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-2.7680
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.6471
“ No one is interested in Renaamo and Frelimo , they simply want peace and usable streets , ” he explained .	-4.5889
Children should receive myths and legends as “ models for life ” , says an author .	-3.8774
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal power has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Arthur legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-3.0346
Many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , offensive , and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught in schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland argued for a “ careful selection ” of ancient works .	-5.0627
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-1.4692
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.1127
He added that , with authors and teachers who are “ unduly didactic , ” children would “ completely shut down ” because , in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ subdued . ”	-5.9660
Crossley Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse myth and British Folk Tales , declared : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-4.9892
Perhaps the biggest difference between a adult author who writes for adults and an author writing for children lies in the need to express hope .	-4.2833
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an immense sense of good and evil .	-2.8808
It must be presented in a bottomless way , open to history and not declared .	-5.1815
This is the old story of the line rather than telling .	-3.5301
Hansjakob is once again in Freihof	-3.9369

He was received not only by the audience with a lot of applause , but also his sister Philippine welcomed him .	-3.5252
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly good to get involved in the role of the sister and gave her great life in Mimi and Gestik .	-4.9488
The Mühlenbacher ’ s regional Chapel played a select musical role between the scenes and thus rounded off the performance .	-8.1492
Haslach ’ s mayor Heinz Winkler then gave the honour to award the honorary , who , in representation of the then Chief Executive Officer Hättich , along with a part of the town council , made a warning . the were . .	-14.5546
The three king singers , who took Hansjakob to the exclamation , then made their warnings , " Oh as beautiful , since youth memories of my own three-king time are alive " .	-8.8124
With their song " O Jesula " they enjoyed the public on the Friday , as well as the story children with their loud " publisher , publisher " .	-6.1853
At that time , his criticism of the Church of office expressed Hansjakob as well as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization , or the effects of war .	-5.3948
In his hometown behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-4.3492
" A quiet spirit had finally found its calm and had gone forever , " says it at the end of the scene .	-5.0180
A lot of applause and many fine words were heard by the audience for the performance .	-3.9930

The Basketball project Hamburg Towers dispenses with an application for possible backwarders .	-4.0879
" We will not participate in the Wildcard process " said ex-national player Pascal Roller , who has established the concept of a proficiency club in the Hanseatic city since 2012 .	-4.3087
However , one of the first uprising was not heard from Ludwigsburg .	-4.4148
" We did not deal with the Wildcard process as long as it was not established that Düsseldorf was not granted a license , " said Neckar-Giant Boss Alexander Reil our newspaper .	-5.2904
Tickets can still be submitted to the arbitration tribunal until 23 May and prove its economic congregation .	-6.0418

They distribute the coal coming from the ships to stop .	-1.9817
The company has several iron in the fire at the site .	-4.0821

He said that NotW is using three procedures to research stories investigatively : telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-4.7733
The editor is personally involved in the third method .	-1.2595
It seems that he knows about the second , the surveillance , but it cannot be any other way .	-4.7194
What about the first ?	-1.3949

Meanwhile , former editors Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised Pawlby ’ s movements .	-2.6567
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voice email with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to speak to Charles . ”	-4.6576
Edis explained that coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as David Blunkett ’ s former interior minister .	-5.1137
The events heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman because of an affair when he was himself talking about the covenant Reekah Brooks who was married then .	-6.6295

The envoy of the Sheriff of Lowndes County came to the conclusion that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but which shook the family of the 17-year-old .	-5.7039
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” said Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , against FoxNews.com.	-3.0550
They would never have believed that he died as he did the Sheriff .	-3.9182
“ They believe that there is no logic that violates laws of physics and common sense , ” he said Crump .	-4.7721
Rather , they are convinced that the truth will be used to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-4.2364
“ Your son went to school to learn and came back in the arcade , ” he commented .	-3.6074
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , because a number of important questions remain unresolved .	-3.1203
What was the cause of death ?	-0.5260
Is his death caused by a crime ?	-1.7666
That said Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.6847
I follow the facts in which direction they also take .	-1.9520
My goal is to find out the truth .	-0.9723
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.0180
Moore said to reporters that initial autopsy suggests that Johnson had died of “ position-related fatigue . ”	-4.9591
But a second autopsy caused another cause of death , so Moore .	-3.2999
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-1.8372

CDC publishes allergy policies for schools	-1.9931
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of directives for the handling of food allergies among children in schools .	-3.2413
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government , as the number of school-paying children with food allergies is rising .	-4.0219
One in 20 children in the United States is now eating allergy .	-2.0278
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-7.9783
The guidelines contain information for schools that should raise awareness of food allergies to teachers and employees and how to treat children who show allergic reactions .	-4.7369
It is also recommended that schools have counseled Epinephrin – the auto-injection of the EtiPen brand is used most often – to counter a potentially lethal hypersensitivity response .	-6.1564
The legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can make it easier to keep Epinephrin in .	-5.1653
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction .	-2.2615
Children may say : “ It feels as if something goes to my tongue ” , “ My tongue feels like a hair on it ” or “ My tongue is crazy ” .	-5.7104
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender unequal ”	-3.1568
Germany is the first European nation to recognise a third gender for children born with unambiguous genitals .	-2.9423
New-born is no longer male or female .	-3.6737
According to the new law , parents no longer have to explain sex to such children , but may indicate “ unequal ” or “ not established ” on birth .	-5.6261
The aim of the law is to put pressure on parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on sexual exploitation operations in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersex people .	-5.8336
One intersexual person said BBC years later : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.5521
I remain the patchwork created by doctors , mutilated and full of scars .	-3.3130
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year are neither a boy nor a girl .	-3.5852
They are among the intersex , a group that falls under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation ” ( DSD ) , a collection term for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( oak or hoden ) or unusually developed genes .	-5.7098
Wallis Simpson was perhaps intersexual .	-1.7526
The understanding of gender certification is still not very well developed , but most US experts recommend using the best available information on gender allocation if it is not possible , rather than waiting for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding , if at all , for an operation .	-7.0615
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender denial , said the new German law “ sounds after a good thing . ”	-3.6284
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.5319
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not , ” he said .	-2.8819
You can do a gender assignment without operation and wait for the identity to develop .	-3.7871
The scientific data about how a child develops his sexual identity at all is not very accurate .	-3.0250
No one knows why it happens .	-1.7081
It is like the mystery why people are homosexual .	-1.8859
In a report to the European Commission dating from 2011 , it says that intersexual people are different from transsexual or transgenic people , because their status is not gender-based , but rather because of their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-7.0649
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , control , breast and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosomes and hormones .	-4.5129
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transcender-persons in professional life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice criminality .	-5.0211
Not with the sex image identical boys now have a special camp .	-3.7399
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to appear on official documents male , female or “ third sex . ”	-4.0983
In June , Australian Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ sexless ” person , after a court had admitted the lifetime maintenance of a “ non-fixed ” gender status .	-4.6467
German identity cards have a third assignment , X for intersexual , i.e. the Ministry of the Interior .	-3.9826
In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , such as a news release to France 24 .	-3.1157
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from books .	-3.2343
The US Site Catholic Online has also opposed the German law on the grounds that “ if the world is torn into a new state where sex is a decision , but sexual activity is not , then we turn out two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-7.2669
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone , she would do better if babies were allocated a sex at birth .	-3.5443
“ The parent ’ s roof is ready without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your own child , ” she said the parent ’ s website .	-5.5168
Children need stability and security .	-0.7228
Historically , children born with both male and female gender groups were called hermaphrods , according to the attractive Greek god who had both sexes .	-4.8980
Ten years ago , medicine looked at the sex as something to remove and rebuild .	-3.3717
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being challenged , after it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels when grew up with the sex they confer .	-6.5401
“ In the mid-twentieth century , one called this a psychiatric emergency , ” Drescher said .	-3.8419
When such a child was born , it was not called the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-2.9585
The dominant theory of the treatment of children with unambiguous genitals goes back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who argued that the sex is formable .	-4.7984
He coined the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental concerns – such as parents educating a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , and pretended to be a person as male or female .	-5.8992
But in a case known as “ John / Joan ” in 1966 , his theories were controversial .	-2.9446
He called upon the parents of a boy whose penis had been detained in a venerable circumcision , to register the child completely , and also to remove his hoden , and then extend him as a girl .	-8.0191
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation that he was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.4254
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.5030
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-1.3888
According to Dresden , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.2185
But in the 1990s , with Internet access , survivors of these sex operations have appeared to the public , which are “ unhappy with the result . ”	-4.3060
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36 year old author from Montana , born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-3.4415
Doctors were not aware of whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-4.9336
So his external organ and the hoden were removed shortly after the birth of 1976 chirgych , and was extended as a girl .	-6.4823
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.1768
“ I knew I was not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com	-2.4692
I was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.6654
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginoplasty .	-3.2014
But , because he was depressed and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical acts .	-3.6925
What he found out was shocking .	-1.0574
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one ever told me .	-2.1661
Bruce was born with a DSD that could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genitals .	-3.0005
After learning the truth , he turned back to male identity , gained Testosteron injections , and allowed his breasts to be removed .	-6.4321
The surgery makes it infertile .	-2.2560
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersexual people as normal .	-4.4442
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Chief Executive Officer of the California legal group Advocates for Informed Choice , assures that the German law can “ encourage stamps and embroideries . ” .	-13.5672
“ Many activists are concerned that German decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and to teach the child not to set it , ” she explained .	-6.3474
We fear that it will benefit from intervention .	-2.1038
We think it would be better to assign male or female sex and then wait .	-3.4329
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.2456
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to be recognised as a third gender . ”	-4.5907
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.4468
German law is about referral at birth .	-2.3915
This is not a battle to force small children to join at this time .	-3.8181
When they grow up , they can choose their own bodies .	-2.7123
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a member of Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation and who supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ empowering ” both parents and children .	-5.1944
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD named full Androgenic resistance .	-3.7424
Because of the recipe feature of the target cells for testosterone , catie developed female characteristics .	-4.7330
It has a vagina , but not a uterus or an oak .	-2.7046
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a child ’ s psychiatrist .	-10.7720
Although it is infertile , it is hoped to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-4.1239
“ The law provides space for parents , meaning that they do not need to take hasty decisions , ” said Baratz .	-4.6524
It gives them the time to do different tests and to clarify things and gives them time before writing “ male ” or “ female ” .	-4.0759
In this way everything is fine – you draw the child large and love it .	-4.7129
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy your parents ' happiness .	-2.8041
And you don ’ t need to hasten an operation that can no longer be undone .	-5.1009
“ This includes the children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents have been killed because they believe they do not do the right thing ” , she explained .	-5.9158
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that fits him better – and that is wonderful .	-3.2531
This will enable children to take the decision themselves .	-1.9192
Involved girls by car shot	-3.4632
Unknown have violated a customs year in Sachsen-Anhalt at shots from a car .	-6.1619
The perpetrators had probably fired on a group of children on Thursday in Ghent with an air pressure force .	-3.5060
This involved the police in castle .	-2.9047
The girl was easily injured on the left bank .	-2.4910
The rescues brought the girl to the hospital .	-3.3534
The shot came from a small car , which was on a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-3.7560
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.8996
The perpetrators also insisted on a bus stop .	-2.3710
A disc was broken down .	-2.6122
Then they left .	-2.5947
The crime list was found on Friday .	-4.5929
Until now , the police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-3.3122
The officials were only called upon twice to earn children who were fighting home facades .	-7.1700
Because home owners identified this in good time and removed the egg equals , no damage would be incurred .	-6.8848
In addition , some shelters were bred in the city , but here too no damage was done .	-8.1566
A native of the Bishop had reported that his car was transposed with cloth paper and turned out to be dirty .	-9.4277
Until the police arrived , however , the man found out his bike problems in the immediate vicinity of all , so the police had to stop working .	-7.3004
Residing with a Future Perspective	-7.0475
In fact , Walstad Giant is truly alive .	-5.3680
The house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old building , nice neighbors and not too much traffic .	-4.7274
It is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-3.3263
" You hopefully have no fear of spinning ? " , Walstaid Ries asks and demonstrates a fat spinning on the door frame .	-6.5583
I have been searching for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time now .	-2.5148
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-2.0472
However , the reason is not a spinning phenomenon , but the concern that at age the many stairs to the house and in the apartment can no longer be overcome is explained .	-6.0486
In addition , since a meniskus operation , the centrepiece has had to know on its own body what it means to move to a floor with a handicap .	-7.2687
Only recently is a book published by her on the subject ' lucky living at age - Which form is the best for me ? ' .	-9.1684
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not happening at night ' , it starts telling them .	-4.3303
When she moved into the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , she was simply a nice apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.5021
Today , with the middle of fifty , Walstaid Ries thinks otherwise .	-4.7097
She also knows that she is one of the few people who are really dealing with the issue of ' living at age ' .	-4.7135
Most of them are ruin as long as it is .	-4.2414
Old are always just the other , she says dirty .	-4.6572
If the pressure of suffering is really big , think is possible .	-4.9833
'Then it can be too late ' , so Giant .	-3.9458
In their book , the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-determined living at age .	-4.8383
'Which form of housing you choose is always an individual lesson ' , explains it .	-4.3514
D i e solution there is not for the age .	-2.3114
Even those who can afford the age rest in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider being ill .	-4.8559
And : ' Without good knowledge of the national language , you also unite in Dolce Vita , ' give consideration to the co-authors of the technical book in foreign agreements .	-8.8274
Among its models are classic treatment models , alternative types of housing or the often cited pensioners ’ WG .	-6.1163
At age everyone has such tickets and Macks .	-3.4600
'For me , such a community would be nothing ' , she means with an eyewear .	-9.0674
Not at all like in a Studenten-WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-3.2372
'At age you simply need the space of retreat ' , so Giant .	-5.5603
The buyers do not want to exclude the fact that a senior housing community can still function .	-5.3106
This should then be different from that in the classic Studenten-WG .	-4.5897
And sometimes you just want your calm , you think it .	-4.1025
It does not stand alone , at least in the Capital of State .	-3.7422
" Most of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own house " , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the leader of the citizen services life at the age of the state capital .	-5.2685
Your department advises people around the subject of ' becoming older ' .	-3.2589
That is why older people , in particular , would often find inconvenience and restrictions , only to be able to stay in their habitual environment , and that is also the experience of the Foundation Ware . .	-7.3595
There are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible .	-3.4847
Giant recommends to all those who are concerned with the age-like rebuilding of their house or apartment , first of all , to inform themselves thoroughly and not to instruct the best craftsmen .	-9.1024
Today , there are also specialists for the age-just rebuilding .	-4.9210
Even in the apartment there is one room or another , and if it is only the toilet lift lift , the interior designers are clarifying .	-6.7446
But it is not always possible to transform the existing apartment in an age and thus make it more accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .	-6.5968
This experience had to make Walstad Giant .	-3.0937
The apartment could be equipped with a staircase , but it would be much more .	-8.2594
She will search until she found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-3.0023
Before she moved , she greeted her more than she had a spine at her front door .	-6.9015
The US wants to pursue Snowden ’ s continued prosecutions	-2.9636
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence worker Edward Snowden .	-2.6339
He will continue to be accused of disclosing secret information without his permission .	-4.6540
That is why he must face a criminal trial in the US , said the spokesman of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-5.1144
The recent statements by Snowden would not change anything either .	-4.2694
Prior to meeting Snowden in Moscow , Germany ’ s founder politician , Hans-Christian Ströbele , appealed to the US not to threaten him with punishment again .	-4.9675
Psaki emphasized that the words of strife are those of a parliamentarian rather than that of a German government member .	-5.7922
Senior Service Provider Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities .	-4.3532
But first he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.7989
This is what former NSA staff , sought by the United States , made it clear in an unaddressed letter that the founder , Hans-Christian Ströbele , published on Friday after a meeting with Snowden , and passed on to the Federal Government , Bundestag and Attorney General .	-6.6565
According to a translation used by Strubele , the letter follows :	-4.2854
The Responsibility	-9.1902
I have been asked to write to you about your inquiry on mass surveillance .	-2.5451
I called Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .	-3.6572
As a result of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic lawbreakdown in my government , which caused me to act as moral duty .	-6.0074
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and persistent vein that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-3.8378
I am currently living in exile and having temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-3.3087
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-1.9845
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations to a system of all-embracing surveillance , which is not accountable to anyone , as a service to the public .	-4.8731
This espionage revelations reflected many proposals on new laws and policies aimed at the unprecedented misuse of public trust .	-5.0953
The benefits for society from these acquired insights are becoming increasingly clear , while at the same time , the risks that have been bought have been clearly diminished .	-6.7001
Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a fidelity , seeking to criminalise and charge political expression .	-5.5651
Yet the truth is not a crime .	-2.7933
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this abusive position . .	-4.5010
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate in the responsible awareness of the issues relating to the statements made in the media , in particular with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports , appropriately and legally .	-5.7695
I look forward to a discussion with you in your country as soon as the situation is cleared and I thank you for your efforts to preserve international law which is protecting us all .	-11.9134
Edward Snowden testifies through Hans-Christian Ströbele .	-2.4889
Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-1.1825
" The building is in good hands " says Winterlinger Mayor Michael Maier .	-2.1967
The former kindergarten in the garden street sold the community to a private person .	-4.2828
The sale was in the public domain at its recent meeting .	-5.7410
The building changed its owner at a reasonable price .	-2.2800
" The village is satisfied " , said Maier .	-3.1562
The budget was 100 000 euros .	-2.6660
Not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former nursery .	-2.9233
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over the responsibility for the building prior to winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to keep a eye on the garden and to clean the walk .	-8.4626
" This effort is now away " , Maier is pleased .	-3.6940

Report : Obama ’ s campaign veiled to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton .	-2.8868
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have quietly considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden in 2012 with Hillary Clinton , the New York Times .	-3.6978
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heiemann on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-9.6134
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and they reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had carried out “ large group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 , ” to find out whether it would be better for Obama ’ s diminishing hope of re-election when he leaves Biden .	-7.5909
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ s nationalist correspondent , the book paints in a thorough manner the history of the efforts of leading campaign and White House officials , namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect on poll values that former Secretary of State Clinton should exchange with the Vice Presidents .	-7.7171
The potential shift was a closely maintained secret in the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office .	-4.2383
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , the former Leader of Campaign Obamas , Jim Messina , and the White House ’ s former senior advisers , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the proposed change .	-5.0167
In “ Double Down , ” Daley said that , despite her “ close , personal relationship , ” it was said that Daley was at the forefront of the effort to exchange Biden , before finally choosing to do so , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-9.0666
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing bites with Clinton .	-3.2760
“ I mentioned a whole range of things to be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.8898
It must be remembered that the President had terrible poll values at the time , so we thought : “ To God ’ s will , what do we ? ”	-3.7770
While Daley called the studies “ offered care , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort had been made during the campaign for re-election to determine whether such a train would pay for the ballot box .	-12.7841
“ In campaigns , don ’ t spend so much money on polls and focus groups if you don ’ t really think about something , ” Martin explained to AC360 .	-4.1788
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about an exchange .	-2.2970
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley whether his then boss knew about the potential change .	-2.7862
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was “ conscious ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” to know Obama .	-10.0392
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political probes had reached a desk .	-3.9162
Cooper asked Martin if he thought that Obama did not know anything about whether to leave Biden in the elections .	-4.4705
“ Possible ” , Martin replied .	-2.7662
What happens on the go with my email ?	-2.3804
E-Mail actually means electronic letters .	-7.4362
Is the design of the Internet service email similar to conventional mail technically implemented the mail secrecy ?	-5.3462
In the concept of early Internet services , the emphasis was on making communication possible .	-4.1022
For this reason , the basic technical protocols have not been taken care to create a stable foundation for an interrogate exchange of letters .	-6.8809
Therefore , a conventional email corresponds more to an open postcard than a folded letter .	-3.9336
When user " Anna " sends an " Benni " a mail , are the computers of the two connected directly ?	-3.8507
The email program or the Anna browser sends the mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step .	-2.9100
If , for example , it has a GM account , it would be Google .	-3.0408
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni .	-1.7894
On the route the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet .	-4.7025
Bennie can call the content to his provider .	-3.5739
Are conventional e-mails read across the network ?	-3.0166
Most emails are read by software robots on the move .	-2.7037
For the provider of the sender , it is usually checked to see if the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment .	-6.8470
A virus-check is also performed on the receiver systems .	-2.9476
Moreover , the provider will check whether this is a annoying and undesirable spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least missorted into a spam folder .	-6.0682
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.6143
For systems such as GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.7346
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holiday trips , Google can display links to holiday offers .	-5.9456
Do unknown people also read the emails ?	-3.3529
The likelihood that unauthorized persons will read a mail is extremely low .	-9.2359
In theory , however , this is possible .	-1.8104
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-3.8229
The law enforcement agencies and secret services also have legal opportunities to catch or note e-mails .	-4.9290
And there are potential illegal offences .	-4.3825
Is it possible to protect e-mails against fellow citizens ?	-2.7611
By encrypting the OpenPGP standard , e-mail can be encrypted effectively against fellow readers .	-5.6632
With high technical effort it is also possible to obscure the metadata of an email communication , so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom .	-6.3234
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-1.3171
Yahoo and Google only play a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes , according to a survey by Consulting from August 2013 .	-5.5034
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail last fell , GMail could tell Google .	-4.4295
Mother in the Forest Crashed and Rent	-3.2007
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-3.3240
He killed the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care money .	-4.0072
To be able to cashier further , a 67-year-old Wolfburger has buried his dead mother after police investigations into the forest .	-5.0774
First , he lost the death of the 89-year-old , then he won the money for more than one and a half years .	-4.6472
Now the 67-year-old Member is responsible for fraud , as a spokesman said on Friday .	-3.5317
Thus the man hid women in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.9660
The man was already suspected in May : back then , it was obvious that no more medication was needed for the mother in need of care .	-6.5932
The pensioners told them that his mother was to Spain .	-4.0837
Because the officials made this strange , they continued to receive it .	-3.5151
The two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and it was last maintained .	-5.6282
The 67-year-old finally gave the death of his mother .	-2.9069
Obduation , according to the police , found no evidence of capital crimes .	-4.0640
Do you want ice cream that light in the dark ?	-3.9128
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice in the dark – using quality .	-4.0664
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of marine animals and made a shining lick .	-4.7906
The idea came to him after he had read a research about quality and persuaded Chinese scientists to make the shining protein artificially .	-6.8292
The ice cream responds to consumption with the tongue , raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the lighting .	-3.9470
Chris explains that the food responds to the heat in the mouth and light – the more you leak , the brighter it becomes .	-4.7341
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company " Lick Me I 'm Delicious " , says : " The product is incredible , but still in a very early stage of production , so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . "	-4.3303
The protein used in the ice cream responds to the tongue with a neutral pH value .	-2.4331
When the mouth heat the protein , the pH value and the ice lights rise .	-2.9433
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed to us ideal to put it on Halloween because it has this wonderful lightning effect .	-4.3163
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced , because the quality luminaire is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.4784
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.6188
But for that it tastes delicious .	-2.8629
Charlie 's experimental company with headquarters in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-3.8832
But his latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-2.0543
He says , ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ’	-2.5386
This is impossible in itself because of the lighting break caused by the ice crystals that make up ice cream ; but I suspect we will find a way to create it .	-5.3690
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a hurdle manufactured by Chinese scientists .	-3.9571
TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball League after six days .	-2.6276
It is now expected for the team of Ingo Ehler tomorrow to be the Derby against TSV Daverden , who won his first victory last weekend .	-5.3346
With this game the season begins new for us .	-2.1490
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " Ehler 's behaviour is optimistic .	-4.6822
He finally made available his complete cader , except for the permanent injured Hendrik Blohme .	-5.3350
We also use this as tempo game .	-5.3897
Therefore , we must keep our error rate low .	-2.6050
First of all , however , we need to increase the coverage that has left everything but a safe impression .	-5.5891
Daverden Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season against Northern horn .	-4.9843
The game was of course a house number .	-1.5104
But that ’ s why we ’ re not the favourite , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-4.9559
However , Panitz wants to appear in Morsum to start a series .	-4.5846
The absence of Jan-Malte join .	-3.6100
For this purpose , the A-Juvenile Joost Winds Committee , active in the A-Jugend-Bund Lighthouse HC Bremen , celebrates its seasonal offer .	-7.0699
Anyone who is not hot in this game should stay at home .	-3.4620
Halloween 2013 : In numbers	-1.6961
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.6634
My sister and I have been allowed to eat sweets , stay late and eat for the neighborhood .	-4.5306
Today I have rather become an Halloween-Muffel .	-3.0928
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute from my apartment from sweet things , and I am sure I will not do so this year .	-5.8358
However , according to statistics , I am a black sheep in terms of Halloween .	-2.7825
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be exact – are celebrating Halloween this year , with a total of $ 6.9 billion in sweeteners , costumes , and decorations , the US National Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-5.0022
One thing that I am looking forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-4.2032
The costumes will account for approximately 1.2 billion dollars spent , the NRF .	-3.5456
This year , exciting unanimated items are the last cry .	-4.2119
Women no longer have to hide themselves in sexy clothing , they can now embody tempting food like pizza , hamburgers or cartoons .	-4.3820
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Dawn punk space banner will create it in the Instagram feeds this year .	-4.7238
According to Google , most commonly used costumes are Zombies , Batman , Pirates and Hexes .	-2.8996
I suspect it is not a bad thing about tradition .	-3.2043
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone in my surprise .	-3.4934
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , the NRF .	-2.0279
These are a lot of “ Hot Dogs ” . are . are . are . are . . are . .	-7.8364
We are not cimperable when it comes to candy .	-4.4736
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielson Company .	-2.2937
These are about 270 million kilograms of chicken , lutschs , bonbons and rubber bears .	-6.0276
So good news for the US Trade Ministry ’ s $ 41 million people who move through the quarter by saying “ sweetness or saures . ”	-6.3358
In fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not fool – eat .	-3.6148
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar candy corn , yet 15 million kilograms are sold by Halloween , the national association of sweeteners .	-3.6276
That is about nine billion Maiskirner .	-5.3237
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.1879
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it splits .	-3.3082
They have great names like “ Terrorist Behind the Walls ” ( which is , moreover , in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-5.0125
There are actually 1,200 official lockhouses in the United States , which generate $ 500 million , as America Haunts , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are playing in the trousers and then putting your friends on Facebook , where you will not get rid of them , and one of the type on which you stand , leaving a comment like “ net face pressure ” .	-10.2751
But we finally come to the pumps .	-2.7920
Charlie Brown trusted us with the big kick when we were children , and the schnitze of a pumpkin latine is like the buttocks of Christmas tree – something that we made from small .	-7.5567
Fortunately , only last year , thanks to Pinterest ’ s “ baby in the Körbis ” trend , so that most of us have grown up to cultivate the cucum and not to sit in it .	-6.6874
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on Küsbise , the US Census Bureau .	-2.9023
The Kürbilatern , which slowly disappears in the Vorgarten , probably dates from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of Kürbise were harvested this year .	-6.9933
If you want to be right , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut some chickens from their 921 kilo heavy pumps .	-4.5461
Window fire in Helmbright : Heavy forces cause spouse .	-6.2450
The fire brigade had to break in Helmbright on Thursday night .	-5.3412
A three-family house in the district of Hof starts fire in the night to Friday .	-4.1723
The rescue forces are making a scourge from the house .	-4.8526
In the case of a fire in Helmbright , rescue forces have found a scary leak in a three-family house .	-7.3464
Whether it ’ s a person ’ s hand is unclear , as a spokesman for the police in Bayreuth said .	-3.9583
At the late Thursday evening it was burnt on the ground floor of the house .	-3.6811
When the fire brigade hit , the flames beat from a window .	-4.5886
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.3762
This and another room was completely extinguished .	-3.2150
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.8690
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spokesperson continued to say .	-3.1188
The building was not inhabited until now .	-9.6269
The exact cause of the fire was not clear first .	-2.7214
Germany ’ s largest town church has an offensive to advertise the profession of the pastor .	-5.1627
The background is a possible lack of path : the Gospel Lutheran Church of Hannover expects the number of its current 1,800 pastors and pastors to halve by 2030 .	-6.7460
For young people today the profession is very attractive and offer good prospects for the future , Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) said in conversation with the gospel press service .	-4.0252
It is attractive to be able to determine the workflow and the workflow itself .	-4.0694
With Burfien , the National Church has for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full place to inspire young people for theology study .	-5.2236
At present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after the ab.	-4.4900
Burfien returns this to the process of de-eclipse : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is written " .	-5.2835
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.6660
I am Mr Terminal , and I can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-5.4117
Pastors could be very close to the people as nautical gardeners .	-4.4868
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-3.5338
Certainly , more money is paid in the free economy , but for that , theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.2582
This is what the young people of today are looking forward to , not just for careers , but for a meaningful job .	-6.1617
According to the National Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , about 60 pastors are currently in a retirement year .	-9.5124
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their Vikariat .	-3.7624
In sparsely populated marginal areas such as Harz , Emsland , or Wendland , it is difficult to occupy jobs in future .	-4.4052
Among other things , Burfien wants to organise days of study for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-4.9493
The theology study offered a broad education .	-3.4112
It can even be a federal President .	-3.8872
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.5141
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as an outdoor telephone station .	-6.0737
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package providing support for Bowler works-mechanics and logistical support to vehicle invitation between events .	-4.5966
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.2046
They are not all experienced drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure , as well as for an accessible way to world-class events .	-10.5580
We are happy to open this way to partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare new people for the streets and the reality of Rally Raid .	-5.1737
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – a entertaining championship .	-4.1269
In addition , the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February , as well as the option of participating in desertification races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.6210
Fire defense called for the rescue of a chicken , 15 meters above the ground ground , standing in a quarry on a dangerous rock advance .	-8.5911
CockerSpaniel Hündin Ruby went off after a minor road accident .	-4.4534
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in her unfortunate location in the quarry .	-4.2853
Firemen disembarked on rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death .	-4.2745
The Fire Defense was able to secure a chimney that was on a 15 meter high lead in a rock wall .	-7.3076
The nine months old Cockerspaniel Hündin Ruby had gone away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before being saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.9012
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs came to the Quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire , to welcome Ruby again and thank the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-4.4473
They had desperately looked for their missing hundin and published the use of aid in social networks when they had escaped the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-7.6246
About 14 : 15 pm on Wednesday saw a walker who performed his dog , the suspended Ruby on the 15 meter high paragraph in the quarry .	-6.6476
The cleckheaton Fire Station ’ s technical rescue team was there , and was there to save Rubys , who was then transported up in a dog box .	-6.9397
Andy Clayton , the specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ It was in a dangerous situation .	-2.3682
It was situated in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from above and the ground .	-3.6631
She moved no muscle during her rescue – she was like steep-frozen .	-3.8391
But now it is going well .	-2.0237
She then drunk a few dog cakes .	-3.5001
That was quite unusual .	-2.5718
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible .	-1.3241
Peter Lau , the specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a giant turn in English . ”	-3.8336
It was possible that it was very badly injured or worse .	-3.2398
Ruby was brought to the vet , but he did not establish anything except exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.3908
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said , “ To be anxious to see the rescue . ”	-3.9413
I could not believe that she was really there above .	-3.0455
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor .	-1.6866
The vet said that if exhaustion had become too large and if it had collapsed , it would probably be crashed .	-4.1478
Fireworks have done great things .	-10.2141
It was really brave what they did .	-2.2634
We are simply so grateful and everyone of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.7093
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that it would fall , but it remained up . ”	-2.6409
Firemen were great .	-1.9632
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.4616
Mick Jagger says he never registered Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.9963
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a background singer on Jagger Song “ Old Haits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-5.2643
Perry said she had dinner with the altro and that “ he offered me when I was 18 . ”	-4.3005
She added : “ It has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-3.3221
In a statement , a representative Jagger , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically understands that he has ever made approaches to Kathy Perry . ”	-4.7904
The representative added : “ Maybe she confused it with someone else . ”	-2.1440
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at this year 's Rolling Stones Tour .	-3.2118
Their new album „ Prism “ landed on first place 1 this week .	-3.3272
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives Scots the Election	-2.0772
A new day , a new frightening history for independence .	-2.1583
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.0233
This provides the keyword for stories about passcontrols in Berwick and a sheltered border along the Hadrian Forest with barbed wire .	-5.8302
In fact , in the Strathczyde proposal , attention was drawn to the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe , but this , as expected , played no part in the headlines .	-6.4822
Nor did anyone mention that EU member states often run their strict rules when it is more favourable to them .	-4.5564
As Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , continuing non-compliance for Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Scots .	-5.3842
So no story really .	-2.2462
And one that came in the years that she already equated to a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” -duck at least 40 years ago .	-6.0871
An interesting point is being lost in the recurrence of this ancient story .	-4.4803
Why should an independent Scotland expect it to fall under the European pillar ?	-2.6884
Why to exchange London 's yoke against Brussels , especially now ?	-2.6156
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan for European unification has stalled .	-2.9564
With the euro crisis , the European project officially died .	-2.8487
Parties across the EU are gaining ground that is anti-EU or want to throw the euro over board as a common currency .	-4.0786
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party Alternative for Germany – first founded this year – took just five million votes in the federal election in September , effectively distributing Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democratic Council ) from the Bundestag .	-6.3119
There have always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-2.6406
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.2297
Many people believe that the European project has gone too far because of the severe austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in conjunction with the straitjacket in which the national economy is forced by holding the single currency .	-5.7649
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-1.6495
Instead , the Eurosystem has established its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is something that German politicians would like to do .	-3.9700
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself with a built-in productivity disadvantage compared to Germany .	-5.1153
The only way is to reduce wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.0821
A deeper European productivity problem lies behind the current budget and monetary problems .	-2.4884
As a result of the ‘ green ’ energy policies imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times gas compared to the United States .	-4.2929
This is a ridiculous cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-4.2772
All world wage restrictions do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-3.7366
As a result , a revolt is occurring , especially in France , the EU ’ s one-time cheerleader .	-3.4897
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and bring Paris on a par with Washington .	-3.3253
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe to its own economic policy , which has to confront the French economy that has been hit .	-5.9777
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive re-election , citing the governing socialists in place three .	-4.8957
The National Front is now France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of the vote for voters – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot expect a split in the right spectrum would automatically bring benefits to the left .	-5.6473
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French of the working class ?	-2.4711
It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency block in the European Parliament .	-2.9937
If anti-EU parties were to circumvent – and this is a good way – then for the first time such a block could dominate the European Parliament .	-5.3657
That is the point I want to make : in the not-too-distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-4.1101
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something more like the “ Europe of ” ( sovereign ) nations that the General de Gaulle famously favored .	-3.4483
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.0792
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering itself in the United States .	-3.8719
However , Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone will be in the Atlantic rain .	-2.8947
Where does Scotland remain with all of this ?	-2.1913
We can decide to be a region of ( at the last consequence ) small England .	-3.3051
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including saying to Berlin and Brussels what they can hide .	-3.8709
I suspect Scotland could go very well in a more relaxed European union if we keep our own currency .	-4.4864
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.4869
Otherwise , we should consider equating Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-5.8431
The SNP government in Scotland , remarkable , is the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and incited ) cuts that the Labour Labour Minister , Alistair Darling , and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition .	-6.1721
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only to have austerity imposed on Berlin and Brussels .	-3.6203
Sooner Puberty : Faster Growing	-5.0786
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age coats , as shown by studies .	-4.4924
Poor changes do not directly imply puberty .	-3.5977
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.3204
Experts believe that epidemical obesity is a trigger of early puberty .	-2.6838
The early puberty trend is less pronounced among boys .	-3.4437
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridance is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-8.2215
Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grows breasts and shamhair at the age of seven or eight years ?	-3.6295
At the annual conference of the Children ’ s Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kapplovitz stated that these early physical changes were fairly normal among American girls and were a new standard .	-5.1484
“ I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually that ’ s no sign that the puberty is now fast entering , ” explains Kaplowitz .	-5.9808
Significant ads of development , such as growing breasts , sham and axle hairs , and body hose , are shown in girls earlier .	-6.9909
However , there has been only a slight shift in the age of the mentary ( presence of first rules blood ) over the last 40 years .	-6.1423
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.9038
“ When the development of the breast begins , it takes at least two to three years to the menarche , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early Purity of Girls : The essential funder to deal with this frequently encountered problem . ”	-6.6187
Time is the most precise test of how puberty is progressing .	-2.3328
It is controversial , which is indeed the beginning of puberty , but “ early ” is the case if the breast increase is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-5.7314
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a child ’ s doctor can closely monitor .	-3.5905
When advances are made more quickly , tests could be shown by an endian scientist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded .	-6.0747
There are treatment methods of delayed early menstruation and defense of another consequence : the premature ageing of the bones , which can lead the ultimate to growth inhibition and thus small body growth in adults .	-7.5970
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and the emotional maturity .	-3.7906
Psycho-social aspects are also important .	-1.4996
Kapplovitz is reluctant for medicines , but he admits : “ The oppression of purity can alleviate behavioural problems and girls ’ feelings of being different from their age motives . . ”	-6.1816
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.5976
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side , ” Kaplowitz said .	-3.7534
“ It was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter was ten her days .	-3.5795
Although there were initial signs and we spoke about menstruation , it was emotionally unprepared .	-2.8811
She was frightened and excited from school home because she was the first in her friend ’ s . . the were . . the were and .	-6.8304
There are many fully published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.6864
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be irrelevant .	-3.3790
boys come into puberty just like girls .	-4.1977
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.9554
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 over girls aged six to nine years , which creates a link between body fat and the admission to puberty .	-5.8490
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-1.6664
In this country African-American and Hispanic girls tend to achieve puberty rather than their white age coats .	-4.2387
There are different explanations for this .	-1.1984
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to the climate to the genes .	-6.7591
Another puberty : Although young boys are already growing face and shame earlier , the trend toward a full-fledged earlier puberty is not as strong as girls .	-5.1156
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-1.4922
The appearance of acne and shamhair is spreading even among babies and young children .	-3.4837
“ We must be careful how to identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-7.6049
Parents should not hesitate to consult their paediatrician as they should speak to their children .	-3.3497
“ This may mean that you have to hold a call earlier than expected ” , says Kaplowitz .	-5.2556
If you remain calm , the child normally responds well .	-2.5866
Girls that flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it first acts as intended .	-4.2788
Jumbo manufacturers argue for large orders over seat width .	-2.6362
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a debate on the width of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , which suggests the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.5549
The dispute revolves around the size of seats offered for long flights in the tourist class – not always those that make the most of airlines , but this shown space is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co aircraft .	-6.8055
Airbus called for a industry standard this week , which prescribes a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-4.8104
The debate comes at a time when the aircraft builders are betting to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-range aircraft , and record orders are expected at the event of November 17 to 21 .	-6.4990
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – in particular , if there are nine or ten seats – is crucial for the given economic results that the new mini jumbo design is to provide .	-5.6222
Boeing claims that its modernised “ 77X ” comprises 406 people in the tourist class , which are more than 17 inches wide and allows ten per row .	-6.7480
Airbus declares that the competing version of the A350 will carry 350 people in 18 Customs widths in the tourist class , with nine per line .	-10.4027
aircraft giants often share hiebe with technical details via advertising in the specialized press .	-5.0222
Airbus is now calling on the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X will be racing with more than 100 orders , directly to the public .	-4.5934
Recently , the company issued an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new display war , and that donators showed an image in which three people were sitting together in a restaurant , entitled : “ Would you accept it ? ”	-7.9038
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are more tighter than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus Sales Chief John Leahy .	-4.3272
With dietary habits changed , people become denser , but airplane seats have not changed radically .	-4.3308
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-distance journeys , and the end of the century , average male American weight increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to the US Department of Health .	-5.0846
According to American health statistics , the volume of the male average American in the twenty-first century is 100.8 cm .	-3.4283
Airbus says that its rivalry holds a seat from the 1950s , when the average body size of the freshly-launched Jet Set was smaller .	-5.8929
According to Airbus , studies have been carried out that an additional duty ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases the sleep quality by 53 % .	-4.7709
Boeing disagrees with Airbus figures and says that it is not up to manufacturers to decide how airlines will balance air tariffs and equipment .	-6.5180
The company also explains that , according to research , the flight experience depends on more than the seat width .	-3.9004
“ There is a real need for airlines to be flexible so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains the airline expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-4.7418
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.3451
They know their business better than any other .	-1.9836
Passengers are talking about more elbow free , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-5.4679
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated $ 700 billion worth of list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-4.3207
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the battle for the new jets .	-3.6333
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.2047
The statements Boeing on the results are partly due to the comparison of the 777X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-4.8417
Increased costs per unit are still lower than those currently used with ten seats per line .	-3.0029
“ Boeing therefore quests more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-4.0396
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row at 7777s indicate that many passengers have chosen the narrower order , which could be accompanied by cheaper flight tariffs .	-6.6714
“ Achtehn Zolls seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is driven from the threat of 777 , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin equipment , founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network .	-6.5877
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-3.4839
The world ’ s traveller Jet sellers even wear tape to measure the performance of the competition .	-7.4343
Even if they award comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with high density for cheap airlines and regional flights .	-5.6453
Airbus has a ten-seated A350 , but has not sold its own statement .	-4.5919
Until recently , Airbus has stressed the importance of more customization of the cabins and offered wide seats for a number of jets .	-4.6940
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard would probably be poised , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-5.0591
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make smoking fun .	-2.7447
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could destroy the fun of smoking .	-1.7892
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine for a lifetime .	-3.2827
Before human tests , further tests are needed , which may take some years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-3.7941
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers that have tried to stop and have tested all the methods available on the market , but experience has had to make their nicotine stronger than those approaches , ” says Cornell .	-5.5021
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been modified to contain genetic information about the production of nicotine antibodies .	-3.3887
The virus selectively infected the liver cells , which then produce a permanent flow of antibodies .	-3.3481
Antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving a smoker not nicotine high .	-3.5048
In temples , vaccinated mice that Nikotin was administered gave her normal level of activity .	-5.1999
By contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ expiration , ” the researchers explained , a sign that Nikotin had reached her brain .	-6.0552
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-1.6770
Previously , tobacco implants failed because they contained antibodies .	-3.4927
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.8900
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably considerably lower , because it transforms liver cells into anti-body plants .	-3.5853
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is quite certain , could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine disease .	-5.5287
More likely , however , is that smokers would use him to stop .	-1.9028
“ You know , when they start to smoke again , they no longer feel a pleasure because of the niotine vaccine , and that helps them to cast the habit , ” he explains .	-6.5949
British scientists said that the results were interesting but , at the same time , warned that more research is needed .	-9.4215
Tripodi claims to be influenced by Obeid	-2.4531
The former Labour Minister , Joe Tripodi , from New South Wales , has been investigating the state ’ s supervision of corruption .	-5.6347
The former NSW minister is pledging to have changed the arrangements for maritime displacement at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had covert holdings in three areas of government control .	-7.6827
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into the question of whether Obeid had influenced several ministers of state in such a way as to have pactional contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe , without expanding their expiration in August 2005 .	-9.6152
Tripodi has now been identified because of the accusation that Obeids has known a hidden interest in the land after Tripodis had issued former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday .	-6.5480
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public invitations to tender for the couples .	-4.7606
The handlers were against this and wanted longer term runs .	-5.6970
In 2009 , the lease contracts for Circular Quay companies that launched the Obeids a $ 2.5 million annually were extended without public tender .	-11.0975
Tripodi , a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , initially advocated public tenders .	-3.7608
But he discontinued having made the changes to Obeid ’ s requests , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for the government ’ s transfer of payment arrangements .	-7.2672
One of the ICAC 's proposed telephone lines showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior officer who changed to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-5.1186
“ Was the issue raised in these phone calls for the elaboration of the commercial assault rules ? ” , the deputy Commissioner , Anthony Whealy Tripodi , asked .	-6.4133
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.7194
I cannot recall what was discussed , but that was definitely not the case .	-6.8332
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.3773
Israeli combat aircraft are targeting Syria , as official sources .	-2.9513
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked Thursday ’ s Syrian port Lataki , a senior government official confirmed against Fox News .	-11.3300
The official did not explain what the aim was , but said that it was at least one .	-2.3790
According to Associated Press , the goal was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-2.5232
At least twice , Israel has already carried out airstrikes on Syria ’ s missile supplies this year .	-2.5573
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ confidence tests . ”	-3.7865
The government is considering a 457 visa for foreign workers in the framework of enhanced measures .	-6.5580
If the test is introduced , it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 being used for the occupation of unqualified jobs or as a back door for the admission of family and friends to Australia .	-5.0924
Today , a government discussion proposal was published after the former Labour MEPs , Maxime McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be described as insult by Australia ’ s neighbours .	-6.4296
“ The volume of statements such as that foreigners should stop , ” and , firstly , Australians are a very unpleasant fall in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she said to Australia India Institute today .	-7.8120
Historically , it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region associate a echo of this historical artifact , that would not surprise me .	-4.8501
The proposal for a discussion covers twelve measures , which were once considered by former Minister for Immigration , Chris Bowen .	-4.7690
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who visited Sri Lanka yesterday , spoke about human smuggling , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and others will be considered .	-4.9842
If the “ criterion of authenticity ” is adopted , then someone who requests a visa could be checked to see whether “ the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-6.5505
Companies could also be required to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers finally abandoned hundreds .	-4.8164
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylant probably died from a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island .	-5.4519
The late nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia has been served by a adult cousin since his father 's death on Wednesday .	-5.2381
Australia 's authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-2.0138
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-3.3148
In the work of HS2 Ltd , it is proposed to establish high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England at the start of phase 1 in 2026 .	-4.9287
Minister of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-7.2793
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown explained that he is very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.8673
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed connection between London and the West Midlands .	-1.8331
After conclusion of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.2286
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building high-speed road between London and North England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-2.9256
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further route capacity and improved travel times for North England and Scotland .	-5.4212
This includes the possibility of a travel time from the end of the day , or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-5.4955
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.6514
We are making progress with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.4967
Without it , we face a crisis of capacity on our rail network .	-2.9592
But it is also a question of connecting 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which will be improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.9856
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today 's announcement is a good news for Scotland . ”	-3.3592
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichel called for “ unequivocal ” for Scottish involvement in the HS2 network .	-3.7162
Brown said : “ The high-speed link brings with it the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland , while also providing Scotland ’ s economic power an argument for fast rail connections across the UK . ”	-4.4819
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and complements Glasgow-Edinburgh , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-6.1389
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to decide on the next steps together .	-4.4171
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft are provisionally in Australia .	-2.0102
Australian air passengers must also continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease the regime for such devices .	-5.6555
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their targets so that passengers can read , watch , or play on their devices during critical flight phases of e-books , if they are in “ flight mode . ”	-5.0258
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when they start and landing .	-4.1944
Australia ’ s societies observe the decision to implement which US airlines must do little work , but do not pursue any immediate plans to amend their rules .	-11.3331
The CASA also stated that the announcement will be viewed , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia remain in force .	-5.4761
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” has been verified .	-4.5496
The subject is subject to provisions whereby airlines must maintain safety at any time and passengers must comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin crew .	-4.2398
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA on expanding its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and declared that one is open to change , but that should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.7026
“ We would welcome a review of the admission of electronic devices by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” a speaker said .	-5.5162
Qantas explained that we will continue to apply the current rules .	-3.8893
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic equipment should not be used on startup and landing , and we do not currently have any plans to change that , ” the company explained .	-4.9430
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.2877
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that allow passengers to benefit , and I am sure we will look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-5.1079
The decision varies depending on the age of the fleet of US companies .	-3.9019
They need to prove that their aircraft can tolerate the funk killings of mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer documentation .	-10.4716
“ After an airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lighter electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-5.0047
In rare cases in poor visibility , passengers will instruct while landing off their devices .	-5.3991
The group also recommended that heavier appliances be stolen safely under the seat or the subjects above the seats .	-4.4083
In front of the Readderby against Schalke , there were regular BVB trailers with beacons for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-6.0999
Borussia Dortmund subsequently announced some tough consequences .	-1.6390
Before the Friday game of the soccer League against VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras responded with a silence - first of all .	-4.5332
It was an unfamiliar , almost already spoken , acoustic , which offered itself to the viewer until just before the arrival of the Bundesliga pile between German vice-champion Borussia Dortmund and VfB Stuttgart in the Iduna Park .	-7.1351
The people were mostly listening to their singing .	-3.9048
In contrast , the Southern Tribune , where the most loyal and loudest BVB fans stand , first presented itself with extraordinary quietness : no songs , no battles .	-7.2293
The stands of the cap , which otherwise coordinates the joint firing , remained unchanged .	-3.7891
And in front of the gallery there was a big flag titled " Action Stadium " .	-7.6203
Only when Torhhüter Roman Weidenfeller , as always as the first BVB player , set up short-time jewellery .	-5.6244
When his team colleagues followed , there were loudest vocals and awesome chels - but not everywhere .	-4.8760
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the south tribe .	-3.5901
Also that stadium sliders Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of recent days - Derbysig , victory over Arsenal , contract extension of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration .	-5.6803
Only five minutes before the arrival , the Capo knocked his podium - and until then this straight away with hands of tangible allusion came out in a loud crie when , as usual , Dickel asked the mood on the slopes in the stadium .	-10.5519
The last one was the southern tribunal , as always - and finally the loudest place was once again in the stadium .	-6.6969
And when the bidding " Derbysieger stands on " with the arrival of the southern tribe , everything was as always .	-8.8941
The silence had probably been a response to what happened in recent days .	-3.8219
Immediately in front of Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the followers of the BVB had beacons in the listeners and fired on the square - and almost Torhüter Roman Weidefeller met .	-9.0325
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes .	-0.9920
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had subsequently received the top of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believed Watzkes 's words , this was a rather irreparable appointment for the fan representatives .	-6.1978
" There will be massive cuts for the entire Ultra-Movement " , the BVB Boss announced on Thursday at a podium discussion in Frankfurt .	-9.0591
As an immediate measure , Watzke banned Ultras from playing home against VfB Stuttgart .	-3.3369
" I banned it , " he explained .	-2.4808
We cannot give up zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.3348
Furthermore , the Ultras have shown a number of ways of punishing them - until Tuesday they have time to make a decision .	-5.9435
Otherwise , Watzke , the BVB will decide a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.6123
" This is drastically " , insured Waterke .	-9.2250
We must be curious about the reactions in the Southern Tribunal .	-5.5757
Pfandhouses Booming in Singapore , as the crisis in the middle class has arrived .	-3.7661

Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is so large that ValueMax , where she made her exchange , became the third Pfandhaus listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-4.4158
The pledge of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1.300 in the case of Janani Amirthalgia – but also almost as cheap as an unchecked bank loan .	-5.0570
Typically , Pfandhouses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest of 17 % , which is just over 15.4 % , which the United Overseas Bank requires , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping center .	-5.2094
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that there is no need for a credit or income check , which is why loans are faster than banks can .	-4.8844
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhouses after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-4.5454
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit , owing to a loose fiscal policy in the developed economies , are seeking families with lower and middle-income income pathways to offset the difference in low-income economies .	-6.5713

According to the Agency , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , the highest household debt in Asia relative to the gross domestic product is estimated .	-3.8032
Malaysia represents 80 % of GDP at the top of the list , an increase of 60 % even in 2008 .	-8.9359

The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator , EasyMoney , has seen a 20-percent growth in its branches in recent months .	-3.8309
Growth in the Pfandbusiness is so strong that ValueMax , the provider of branches in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only in neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , so Yeah Lee Ching , CEO of ValueMax .	-5.1094
The company is funding this with 60 % of the $ 66 million that it received in Singapore this week .	-4.0518
While some lenders have fallen into the crusade for high interest rates , Yeah says that Pfandhouses have not only lowered interest rates other than other losers , but also did not directly increase debt .	-6.6431
“ Clients inflict items that they already own , and inflicting personal values does not increase household debt , ” explains them .	-4.8180
The Pfandleiheim business is increasingly widely accepted as short-term , secured funding .	-4.1411
Nor are all the people who use Pfandleihe in financial difficulties .	-3.4433
The rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax 's stores to maintain gold bars and rosemary clocks , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-7.0818
Customers from any social class come to us .	-3.1499
“ These include the wealthy who borrow in the short term for a business or investment , or small businesses that have to bridge cash-flow bottlenecks , ” Yeah says .	-4.3798

Following the presentation of the founding member of the German parliament , Hans-Christian Ströbele , his surprise meeting with Snowden in Russia was about the conditions under which ex-secret service workers would issue a German prosecutor or a committee of inquiry .	-7.4106

Saving a package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman Health .	-4.0803
The Australian Government is insisting on the tough conditions associated with the rescue package for more than 325 million Australian dollars for the Tasman health service to ensure that the government of the state cannot afford to waste money .	-6.3886
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersec has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-4.5925
The funding for a period of four years was decided by government consultations with independent Tasman Andrew Wilkie .	-3.7212
“ The government has created an emergency rescue package that we believe to be concerned with the unique challenges that the state faces , ” Plibersec now said .	-5.8433
The $ 325-million-dollar package includes $ 31 million in direct payments .	-4.4659
Further 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments for gray Star , are designed to eliminate the residues .	-4.3263
In addition , there is money for day-clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better care for statistical stays , specialized exchanges , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording health data in local hospitals .	-5.7329
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that hospital staff concerned have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersec .	-4.4474
The minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman Government .	-2.5498
The state must maintain the current level of funding to get money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent .	-4.6895
A three-headed Commission will be set up and will ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.3298
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that would bring the public Tasman health system to a more sustainable course . ”	-5.0577
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .	-3.9704
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to the preservation of the care list of state public health systems , ” said Wilkie .	-3.9820
According to the federal government , these electoral services will largely offset the recent cuts .	-3.2155
But the federal government ’ s health-policy spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ poultry solution . ”	-4.1841
“ We are in a position today because the Labor Government has dragged $ 430 million out of the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-10.8632
It is unacceptable for a state government to leave almost half a billion dollars out of the system and to involve the Commonwealth 300 million , and then to do so as to be good news .	-5.6859
Dutton called on Plibersec to guarantee that not a single dollar of the bailout will be spent on extra bureaucracy .	-3.0542

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such as a monitoring group .	-3.6358
Syria destroyed important chemical weapons and grease munitions facilities , the global chemical weapons monitoring group declared on Thursday , while severe clashes in the north of the country were close to one of the sites where suspected substances are stored .	-6.5637
Also on Thursday , a symmetrical force announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed nearly three years ago since the civil war began .	-4.6375
The announcement of the Organization for the Banning of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came a day before the date of the meeting .	-4.3866
November 1 , which had set Damascus , based in The Hague , in order to destroy or “ inoperably ” all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons , including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling munitions .	-6.6929
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria 's chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-4.2368
Destroying institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.1802
Damascus , however , must begin to destroy the existing weapons and stocks .	-3.0361
According to the estimates , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including channels and nerve gas Sarin .	-4.8998
The announcement came at a time when , on Thursday , battles took place in the city of Safira , experts said that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses as the Syrian Monitoring Centre for Human Rights heard in the United Kingdom .	-5.4920
The group of activists who are following the number of deaths in Syria via a network of activists declared on Thursday that 120.296 people had died .	-4.7991
These include 61.067 civilians , including 6,365 children .	-1.5715
On the government side , 2954 of them were owned by President Bashar Assad ’ s army , 18.678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-5.0791
Also among the dead were 2.202 desolated army data and 5.375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.9745
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-1.8982
This number has not been updated .	-1.2399
The conflict has forced two million people to flee from the country .	-10.3898
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels , many of which have connections to al-Qaida groups .	-3.0328
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday but no details .	-2.2981
The struggles underscore the danger posed by chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its poisonous arms arsenal is a race against time in the middle of a dreadful civil war .	-5.1703
According to the OPCW , which is working closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and experienced all the important production and compilation facilities mentioned by Syria , and its destruction . ”	-6.0225
So , “ no more inspection activities are planned . ”	-3.0542
Earlier this week , the inspectors stated that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites mentioned by Damascus .	-3.9314
Because of safety , two institutions were not allowed to visit , the inspectors said .	-3.4520
On Thursday , the OPC said that the two sites had been dismissed according to Syrian statements ... and the chemical weapons programme objects there had been relocated to other above-mentioned facilities . ”	-7.7858
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit the OPCW inspectors .	-3.5000
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month .	-3.1956
“ I prefer the courage and courage that you have all shown in completing the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the monitoring organization , in a commentary published by OPCW .	-6.2590

In view of further developments , the Director of the Observatory , Rami Abdurrahman , said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-5.1126
The cause of the explosion was not known , he explained .	-2.8566
Zorn ’ s judgment on Bali ’ s .	-3.3646
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 were angry at the judgment of the last of the Implementer who was brought to court , because Umar Patek , in her view , was to be shot by the law .	-10.1217
Patek , who was in flight almost ten years ago as one of the most popular people in Southeast Asia , was sentenced yesterday to imprisonment for his role in building jumps for the bombing of 20 years .	-6.6402
He could be dismissed after 15 years of punitive .	-3.7715
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder for the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many more were injured .	-3.2273
A school league also took place in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on sanctuary in 2000 .	-5.3485
The prosecutor had asked for a lifetime sentence , even if she could have applied the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bombing farmer , could have been called a “ demotion man . ”	-6.9858
The decision has aroused painful memories at June Corteen , a mother of Perth , who lost her 39 years old twins , Jane and Jenny , in the devastation caused by Patek and his conspiracy almost ten years ago .	-4.8259
She said with tears fighting that patek should have been sentenced to death .	-3.4769
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guns .	-1.8714
“ You should put it before a firing command , ” Corteen said .	-4.3782
I have to live every day by getting no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .	-3.3300

Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds before a suicide bomber wanted to expose a backpack filled with explosive fuel .	-5.0215
He died three times after the attack in the Coma and “ died ” three times during a life preservation system .	-4.4238
Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-3.5581
In fact , this type should receive the death penalty from all the others .	-9.3508
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to leave him alive .	-2.5691
20 years after killing people in 202 and hurting many hundreds , is not much .	-3.5592
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber to be brought to justice .	-2.5947
He took off almost a decade of arrest , but eventually came up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed Osama bin Laden almost four months later .	-5.7132
During the negotiations , a FBI agent said that intelligence reports had made the point that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-4.5375
“ He did not make himself , ” Corteen said .	-3.3467
Until recently , he has shown no respect for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-2.6498
The judgment preceded the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is celebrated with commemorations in Bali and Australia .	-3.5078
“ There will be many tears this year , ” Corteen said .	-1.5946
Patek can appeal against his judgment .	-3.0878
FAA : passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not have mobile telephone calls )	-2.8157
From departure to landing , passengers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , music and viewing movies , but not phone calls , so the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-5.9030
However , passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.8748
As soon as they were implemented , FAA employees Michael Huerta announced at a press conference .	-3.7211
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline staff and the rules for inventing equipment according to the new rules .	-6.4128
The FAA has said that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.9054
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .	-1.5906
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic equipment , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-5.1724
At present , passengers need to turn off smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-4.1058
You may only restart them until the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-5.0368
When entering the landing flight , passengers must stop them again and not restart them before the aircraft is caught .	-5.9059
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are safe against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use equipment at startup , landing and rollboard , the FAA explained .	-6.0245
Most new airplanes and other planes that have been upgraded to larger levels for use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-5.7451
Laura Glading , President of the professional airline 's association , welcomed the changes .	-3.1684
“ If the new arrangement is certainly implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented gladings .	-5.0719
We are frankly sorry to have to feel like passers-by on this issue .	-4.2242
Nevertheless , Internet connections remained prohibited to surfing , exchange e-mails , text messages , or download data under three kilometres , the Authority explained .	-5.5995
Passengers are asked to put smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .	-3.2843
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble similar online game played by actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone when he had to leave a jet of American airlines effectively because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was parked on the plane .	-6.4930
And heavier devices such as laptops must also continue to fail , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-5.3479
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also still prohibited .	-4.0283
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-2.1579
FAA may ban certain electronic devices on startup and landing .	-2.4883
Last month , Mark Rosenker said that the National Transportation Safety Board , safety experts on national transport issues at CBS News , mobile phones would still be viewed as a risk .	-5.2855
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could cause potentially disruptions to navigational devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transfer from the air can also disrupt Sendemasten , ” says Rosenker .	-6.8449
A industry advisory committee set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government permit a wider use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.3513
In recent years pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-2.3919
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill of Missouri argue that there are no valid security grounds for the ban .	-3.8691
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the devices has become pervasive .	-4.4163
In some studies , there is talk that up to one third of passengers forget or ignore the removal of the device .	-6.1201
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disruptions of navigational and communication equipment had become known by passenger UKW-radios , which were then the latest technology trend .	-7.0702
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed in such a way and approved by the FAA that they do not understand electronic interferences .	-4.9091
For some years now , airlines have been able to offer Wi-Fi when the flight is reached .	-5.4137
The planes adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more unsensitive to interference .	-5.2585
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives , Huerta said .	-3.6561
Today ’ s electronic devices generally give far less radio streaming than previous generations .	-3.5639
E-Reader , for example , emits minimal radiation when blowing .	-3.7627
But when downloading or sending data , transmission values are stronger .	-3.2146
Among the advocates of relaxation of passenger cabin use by Amazon.com.	-4.8914
In 2011 , the company staff invited a passenger airliner full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find . . .	-11.6351
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.1153
Douglas Kidd , a member of the National Association of Airline Passengers , said that he believes that the disruption by the equipment is true , even if the risk is minimal .	-4.9079
Other committee members have said that there are only single reports from pilots who are in charge of disruption of aircraft systems by equipment , and most of them are very old .	-5.5060
The FAA committee recommended , however , that it should allow pilots to place the passenger off in case of instrument landing in poor visibility .	-7.4939
A group of travellers from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adaptation for travellers , who are now largely equipped with technology .	-6.1785
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not in conflict with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-3.7239
Reverse bird saved from the North Sea vessel from the air rescue service .	-6.4789
A bird flown by air rescue service on the coast , who had been exhausted on a North Sea vessel , has once again been released into nature .	-6.9123
The Water Ralls was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter , where it was repaid by the SPCA Scottish Animal Protection Organization in their rescue center in Alloa .	-6.5372
Colin Seddon , Head of the Centre , said : “ This water rally was probably a winter voyage from Northern Europe , which was stopped by the strong winds above the North Sea . ”	-5.7674
The exhausted bird sought refuge on the drill island .	-4.5251
He added : “ He could no longer fly and we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.5642
During their release , the water rally was back fit and healthy .	-4.3685
Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-1.5849
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to the table and define what those in the UK want to change prosperity and work in our relations with the EU .	-3.8381
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-3.2410
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 economics managers , which are training in about British company sizes , sectors and regions .	-5.8544
The results of the poll will surprise many .	-1.7519
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe and focused on countries that modernise and grow while the countries in the EU are stagnant .	-4.7808
They want new trade connections to countries such as China , India , and Brazil to be favored by government , rather than keeping up with the long and demanding process of reforming the EU ’ s obscure institutions .	-5.0882
In their view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be returned to Westminster , from cartels right to product legislation .	-5.3332
There was general discontent about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of big companies agreed to that which are traditionally the most pro-European .	-5.9715
Finally , and this is probably the most important thing to say , our survey of business leaders revealed that a clear majority of the UK wants a course of change to the agreement and does not want a relationship with the EU based on trade .	-6.8192
This insight , found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the rise of action back to Britain .	-5.6778
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change of opinion in favour of EU bonding in a referendum at 16 % .	-5.0383
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership .	-2.5572
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of power relations back to the UK .	-2.9326
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving toward a closer economic and fiscal union .	-3.3690
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our poll shows , which means greater focus on trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.8679
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the start of a new gas era .	-3.2237
The beginning of the South-Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects , explained by the Gazprom Board .	-3.7399
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction works on the Bulgarian part of the South-Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO , Alexei Miller , on Thursday in a statement .	-4.5936
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire continent of Europe .	-2.3861
South Stream is to ensure more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.3487
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , in which most of the Russian gas is stored for Europe , takes care of an increased risk of conventional routes , as the official side has to say .	-5.9162
Miller said that direct links to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , mean that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “ outdated forever . ”	-3.4704
Bulgarian consumers get gas from South Stream to cheaper rates when the entire project enters into operation in 2015 .	-3.4444
According to Gazprom , construction work is to begin in other subsequent countries on the planned route to the end of the year .	-3.8338
The pipeline has an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic meters of natural gas .	-2.2607

Debate to the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused of charges against Jonathan Lord for sex offences .	-4.0257
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been prosecuted for sex offences linked to children before allegations were made in 2011 against the child carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children .	-5.5889
But , in the opening statement to the Commission , the YMCA stated that “ the organization never had an incident of sexual abuse . ”	-4.8800
Phillip Hare was interviewed on a case where a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher at the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been sentenced to him for the misuse of children .	-7.8627
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the assisting lawyers in the Commission , that he knew of the first case , the second but not looking forward .	-4.8392
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the assertion that “ there have been external review of the YMCA , in which the YMCA was recognised as the first front of children ’ s safety . ”	-6.1562
On the contrary , evidence from the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-4.1624
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the management failed “ from me to downward ” in the recruitment of Lord , and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety directives .	-6.6795
Lord had been sentenced to twelve boys at the beginning of the year because of sex offences during his two year work for the YMCA .	-4.4827
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.5679
But Hare argues that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented staff from reporting Lords ’ breaches of child safety .	-6.1746
The employees said that they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , took care of them privately as a baby sitter , sitting on his lap , told them that he was happy to play children with his mobile .	-7.8481
Danielle Ockwell , the chief executive of which was Lord and who asked for a training to protect children because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the nursery , Jacqui Barnat , who was the chief executive of Lords in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and the most vulnerable time . ”	-8.2979
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to reimburse their supervisor .	-5.7770
Instead , he said , her friendship with Lord had impaired her judgment , which is why she would not have reported .	-6.3855
Hare explained that he told the Executive Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “ Jonathan Lord incident , ” “ not the Melden ” by employees , and the Board agreed to it .	-5.8341
Hare said that the decision to force employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the charges were issued was taken by the Managing Director of YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-4.8412
He said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence , but that was ‘ exaggerated ’ and badly implemented .	-3.6826
YMCA NSW , when Jonathan Lord was busy there between 2009 and 2011 , had not been a safe organization for children , Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert on sexual child abuse , told the Commission .	-4.2587
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , review , processing , training and supervision of staff .	-4.0886

In an interview this evening , on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his leaving office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.2241
Since its resignation in June 2007 , after a decade of head of state , Blair has largely avoided expressing its views on British politics , and his comments are mostly limited to foreign policy and its role as envoy of the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers .	-6.0433
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted in the words of Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this happens , that is , ... ”	-5.4263
When the Cardiff horse experts entered into Sharen in Cardiff to rally the horse of the year , they knew that a tough competitive battle was imminent .	-6.6223
No one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.4093
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten , and took his first steps only a few months ago , and his Shetland Pony toffee loosely travelled through the three rounds and won the first prize – with 30 adult opponents left behind .	-8.5229
The uninterrupted couple , both large , were laughed at the annual competition held by the Sunybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff because of their presence , behavior and style .	-5.4834
During his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had raised his leghold cap in a cute corner and led the two years of old death by the ring .	-6.6437
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the Pony , who were far above his age .	-4.0486
And raffle received best notes for his appearance and personality .	-2.3622
Toffee was given a gift last March for his third birthday and has had to deal with the Shetland Pony every day .	-6.1917
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great messenger . ”	-3.3967
They had to compete against the entire participant field and took place with Goldpokal and Rosette .	-5.5064
It was only the second time he had participated in a competition with baffees , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.7644
Fully stranded outside the arena considered him so great that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-4.4886
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his Tante Sharon Howell , who has held horses for over ten years .	-4.8706
Howler told : “ The entire audience was as electrified and everyone fired and glued it . ”	-6.0543
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he was so winty he did fantastic work .	-4.6644
Fenton is crazy to animals – he loves horses , tractors and farm farms and has two chickens to take care of them .	-3.8065
As he has started , it will not take long for him to be on the “ Horse of the Year ” -chau – and I am sure he will finish well .	-4.3477
A spokesman of the annual horse chaos said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.4045
Together they are a great team .	-1.1351
Fenton and the raffle judged how well they had beaten and presented in the race ring .	-5.1379
They care about good cooperation between Pony and Leader – and Fenton and Tolee were the best in the ring .	-4.3446
I am sure that Fentons ’ sweet clothing has contributed its part , which really fits perfectly to occasion .	-4.4535
China ’ s newspaper is supposed to be “ reformed ” after call .	-12.1450
A Chinese newspaper on the front page called for a reporter ’ s release , accused of defamation , to be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-4.5588
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-3.0098
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a partial company .	-4.0218
Now the New Express is being subtracted to a “ comprehensive survey , ” the Regulatory Authority declared .	-4.9526
The ‘ record order ’ came from the Press and Publications Authority , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-4.3792
Preliminary investigations revealed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , published several inaccurate reports of the publicly traded Zomlion company between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-4.4375
“ The management of the New Express was disorderly , ” the Regulatory Authority announced in a statement .	-4.1415
She said that it was decided “ to impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and remove his reporter licence . ”	-4.3016
Moreover , “ Yangcheng Evening News Group has been asked to make a complete review of the New Express and recommend that the relevant leaders be notified at the New Express and check the New Express leadership team immediately . ”	-7.2504
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zomlion .	-5.2009
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for its release on the front page and directed behind his journalistic work .	-3.1308
But then Chen resigned to state television and admitted that he had published false reports for payment .	-4.9950
“ In this case , I damaged zoomlion as well as the entire news market and its ability to win public confidence , ” he explained to the state news company CCTV .	-5.3230
I did it primarily because I was on money and fame .	-2.4277
I have realised that I was wrong .	-3.0319
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page , saying that it failed to check the reports correctly .	-3.8053
Several well-known suspects have recently passed TV suspects .	-3.5323
Experts say that concessions are still routinely imposed , despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities have been banned from forcing anyone to accuse themselves .	-4.3602
Discover drugs tunnel with its own railways between the US and Mexico .	-4.2163
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electric rail operations , has now been discovered .	-4.0940
The US authorities described the 12,90 centimetre tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages ever found .	-3.5967
The tunnel , which runs in the Zickzackmuster over a length of just six football fields , connects storehalls near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-4.4053
In the area there are countless unimaginable storehouses , making it easier to hide lorries containing drugs .	-5.0920
The tunnel was closed before the drugs could not be used to transport it , the authorities said . the were . . the were and . . the were . . .	-10.5720
During the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , such as the Court ’ s records .	-4.9115
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged because of the acquis and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .	-3.8843
They are threatened with imprisonment for ten years and for life .	-3.4009
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of waste water canals .	-2.9821
The tunnel is the eighth major passage discovered since 2006 in San Diego .	-2.1032
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October following the Marijuana harvest in Central Mexico , which poses the challenge of bringing their product to consumers quickly .	-5.1060
In 2010 , authorities found a 640 metre long passage with railways , ranging from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storeys in San Diego .	-5.4403
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love themselves .	-1.7075
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-1.5214
But Bloom said in an interview that he and Kerr still love themselves .	-2.5224
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year flynn .	-2.3606
Actress Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.9410
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was supposed to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not work as we plan or hope " .	-4.5049
Kerr and he loved himself still , stressed the 36-year-old man .	-3.6123
" We will support each other and love Flynn 's parents .	-2.2890
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , in 2011 their sleepless flynn was born .	-3.0414
The veganism , according to Lexika , is controlled by vegetarianism , but is very different from it .	-5.2530
For while vegetarians allow themselves to consume rhetoric , ice or a powerful Edamer , these worms are not on the menu of a vegan .	-4.6231
Milk , cheese , eggs , besides meat and fish , the vegan leaves from all ingredients of animal products - and honey is destroyed .	-6.1606
What remains is to be asked , but when we look closer , the vegan food world is characterised by a remarkable imagination .	-6.8315
" Brotaufstriche are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reformer house , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-5.1881
Reuben Proctor also visits the store in the Domgasse .	-3.5356
For 13 years the native New Zealand has lived vegan , in Lampertheim it finds ( almost ) everything he needs for life . " In 1997 I created my diet and became .	-7.3867
At the turn of the century , the next step was taken and I became a vegan .	-1.8899
" But the conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of shoe , " says Proctor , who prefers the artificial leather of normal .	-5.0013
He recognized that it is also in other everyday concerns without animal products .	-4.0923
Above all , vegan is an ethic .	-3.1648
" I don 't want animals to die for me " , Proctor talks about the maxim of vegans that extends to the whole consumption behaviour .	-4.3665
Instead of burgers , beers or rubbernurses , the vegan quickly discovered new products that increased enthusiasm .	-5.5808
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " in fact vegan is not a renunciation , it is an enrichment " .	-6.2719
And it is precisely these conditions that have led some still to fail well-meaning attempts .	-5.2869
" The search factor is a very decisive factor that lets many quickly drop out , similar to that of smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-6.5693
And applies to one : " Certain tastes are not to be found on the animal " .	-6.7163
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-2.9813
" You can generate the same effect in other ways , " the vegan clarifies .	-3.9608
Proctor brings , for example , Aubergins , Champagnes and a few vegans .	-6.8760
It pays attention to a balanced , diversified diet , which is intended to taste it quite defensively .	-5.4023
Of course , one wants to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-4.0098
" It is supposed to smile , but this is not just about animal food " , says Proctor .	-4.9322
He did not suffer from environmental damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption . . , however , he , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.5290
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.0860
I do not accept a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin content .	-3.8454
There are high performance athletes that only eat vegan .	-3.1501
" My blood values are excellent , I have often checked me , " says Proctor .	-4.7995
Many vegan critics warn , especially before the lack of vitamin B12 .	-3.5401
" Since animals are fed with fodder , rather than grass , it is questionable whether in the meat that you buy in the refrigerator , the Vitamin-12 percentage is high , " Proctor finds .	-6.6087
For Vegans it is also possible to take the coenzym in the form of tablets .	-3.2462
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.2133
Far ways Proctor should not go for food procurement .	-3.8220
The basic food products are finally available everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-4.7552
All I need is on the spot .	-2.8998
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-2.7229
" Many people overlook the fact that only manufacturing products are expensive , but as we know , " ordinary " manufacturing products are also " .	-11.5305
Too often the preparation of vegan dishes is far cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly thought .	-5.3361
" In the kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small knives you can achieve good , if not partially better results " , says Proctor .	-4.0160
Proctor was also able to bring his songwriters to the fire instead of butter , a little more baker and carbonic acid instead of egg .	-8.3840
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spike .	-3.3811
This is a new priority , if you talk together .	-4.8904
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves " Proctor says .	-3.5316
Of course , he has also been shown scepticism .	-4.2025
Are you tired of eating ?	-3.8461
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - if you have such questions , you have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips .	-5.8534
" I don 't deny people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want enclave periods .	-4.0523
And , to be precise , everyday life does not seem as vehemently as expected - and the vegan does not seem to be constrained in everyday life as commonly thought .	-7.5034
Fast Food is also allowed .	-1.5003
Pommes are everywhere !	-4.6654
" Many dancers offer Falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-4.0068
In a pizzeria he wears on pasta , or ordered a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .	-4.4103
The restaurants are so slow to cater for it .	-4.1718
" When I started feeding me a vegan , everything was even more difficult " , the New Zealand may find a development : " People must talk to people , draw attention to it " .	-6.8270
" If there are enough follow-up questions , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , " he hopes .	-3.8017
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the Mannheim Comfort and the Café Vogelfree .	-4.4763
Proctor would like other restaurants to have at least a vegan meal on the menu .	-4.2637
Basically , there are vegan courts for all .	-2.5721
Everyone can eat them , so they are the exact opposite of exclusive .	-2.5836
In contrast , " meat courts are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others " , Proctor decides .	-4.3102
" If you want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way of making the vast majority of the first impossible , " Proctor says .	-3.6598
However , purchasing vegan products can be difficult in the beginning .	-4.3125
In particular , if one learns to understand which animal additives as a color can also contain in the soil , it seems that the adherence of ethics to so many hurdles and traps quickly seems to be abandoned .	-8.5951
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganisimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients provided for food and cleaning products .	-5.0401
" After and after developing a scanning view and knowing which signs and logos you have to respect , " It is sometimes better to take small steps than to stay or to stoltle " , Proctor knows .	-7.3947
Veganism , he is an important moral fingerline that beats awareness .	-5.1120
Perhaps he does not manage to detract from his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to take a critical look at their habits .	-4.7553
The Exchange Operator Nasdaq OMX continues to maintain its customers breath .	-3.1509
The trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted at the German Friday afternoon .	-3.2215
In a communication the operator was responsible for technical problems .	-1.6626
The other 11 US options markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.2117
The most recent incident continues a series of smaller and larger panels in the stock exchange operator .	-2.9275
It was only on Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices had not been charged for an hour because of errors in the data transport .	-4.3005
In August of this year , there were two mishaps in the same week alone .	-5.4725
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent mass erroneous purchasing orders to the options markets for technical problems .	-4.4089
As a result , stock market operators needed almost a day to watch and delete orders .	-4.6195
Two days later , half of the total equity trade in the US stalled because of a computer panel on the Nasdaq exchange for several hours .	-5.6862
It was also evident last year from the Facebook stock exchange .	-4.8042
The Nasdaq systems were unable to cope with the flood of purchase and sale orders , later the SEC Stock Exchange Supervisory Board decided and gave the company a record penalty of $ 10 million .	-6.0181
Konstanz : Radler travels 63-year-olds .	-9.7007
The incident was followed by police , when a 26 year old man was on Thursday 's day , at 22 : 00 , with a voy 's wheel wandering illegally on the left hand from the Bahnhofplatz towards the market place .	-18.6433
When a 63 year old man stepped down from a locality , the bicycle driver could no longer put a brake on time according to the police .	-6.3951

British police issue Assange with a statement of extradition .	-3.8136
The British police today handed over a statement of extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian message in London and asked for asylum .	-4.2205
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year Australians were “ called upon to face up ” to call him to appear in a police station , and added that he did not attend to it , threatened him to arrest .	-8.1243
Assange is threatened with extradition to Sweden for charges in a sex offence , after exhausted its possibilities under British law , since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-5.3650
Because he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the US , he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-4.2389
Scotland Yard , “ a 40-year-old man , gave an invitation to join a police force at a time we selected , ” he said .	-6.7579
He continues to violate the conditions of his release to bail .	-2.8500
The message did not comment on the extension of the police invitation .	-3.5954
Assange fears that he will be sent to the United States from Sweden and charged him for possible spy accusations , having published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website .	-6.1178

Tax for foreign property owners against London ’ s speculative bubble	-2.0657
The Treasury has secularically calculated the CGT measure , but it is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who in the 2012 budget had imposed a 7 % tax on housing that costs over two million pounds and annual charges for buyers , housing as a company , not individuals .	-7.6666
Already , revenue from the StempelsTax for residential property in the district of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which was combined at GBP 708 million in fiscal year 2012 / 13 , revenue for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North-East , north-west , Yorkshire and Humber region .	-7.0301
Cook said : “ After the increases in the stemple tax on highly priced apartments and the introduction of the related legislation against a move , it is hard to say that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the impact of the outdated community control system . ”	-7.8636
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more cautious about buying real estate in London , or discouraging owners , ” he added .	-4.0088
First class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in London ’ s affluent southwest belt , ranging from Fulham to Wimbledon , have moved by a record value of 11.8 % last year .	-5.4060
Central London prices had an equal annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging domestic market in which the southern western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as an investigation from Savil .	-5.7428
Scientists could shed more light on the context in which the tail of a dog stands with its mood .	-3.2086
Early research showed that happy dogs with the cock were betting more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left with nervous dogs .	-6.0053
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and react to these subtle differences .	-2.1060
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscist at the University of Trient , said , “ People know well that the left and right brain groups react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions . ”	-5.1034
We have tried to look at this in other species .	-2.4315
He also pointed out that in dogs , as in humans , the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left side and vice versa , and that the two hemeshes played different roles in feelings .	-5.6004
In order to learn more about how dogs respond to the side pain of their fellow species , researchers monitored animals while the films of other dogs .	-7.2161
They measure the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior .	-2.7737
We will probably soon understand why the tail is heading in one direction , once in the other .	-3.6952
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate disgraceful other aspects , and we were able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-6.4341
When the animals saw how a dog , otherwise unleashed , moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wounding dog ) , it remained completely relaxed .	-5.8901
Was the tail tendency predominantly to the left ( back from the perspective of the dog , who wounds ) , her heart rate rose and she looked uncalm .	-6.9559
In the view of Professor Vallortigara , dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-3.9420
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should be concerned and when not .	-4.5570
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the wagon is rather friendly in a direction and the right side produces a less friendly behaviour , then you respond on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.8328
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians , and trainers could help to better understand their animals ’ emotions .	-8.3909
John Bradshaw , expert in dog behaviour and hospitality at the Faculty of Animal Practice at the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs .	-4.9386
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turn their head to the left when they see an aggressive dog , and to the right when they are a satisfied dog .	-4.9522
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ dogs tend to go to a robot dog if his , wagon ‘ left wounds , not to be left uncomfortable , just the opposite than in the Italian study . ”	-7.3679
According to his statement , the differences could therefore hinder that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs .	-4.8515
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.3405
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” so Bradshaw .	-4.0578
But since their behavior is simply recorded , it will probably not take long for us to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-11.9198
Arctic Monkeys postpone Glasgow due to Alex Turners disease .	-3.4971
The Arctic Monkeys rockband has moved an appearance in Glasgow after its lead stretcher is infected with the throat .	-7.9120

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February .	-2.2660
Pope Francis will , on 22 February , convene new cardinals of the Catholic Church , as the Vatican announced Thursday .	-8.1359
Cardinals are the highest rank clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also who choose a Pope so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.9407
There are now 201 cardinals .	-2.7791
However , a Cardinal that reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the poplar election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-4.9081
In a statement in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman of the Vatican , said that there will be a meeting of all Cardinal citizens before the ceremony is held for the appointment of the new cardinal lines , known as the Coniston .	-6.9441
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the Consortium in February , so that other meetings that require cardinal participation from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-4.7006
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals would probably have fallen by February .	-2.8016
He explained that a Pope usually appoint as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of eligible cardinals is 120 again , and as many cardinals as he wants .	-5.4513
The Constant Board next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , says Valero .	-4.1729
There is currently a certain amount of overhang on the European side , and Italy in particular .	-3.4549
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope of Cardinal from the rest of the world will appoint to rebuild the balance , ” he said . . the . the are . . , , ,	-8.0077
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.8508
The cardinal lines will also be the first to call the Cardinal Council , founded by Franziskus , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church .	-5.7894
In the past , the Pope chose everything by itself .	-1.6580
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-3.6434
He said that it is “ good ” that Francis would ask for advice from the cardinal .	-5.6381
But we have not been in this position so far – that is all new .	-3.9452
Valero said that typically the bishops from major places would be called cardinals , but Franzicus stands for “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints . ”	-6.1687
GM is calling back new pickup trucks in the US to repair seats .	-3.0839
General Motors is calling back almost 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GCC Sierra-Pickup trucks with the year 2014 to fix a problem with the manual adjustable seat restraints , such as a Friday U.S. Veterinary Regulatory Authority .	-6.6754
Some of the cars have a defect in the mechanism for turning back the front seat restraints .	-4.1431
For this reason , they do not meet the federal regulations for vehicle safety on header bases .	-4.9477
“ If from behind the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website was read .	-6.6727
The repurchased models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.8698
GM-Trucks began delivery in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-4.9198
GM informed the owner of the vehicle in the first half of October about the defect .	-1.7536
NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day district shutdown , which had had had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-5.5681
The sale of Silverado and Sierra-Trucks , which were newly developed for the 2014 model year , had increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , GM declared on Friday .	-4.5033
In October GM sold 42.660 Silverado and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup trucks .	-2.3616
The GM share rose 1.4 percent to $ 37.47 at the New York Stock Exchange on Friday afternoon .	-3.0672
Speaking a Obama voter	-3.3700
I chose President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-2.6993
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts to be thwarted by the Republicans ’ blockade tactics .	-3.2819
The blockade policy does not apologise for the Obamacare website problems , the drone attacks .	-3.0019
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible .	-2.7473
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-1.6991
I read a terribly sad book at the moment .	-2.6804
It is a book I thought it would give me hope during the trivial second year of my medical study .	-4.2725
It is called “ The Judaicity to Win ” ( courage to win ) and portrays the Memoirs of Barack Obama for the presidential election in 2008 .	-5.6879
When I am ready to bed with my patients in the evening , the book will take me back to a time when the politicians could rob millions of people and talk .	-7.0794
The election was held to a landslide and messenger in order to show the historic importance of this hour .	-4.7968
My classmates were happy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-3.7353
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-1.7786
When Obama entered office in 2008 , he had 82 % target .	-2.9655
And then I close the book .	-0.6932
Switching over to the present is a malicious awake as if one is torn away from a dream .	-4.6713
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.4988
In the years since I first took my vote , something has actually changed .	-3.4862
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.3149
I recognise the great and varied things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced trade in homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Ladens .	-3.5885
I , too , believe that the party political blockade tactics have clogged too many efforts with which our nation should be brought forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option , and Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-5.3333
But after I have defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my explanation .	-5.4176
I have reached a point of political despair .	-0.9590
The republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to stop or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-3.9854
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ private lives , and why whistleblower is punished that exposes government behavior .	-4.1769
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen without trial , has been murdered , and why public funding and spending limits will be circumvented during the presidential election .	-3.9762
It does not justify the results of a report in which it says that the efforts of the White House to restate the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.9416
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website in the more than three years since the Affordable Care Act was adopted .	-3.9111
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected .	-1.7575
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict its advanced political campaigns .	-8.4320
Apparently , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course because an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape public discussion .	-5.6753
But when I look at the examples above , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.0963
And that worries me most .	-2.6891
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.5413
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unintended alternative , he seemed unable to determine his direction and positions .	-4.1690
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope we had heard for so long .	-3.5086
But , with the sense of consent for Obama to below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become so hardened by this book .	-4.0465
It awakens in me the yearning for the many promises that have broken up in air .	-4.5581
This week I read a section in the book describing Obama ’ s serious loss of Clinton ’ s pre-election in Pennsylvania .	-3.6587
In a meeting with the electoral heroes after the decision , he told his staff that they would have to return to course and follow the purpose of their cause .	-5.4667
“ I want us to find our spell , ” he said .	-2.5031
We must remember who we are .	-0.9633
It is five years later , Mr President , and I cannot give you any more support .	-2.7719

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interests during parental leave	-2.5099
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters would be pregnant and could benefit from it .	-4.5680
The mining Magnant , which is in court about paying $ 6 million to carbon tax , claimed that when he wanted to wipe questions from the table , he would be in conflict .	-7.7901
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important in deciding whether to remove or cut CO2 and mining taxes .	-4.0491
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and that the killers of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws .	-3.4729
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters is pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not they receive holidays , ” Palmer said .	-4.2399
Two months after the election , the Palmer Electoral Commission officially announced 53 votes lead after the new narrative as the winner of the Sunshine-Coast session of Fairfax .	-5.2377
Palmer called for a review of the electoral narrative process so that it can take place faster .	-4.4961
Tony Abbott 's daughters Frances and Bridget .	-1.9602
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.6038
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-0.7875
Why should we not have a system where you can put the data into a computer and then select the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-6.4087
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils at marking the ballot .	-3.8356
Do you use them because you can then wipe out the results if you do not like them ?	-3.9171
Voting with pencil nowadays is incredible .	-3.3002
The Electoral Commission has examined the options for electronic voting and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-3.3880
Palmer , 59 , explained that one of his policies is an international airport for Sunshine Coast , and that he will take his new post very seriously .	-3.9581

RBS suspended two foreign-exchange traders	-2.4512
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign exchange department , two people familiar with the situation ; this is yet another indication that the global official identification of alleged currency manipulation is rapidly taking off .	-6.7323
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they are working with the authorities on investigations in the world ’ s largest financial market , with USD 5.3 trillion changing the owner every day .	-4.8479
The two traffickers would be the first RBS-employees to be suspended in the escalating investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor interbank .	-7.1097
The Bank , which has not posted a comment on Sundering , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .	-5.3677
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-2.9696
Last month , people close to the situation reported that the RBS passed the records of emails and Instant Messages sent by and to a former dealer to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-5.0909
This retailer , Richard Usher , had left RBS in 2010 and is now to be judged by his current position as European leader in forex trade in JPMorgan .	-5.3653
Ramchandani , Head of European Spot Trading at Citi , was arrested this week and Matt Gardiner , former senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended at Standard Chartered this week .	-4.5034
None of these retailers were charged with any misconduct .	-3.3496
Bankers belonging to the Instant Message Group of Usher at Barclays and Citigroup said the situation of nearby people .	-3.6560
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees , after the Swiss regulatory authority , Finma , stated that it would underwrite a alleged manipulation of the foreign-exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-6.2199
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority , Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently considering charges that bankers should have agreed to deal with the currency market .	-5.7655
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said people who are familiar with the situation .	-3.8438
Banks break Instant Messages and emails for several years in search of misconduct .	-3.8059
The news of these investigations has stirred traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year has been under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts the chances of speculators .	-5.4817
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading retailers believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.6061
A leading retailer noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the growing use of own internal platforms by banks led to “ having very low ticket prices can influence the market . ”	-6.1506
The news came out on the same day , when Credit Suisse announced that she married a merchant of her London Exchange Traded Funds-Büros this week after he had caused a loss of just $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-5.6064
The Bank informed the competent authorities promptly and cooperates with them .	-1.7250

That , however , did not disturb the actions of some 20 members of the citizens ' initiative . . . the were .	-12.1769
Her motto on the big poster was " We are against construction " .	-2.3390
In this way she wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - one day the giant project should fail .	-11.2365
When talking to many passers-by in front of the " site " , it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city 's project will be much better , even though not few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI .	-7.3709
But they are beginning to resign because the city continues to delay these responses , it is said from the BI .	-4.4186
As we have heard , public statements by the Mayor have also worked out .	-4.6659
In May , at the communal meeting , he said that he was afraid of leaving the thermal bath , the public should vote against the plans for a bath and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow when deciding to reach a citizens ' decision .	-8.0624
Some therefore appear to be quite frightened , others perceive it as a " clumsy extortion attempt " to the population , says in the press release of the BI .	-7.2150

Rangnick-Shept for Schiris : No Mane a Chad King .	-5.0414
As satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg is , the sports director of the " Bullen " was disappointed by the arbitrators .	-4.9988
" At the moment there is a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of gay kings , " he took the two offensive wives in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-6.7589
The most recent reason for Rangnick ’ s criticism was Yellow for Mane at the 3 : 0 against Val last Sunday , where the Senegalese became a supposed spectacle - which was not , however , as the TV images showed .	-10.1464
" A brave misdecision " , Rangnick said that the referee Harcame called " completely overstretched " .	-5.7153
Harcame also had contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Green-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-3.7827
He defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved the same way in every situation as Roger Schmidt " .	-3.8586
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the skirmish .	-3.4243
I do not know why .	-1.1381
" For I am the one who was offended " stressed the 46-year-old .	-2.6337
However , given the course of success , Rangnick agreed to praise .	-4.3979
" For this , there are only two words : right good , " he said .	-4.0642
There is not much to defer .	-2.3657
Above all , the way the team plays is impressive .	-1.9345
This should continue in a peaceful way .	-4.4712
There will be no changes in the winter transfer time .	-3.6826

Supreme Court confirmed Obama ’ s Health Law	-1.7672
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court decided today that the tightly affiliated health law is constitutional .	-4.8594
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the individual patient ’ s protection and Affordable Care Act – it forces American citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional within the state ’ s fiscal authority .	-4.7857
John Roberts , the chief judge , beat the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito , and Kennedy decided to do so .	-4.1778
The Court also confirmed the remainder of the 2700 pages of comprehensive law , and also took the view that the requirement for legislation on health that states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state medicaid requests is not unconstitutional .	-8.1640
The legal proceedings against the law were imposed by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-3.2289
The law was strongly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates , including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney , in 2012 .	-3.7121

So far sun-hungry had to go to a nearby summit in winter with a cable car .	-4.1783
Ten years ago , the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct the rays with mirrors into the valley .	-3.1098
This idea , however , has been in place since 1913 .	-3.8974
After several years of debate , the town council finally adopted the 5 million crown ( around EUR 615 000 ) expensive project .	-4.2939

Postal suffers barely on Sundays	-3.4457
" Many citizens have not yet noticed the red points for Sunday reading are still on various post boxes of the core city and the parts of the city , but you read the print on the yellow post office , you quickly find out that the reading on Sundays and holidays is no longer taking place " , the FDP shares with them .	-8.9367
A FDP request has confirmed this .	-2.2210
On Sundays and holidays , only in front of the post building in Ernst-Ludwig-Straße 36 and in Jakob-Müller Street 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-4.5324
Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still taught Sunday , the answer will not be given to the FDP request .	-4.2633
The German Social and Youth spokesman of the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to look back here .	-4.5478
Sonntagsleng is an important postal service just at Terminpost .	-6.6825
" This undertaking , despite the price increase for letters in January 2013 , is radically and unreasonable . "	-3.9788
Thomas Bittner , the leader of the Group of the European Liberal , Democrat and Reform Party , supports his group colleagues : " What annoys me is the fact that , here , patently , the reading times are changed or even removed " .	-7.3000
Close to the citizen , the post office is a mile away .	-3.4744
" At least , the post boxes in the district of Neuschloß and Rosengarten must be taught again on Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-6.2806
Even for the core city , especially not mobile fellow citizens , a mail box with sundays had to be reached .	-8.7162
Röhrenbeck asked in the Municipal Parliament whether the Municipal Administration would have talks with the post office on this matter .	-6.7526
Mayor Erich Maier said that the post did not communicate with lampertheim .	-2.3787
His knowledge , however , also gives a Sunday reading in Hofheim .	-4.3059
Your party advocated privatization .	-2.9975

Frankfurter Parkcharges are to increase considerably .	-3.6226
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive .	-3.1714
This morning , the city ’ s Magistrate advises about the presentation of a transport subsidiary Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-7.6392
This means that parking charges will be increased by 50 % .	-4.3071
However , it is not intended to increase prices , but to reduce the time interval of car parking machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-5.7114
In December , the Municipal Assembly will have to decide .	-3.9032
The retail committee of IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-4.0069
The possibility to park directly in front of the shop is " an inexcusable advantage for smaller retailers " .	-6.0751
The German Transport Club believes that an increase , after two decades , is ' perfectly adequate and , in fact , long overdue ' .	-4.6687
Local public transport will also be more expensive .	-2.0443
Freudentown : Spend quick actions rushing host .	-4.7790
With a narrow Kader , the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller School of Culture in Reutlingen against the TG Günningen from the Swabian Alps had to compete with .	-7.7964
The elders were with an experienced team on the other side of the network .	-4.1624
Soon , however , they could not fully support the rapid actions of the cities of Freude , even of age .	-7.1704
With the hard and burned proposals , the cinders were extremely difficult .	-7.4468
Once again , they had clean passports and attacks by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz , and were not present at the block defense .	-8.4399
Two high first Satz profits clearly expressed the superiority of the cities of Freude in all respects .	-5.9771
In view of this overwhelming and playful performance , the third sentence was gained somewhat quietly and sloping to the 3 : 0-endstand ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-6.0040
On November 2 , the Baiersbronn TV , which was able to assert itself clearly in Nagold , will have a far more powerful opponent in the field .	-6.1134
TSV Freudentown I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Raller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-2.8541
In the B class , the second crew of Baiersbronn and Freudentown stood in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-4.6640
They delivered a hard-fought two-hour match .	-2.5198
Initial nervousness on both sides caused errors and punctuary tendencies , as well as on passports , the precision at times was deficient and in some critical game scenes prevented the surfers from looking for possible score gains .	-10.0725
In this highly balanced meeting , however , the TSV team at Marcus Blasconto agreed to the great physical commitment and a pleasing commitment by both teams .	-6.8641
Carry Day on the Small English Cave	-4.8247
In the meanwhile fifth nursing day in the succession of the Natura 2000 project , Upper Hotzenwald met a group of committed participants at the small English hut in Ibach .	-5.6176
Due to popular suggestions , this day should be cut out in the vicinity of the hut of sight into the valley , Mayor Helmut Kaiser said .	-6.5266
Many hikers , emperors , described this area as the splendour of the gorge rock where the landscape is the ideal setting for magnificent views .	-5.7177
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that care day is an appropriate instrument to strengthen the connection between man and nature .	-5.4268
It gives every citizen the opportunity to place their own emphasis on nature .	-3.6166
At the same time as the tourist aspect , environmental consideration can also be taken into account .	-3.6895
This ecological aspect was explained by Friedericke Tribukait , by the Department of Nature Conservation of the State Presidency of Freiburg following the greeting by Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the arbitration and wanted a successful action .	-7.6312
According to Tribukait , the Viennese tourist goal is to preserve the now highly acclaimed old all-mendweidfeld with its specific types of habitat , by opening up and connecting to the remaining meadows .	-9.6023
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass butterflies , cannot overcome barriers in the form of woodland .	-3.4355
You need these free connections to conservation .	-2.8098
Tribukait said she would not miss it at this point to break a lance for the planned biospheric area .	-4.2309
In this planning , the current measure is not only seamless .	-4.2543
A biosphere field also provided the opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of the internationally recognised Unesco status , and thus a continuous addition to the progress made with the Life project and the nursing days to date for the future .	-7.2648
After these various presentations , editors Christoph Wehle and Life-Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff invited the volunteers to groups .	-5.7493
The larger trees had already been beaten in the run-up , and the forestry slippers may be removed .	-5.6789
A group of volunteers should take care of the release of wavelengers and to maintain a dry stone belt .	-5.4629
The goal was to take a free view of the viewpoint .	-2.7670

Information on the Internet : Although the Baar town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking schooling , children 's , youth and seniors policy , as well as its own urban buildings can be called an attractive city , no second mayor 's account has yet been announced .	-6.9403

Google , Samsung , Huawei sues for Nortel patents .	-3.2607
The group , which owns thousands of previous Nortels patents , imposed a avalanche on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers , including Google , the company that was overblown by him when Nortel 's insolvency auction .	-6.8928
Rockstar , the consortium that bought Nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringement in Texas , the US District Court .	-4.7480
Rockstar is located in the community of Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-2.9783
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.1182
Patents collect technology that conforms search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , thus the case that meets the core of Google 's search engine business .	-5.1380
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-3.1166
Samsung , Huawei , and HTC make mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products .	-3.2946
In 2011 , Google abandoned an initial bid of more than $ 900 million for Nortels .	-4.9954
Google increased its offer several times and recently offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.6817
After being outbid with Rockstar 's Nortel-Patents , Google Motorola Mobility expects $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also driven partly by Motorola 's library of patents .	-7.3504
“ Although Google has failed to acquire the patent on the auction , Google has violated and continues to do the patent , ” says the complaint .	-11.6518
Rockstars demand a high compensation on Google , as it claims that Google 's patent infringement is intentional , so the accusation .	-5.9873
Egypt Egypt Egypt Egypt Egypt Truly Elected Presidents	-6.4736
Mohammed Morsi discharges office , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt .	-3.7025
The Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was first freely elected president of the country , thereby antagonizing the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been forced out of office 16 months earlier .	-4.8832
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi was also the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth leader since the Monarchy overthrow some 60 years ago .	-4.1869
He placed the oath before the 18 black robes of the court , which has its seat at the Nile and has found an ancient Egyptian temple .	-6.4678
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-3.3074
“ Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , a true democracy , and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an American engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group , most of whom , since its foundation 84 years ago , had been strongly targeted by the respective government as a banned organization .	-6.5180
Hundreds of soldiers and police respect the building when Morsi joined a small car convoy shortly after 11 a.m. local time .	-4.7931
Just a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to celebrate the new president , and unlike the presidential Prunk of the Mubarak era , the traffic was stopped short so that the Autokonvoi could usually cross the busy road connecting the city with the southern capitals .	-8.5045
As the brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ substitute wheel ” , his personal prestige has grown since his victory and a Friday speech , presenting not only as a candidate for Islamists , but also of all those who wanted to target the efforts of the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-7.0604
“ Egypt is today a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the Mursi clashed in a blue suit with red collar , declaring the judges in the wooded chamber in which he placed office .	-7.5627
Later , Morsi went to the University of Cairo , where he was supposed to hold his inaugural speech .	-3.5388
He was officially welcomed by an armekapelle playing the national anthem he heard in Haachtsstellung .	-5.7209
The military leader Feldmarshall Hussein Tantawi was present .	-3.6003
On his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the largest hearing hall of the university with speakers of “ The army and the people are a hand ” .	-5.4807

Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend .	-1.2210
The company has increased its overall profit prospects and is expecting record revenues from Australia and Great Britain tourists .	-4.6855
The travel company now runs from a adjusted annual gain before taxes between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to 315 million in its previous forecast .	-4.2072
If the current target levels are achieved , that means a 12-17 % growth compared to a record winning of $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .	-5.4705
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre received eight percent earnings in the first six months and granted a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in Australian and British private businesses .	-6.0776
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well in the direction of record year revenues before interest and taxes , ” he explained .	-4.4273
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which typically belong to our largest contributors .	-3.5692

Studies show that in English schools less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries .	-2.9178
On the other hand , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-9.4421
While there will be no formal requirement to envisage more time for mathematics in the hour-plan , it is said that , in coalition circles , the comprehensive matheses – combined with a greater emphasis on the profession in Ranglists – will probably encourage schools to set more hours .	-7.0890
The curriculum focuses more on “ issues from real life , ” including financial mathematics .	-3.1790

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum	-2.5914
At the next Ecumenical Forum on Monday , 21 October , at the New Museum of the Palace , the theme of " The Highness with Hölle - Theological considerations about how to deal with the last things " .	-7.5992
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-2.1200
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parish Salem , the Salem Castle and the Ministry of Culture .	-3.8790
Johanna Rahner wants to follow up on the question in the forum , as today people are putting the " last things " after death .	-6.4490
If people had known too much about this over the past centuries , setting on the pictures of heaven and hell , " which until now dominate our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic lesson of the hopes for perfection would be more of a certain embarrassment or even of impotence .	-9.2139
" The greater hope has been exaggerated by religious criticism " says the referendum .	-3.5890
You gave us " so many questionnaires that we seem to have got rid of the signs " .	-4.8820
Johanna Rahner continues to say : " But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death . "	-4.3049
That brings the question of the longing , " which dreads that everything should be good at the end of the day " .	-5.7870
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic theology and biology at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-1.9453
She holds a PhD in 1997 as Dr. theol . , also in Freiburg .	-3.9198

Illmensee : Second mountain bike race excited participants	-9.1749
In good weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hills around the lake .	-5.5506
Ulrich Knotel shares this with the organised sports association Illmensee .	-4.5735
Among the participants , in particular at the shortest distance of more than 15 km and 300 metres of altitude , a number of people who wanted to practise their hobby once in competition mode .	-8.2656
Two junior drivers of the German top-class were also on the start in this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German championships .	-5.2731

Pascal Treubel could be placed again on second place .	-4.0846
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli from Team Albertrau who made it to the top of the victorious circle .	-5.9821
On the second and three Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen .	-3.2343
A welcome development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-2.6990
Not only in terms of its ability to perform , the entire spectrum was represented by athletes .	-4.8762
The age structure was one of the oldest starters for the youngest up to 70 years .	-5.1660
In the main race , more absolute top athletes were launched this this year .	-4.0945
Four drivers were able to depart from the top regional drivers .	-2.1124

The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-1.7037
For 21 years , Georges Bshalt saw how his sick father repeatedly lost the consciousness and traveled to hospitals that had not had the means to help him .	-5.1350
Jamef Bwave was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon in 1981 .	-4.8784
At first , he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation extended to his brain and caused a hemom that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.9226
“ There were no neuroscience in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwave .	-4.5224
We would have released him from Cameroon if we had had the money .	-3.1963
Instead , he spent years helping his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-4.4100
“ It ’ s not easy , ” commented Bwave .	-3.3127
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-4.3199
There are many patients .	-1.4286
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.6176
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles father died in 2002 .	-2.5866
Cameroon has only one doctor for every 5,000 people , the World Health Organization .	-3.3563
In contrast , the ratio in the United States is 413 with a doctor .	-3.1567
But even if there is a doctor for them , most Camerians could not afford to visit .	-3.9145
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of rural health spending are private .	-3.5547
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-2.6411
Poverty makes it impossible to live .	-1.6193
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffer from seeing in Bsham the decision to do something about it .	-4.3022
Dr. Georges Bshaft and his volunteer team carried out 700 free operations last year .	-3.1245
He became a doctor and worked as a surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaounde .	-3.9410
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas during weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.7162
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped nearly 32,000 people .	-1.9713
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people sail in small buses and go with the sealed medical equipment on the roof over unfettered terrain to the villages that need help .	-6.1439
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-2.1866
More than once , they have had to put the vehicles on rivers and mud .	-5.4679
But when they arrive they will be received like heroes : a feast , singing and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-4.2467
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and lead – with its broad smile and limitless energy – is happy to attend the joyful celebration .	-5.4415
The next morning the team begins with a survey of hundreds of patients .	-2.6758
“ We handle 500 people per trip , ” says BWade .	-6.2227
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-2.9375
Each of these weekly clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-3.2684
Many people are treated because of malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.6299
Others get crocks , donated glasses or free birth customers – a document that is required for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-4.5861
In the evening the team performs simple operations with a local smell .	-8.0185
The operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after intervention patients are up and go in the relaxation area to make space for the next .	-5.8465
The illumination for the OP and the disinfectant is stored by the generator of the group , thus working Bshaft and its volunteers until the early morning hours on Sunday .	-6.0928
It is an exhaustive pensum , but the villagers usually help to keep the team motivated .	-11.5831
" You are braking all night so that we can stay vigilant and continue our work , " says Bsham .	-6.7979
On Sunday , the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work that has been done .	-4.4838
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that with their work it makes a huge difference to the people to whom it helps .	-5.0599
A man explained that the free operation of a trunk he received now allows him to work again .	-3.8754
“ This changed the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.3668
In addition to the weekly clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bshalt also works in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-5.3766
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , so the rest come from private donations .	-4.5652
“ I really do not know when he sleeves , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and worked voluntarily in Bwelles Group .	-4.0388
He is always in hospital or trying to make money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-4.3648
For medical and health students such as O 'Malley , who come from the United States and Europe and support the Bshan , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-5.3252
“ We can be there for operations where we help to collect blood or keep the tools for Dr. Bwave , ” O 'Malley explains .	-5.5746
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.0282
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitary material .	-5.1353
If you are in Yaounde , however , BWE takes care of accommodation , transportation and guide .	-6.8272
“ He is undoubtedly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.4319
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the people of Cameroon knows no boundaries .	-3.6259
For Bshaft , the almost constant work is not a burden .	-3.3747
To help others achieve a more prosperous life , thereby fulfilling a promise that he gave to his father , is a great pleasure for him .	-6.3128
“ I am so happy when I make this work , ” says Bsham .	-4.0483
And I am thinking of my father .	-0.7504
I hope he will see what I do .	-1.3562
I do it to bring people back to laugh and to relieve the pain .	-2.5499

Finding the Battle Excellently	-3.0739
The role of the Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to the body by Horst Janson .	-3.9889
Janson is himself an old hare in his mettle , the art of acting .	-5.2554
The old man Santiago cannot imagine anything about fishing .	-2.9429
So the two are simply great .	-2.5664
It is almost thought that the wrinkles in the nod of the old man , of which the young fisherman speaks , can be seen .	-6.4922
When Santiago tired of life on the chair , Janson is true .	-2.7820
The role of the old fisherman is also played by and by a character role that Janson is well managed .	-7.6933
Hemingway narrated the story of a warrior , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge , and also his will .	-11.9038
Janson is on stage in much of his life as an actor .	-8.2480
He creates to focus the attention of the audience , so his monologues are not boring for a moment .	-5.3369
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea is made up of blue illuminated water bottles .	-4.4236
Directly Jens Hasselmann leaves the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-3.5972
In the course of his performance , he sets the active scene into light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst , whose vivid vocation of his songs and her wonderful voice brings together Kubas 's sense of life .	-9.3465
The four musicians play Kubas Rhythm for it and are also guests of the bar .	-3.0218
Tourism : descent to the Romans	-1.5650
At about 120 metres in length a seawater channel is available below Cologne .	-5.2666
Visiting Cologne will not pass by the cathedral .	-4.0276
Around 157 meters , the two towers go into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.4327
But only a few visitors , who admired the two filigranes of the church , realise that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-7.0469
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne 's subworld .	-2.3326
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne Tourism directly at the cathedral .	-3.5732
The tour starts most unconventional : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulz .	-3.9848
In the seventies , the city fathers wanted to be an autogenic city , and that is why the remains of the old town wall remained only that which was not too large .	-6.0831
Most users of the park house now also have to leave the Roman remains and leave only their car .	-6.4822
But if you look more closely , the D2 park deck discovered an archaeological site divided by metallic grid rods .	-6.4307
You can see about five metres high ruins of handmade stones .	-3.7415
" It is the remains of the Roman city wall built in Christ in the second half of the first century , " says Schulz .	-3.3648
Before going back to the daylight , the entrants at the upper parkland will take a look at a dark 15 metre deep cock .	-6.6712
This is the well of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly recognized .	-4.1754
Next stop of the round is the Pretoria , and here the participants return to the depth .	-5.4922
We are here to see the seat of the once-most powerful man north of the Alps , the preacher of the CCA .	-5.2564
What CCA means is a visitor to know .	-2.5468
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agripponium " , which in good German means " the city of Roman law and city of the Agripponins , founded under Kaiser Claudius at the village of the Altar , means " .	-6.0661
And the Pretoria is the former palace of the castle , the centre of the Roman Empire in the Rhine .	-5.4959
From the entrance of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman wastewater channel , which is here at about 120 metres in length .	-5.3322
" You can easily walk a bit along the " Cloaca Maxima " , when you want " , the visitors mutate .	-14.3272
A surprise has more training .	-4.0843
After taking the key at the cashier he leads the group to a 16 meter deep , movable look .	-5.4456
" We are now in Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-2.3349
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-14.5136
To this day , in the lower end of Mikwe , whose origins go back to the eighth century , different waterstands are possible by changing furs of the Rhine .	-7.0999
Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Rathausplatz , for which the construction works will begin shortly .	-4.2690
However , a few years will pass until completion .	-4.1458

A bloody attack in the rock milieu is reopened after four years .	-3.3651
A trial for attempted extinction , dangerous physical injury and damage to two 30-year-olds began before the district court of Frankfurt ( or ) .	-6.4918
It is accompanied by strict security measures .	-2.0104

Obama ’ s Rethinking on Health Policy	-2.2653
Following strong criticism , President Obama made a resignation yesterday in his frequent , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-5.3035
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of notice , Republicans have told the president in recent days that he has misled the American public .	-5.0691
Yesterday , Obama relativized his original promise .	-2.0176
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-2.8483
In response to the numerous media reports on the announcements , Obama urged Americans who received such messages to look around the free market after a new insurance .	-4.4301
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price , or more cheaply than anticipated .	-3.9894
“ You come from a better offer , ” he said .	-6.8189
The government said it was no surprise that the five per cent of the population who had completed their own insurance would have to go to another rate , because their treaty does not match the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-7.0039
“ I would like to say to these Americans very directly : you deserve better , ” said Severius at a hearing before the Washington House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee .	-5.4015
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Acts , explained that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-9.5890

This statement of an enlightened seclius to an adviser behind her sitting at yesterday 's hearing at the House of Representatives was introduced after a dispute with the Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri , asking whether she should be required to participate in Obamacare .	-16.1485
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly insisted on the question of why the “ architects ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily dispense with a state-sponsored insurance to end itself a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which she now wanted to sell millions of Americans .	-6.1981
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian airspace .	-3.2192
An American government officer who wanted to remain anonymously stated on Thursday that Israel 's fighter planes had attacked an airborne base in Syrian Latkia a one day before .	-7.5397
The objective was ' rockets and assigned equipment ' , which the Israeli government feared was intended for the Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-4.9013
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the Latakia port city had been shot on Thursday night , and Israelis were responsible for it .	-6.4629
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , where Russian defensive missiles from the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles had a range of 35 kilometers and can carry up to 70 kilograms .	-7.0554
The Jerusalem Government has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.6405
However , the news agency Reuters quotes an Israeli official , too anonymous , in the words he believes that Israel has executed the attack , but not sure .	-11.4765
In any case , a spokesman for the Israeli defence ministry said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.3301
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in Yedioth Ahronoth ’ s daily newspaper that the Syrian regime had already tried earlier , partly successful , to supply ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-3.8854
The Israeli government had repeatedly warned that any attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean exceeding a " red line " that would follow a military response .	-3.2737
John Kerry ’ s unprecedented recognition that the US espionage has “ gone beyond adequate . ”	-4.0776
John Kerry suggested , with an unexpected admission , that the US ’ s defensive attitude toward its surveillance programs should be blurred by saying that , in certain cases , espionage has “ gone inappropriate too far . ”	-7.1017
The foreign minister also admitted that he was responsible , together with Barack Obama , for being outdated on “ autopilot , ” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about NSA ’ s espionage activities .	-5.8188
The leaked information has brought the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation on its allies .	-4.4436
In a video speech at the London Open Government Conference , Kerry said : “ The President and I , as well as others in the government , have experienced some of the things that have almost gone by car pilot simply because the capacity was to come back to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to 11 September . ”	-9.0260
He then admitted , as the first senior member of the US government , that the US espionage had crossed a border , but also emphasized that no rights had been abused .	-4.4777
He said , ‘ in some cases , that has not gone too far . ’	-3.0987
The President is determined to clarify the situation and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel the same thing in this case is abuse .	-7.0342
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-2.2512
Kerry , however , insisted that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through its surveillance operations .	-3.9135
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world where people are willing to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.8232
There is a radical extremism in the world that is anxious to kill people , spray into the air , and attack governments .	-3.6799
So what if we were able to catch and stop before it happens ?	-3.5063
We have , in fact , prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the killings of people , because we have experienced such plans in the run-up to them .	-5.5068
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to allay concerns about the supposed American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US on anti-terrorism sentiments , as the chairman of the Senats-Subcommittee on European Affairs said on Thursday .	-5.6110
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week and is concerned about her threats to stop taking part in anti-terrorism organisations because of the frustration that the National Security Agency is monitoring .	-5.2277
“ It is very important for the national security interests of the US that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who is in Senate for the first time in democracy , who is chairman of the Senats-Subcommittee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-6.5362
I will also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.6997
Media reports that the NSA gathered millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , although the leader of the intelligence this week said that the reports are incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by Nato allies and exchanged with the United States .	-5.5300
Other revelations quoted from Snowden 's subsequent documents , according to which the NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other world leaders .	-4.4300
The head of national secret services , James Clapper , defended the espionage of allies as necessary and declared that this was customary on both sides .	-4.0404
In all of the tumult , Murphy said that his authority was preparing the congress trip this year and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers .	-12.0895
The names of the other Members involved will be published in the coming days .	-2.9742
He said the exact route was still prepared .	-2.1625
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of travel is to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.3053
He said that European governments should be honest about the kind of espionage programs they have used for years .	-3.6913
“ While we can change our surveillance programmes and thus protect the rights of Europeans better , they must also be able to cope with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy , ” says Murphy .	-5.5848
Meanwhile , John Kerry is on a weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the rally over the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , and US surveillance activities .	-4.1076

Australians appealed against imprisonment in Thailand	-3.1071
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney , who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket because she wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver , has appealed against the judgment and was released on bailout .	-5.0953
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first found guilty of having made a façade by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 , after telling the Thai police that a local taxi driver had raped them in the morgens of Sunday 10 June , while two other men kept them .	-6.8575
Later , however , the photos of a video camera showed that she had arrived safely in her hotel after being separated from her Australian friend .	-4.7337
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until she admitted that history had come to light .	-5.4002
It was held on the ground in police custody until the trial .	-4.0956
Bahford was sentenced to a 15-day imprisonment in a low-level detention centre on the fringe of Phuket , instead of a prison for adult women .	-4.8649
She is the daughter of Peter Tucks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy-League , who asked to help his daughter , the State Department in Canberra .	-5.3417
Tunks explained to the Sunday telegraph in Sydney that the whole family is “ extreme concern ” about the wellbeing of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-4.4120
“ Of course , we have great concerns , but we hope it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tucks .	-4.4363
Bahford appealed against the verdict and is against a bailout of 50,000 Baht at large .	-4.5043
In Australian reports it was read that in the meantime it makes holidays in the resort of Krabi in Southern Thailand .	-3.4617
The court ’ s Vontage had to hear that Bahford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the vocation could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-5.8550
It is also possible , however , that Thailand , after the recent assassination of the travel agency Michelle Smith in Phuket , could try to improve its targeted tourist image and , therefore , be free to do so .	-6.9570
