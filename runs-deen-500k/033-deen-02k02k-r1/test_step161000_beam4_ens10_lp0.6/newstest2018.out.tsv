Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city .	-2.6323
An Irren institution where young people are to meet today .	-4.1850
A tomb chapel now being digged for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-2.8467
Small-scale farmers managed the former reason .	-2.0513
Munich ’ s oldest official map promotes exciting stories on days .	-1.6814
It nerves if maps are not current .	-2.2099
Everyone who had to get excited already , because the Auto Navi , instead of a bypass , showed a green meadow .	-4.2661
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer of the State Government ’ s Geoportal Bavaria , are far from topical - but that is why they are very interesting .	-6.2032
Especially when you compare them with current online cards .	-2.1299
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed since the 19th century in the distribution area of Munich Merkur .	-2.8065
The digital Bavarian Atlas is a patchwork that is not identified as such .	-4.3058
The large overview card has been incorporated for cities and municipalities with more detailed maps , called Urpositions sheets .	-5.6571
They were created in accordance with the Bavarian Measuring Administration between 1810 and 1864 and emerge from the first measurement of Bavaria .	-4.9892
Your Client : Napoleon .	-1.2321
The French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria since spring 1800 during the Second Coalition War .	-2.4039
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and ordered Bavarian topographic recording - for military purposes , of course .	-3.6219
Although French troops finally withdrawn from the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , today ’ s neighbors created the idea of a comprehensive Bavarian card .	-3.3781
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued the project , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian Measurement Administration .	-3.6823
The Origin Journal for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian State Library .	-13.3451
Today , the comparison of earlier / today is most impressive in the in times .	-16.2380
The city has expanded in every direction and has grown together .	-3.0773
An example of this is subsendling , which appears in the map of 1856 still relatively isolated .	-2.7657
Sendling was introduced 21 years after the creation of the map , i.e. 1877 , as a part of Munich .	-4.7906
Today , Untersendling is located in the heart of the city .	-2.6426
The subsendlings are concentrated around 1856 along the current Plinganserstraße , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the insurgency of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-3.7864
Where the Western Park is today , there are nothing to be seen as fields - at first glance : a smaller card with dozing lines and numbers appears : handwritten numbered corridors from so-called " urbanization " , from which the property tax was derived .	-5.6882
Small parcels there are no longer showing farmers there , but small-scale farmers of the " land in Sun " plant .	-4.6904
A large green area is distinguished north of subsendling .	-2.8576
Theresienwiese , since 1810 the setting of Oktoberfest , was indeed a meadow in the nineteenth century - not a concrete desert .	-3.8276
On the other hand of the Isar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.1133
In today 's Au-Haidhausen district , you can read not only the street name " at Gasteig " or the hill " On the vents " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-5.2289
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstrasse , people were once blocked with madness .	-3.5475
In 1858 / 59 the Munich circle Irrenal " On the Auer Lefts " was created .	-5.0157
As of 1872 , Dr Bernhard von Gudden headed the installation - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwigs II .	-17.6103
" He was progressively for his time and ended , for example , the chains of so-called mistakes .	-3.3724
He also prohibited the staff from applying violence against the occupants " , says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Haidhausen , who has dealt with an exhibition with the Institute .	-4.1911
For 280 patients , it was first spaced , then expanded to 500 places .	-4.2188
At some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circle aircraft in Haar 1905 .	-4.2651
Since 2006 the Isar-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatrics , has been located there .	-13.0491
On the premises of the former Auerstalt , young people meet in the Munich Salesianum .	-4.4478
The Order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth house with training companies .	-3.4710
Western lies the football pitch of TSV München East , east of living houses from the 1980s .	-3.6665
In 2015 , the children ’ s house " Casa Don Bosco " was built in the architectural landscape of the Irrenal Institute , which was destroyed by bombing attacks in World War II .	-5.8912
The main square was in 1856 , the Kaufingerstrasse was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.4679
The Second World War also made a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-3.0903
The Allied bombs took many holes to the city centre in December 1944 .	-3.0251
A big stay to this day - at the Marienhof .	-2.8206
The English Institute , small business houses and a Middle Ages copel once stood at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work is carried out on 5 April 2017 at the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn Train .	-6.6521
The slider can compare the old Munich card with today 's airscreen - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-13.9897
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-1.7626
The National Association for the Promotion of Carbing has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri on the basis of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.3253
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay special attention when travelling through the State and to make extreme caution , because a number of questionable , race-based incidents are occurring and noticed recently throughout the State , " says it in the opinion of the group .	-7.0128
A recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination , and the law enforcement authorities of the state , which aim disproportionately for minorities , prompted the group to issue the warning of travel , said NAACP .	-5.2401
" You have violations of civil rights that people pass .	-2.5125
They are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-2.4529
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . '	-2.0546
It is the first such warning that the Organization for a US State has issued .	-2.8968
The group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-1.8863
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no petrol during his journey through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of crime .	-4.9766
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Office of the Public Prosecutor of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the state are more frequently stopped than white .	-3.7943
" The recommendation is that people are aware of themselves and inform their families , friends and staff of what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.8514
" People must be willing to bring deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-4.1617
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime reporting program , which classified the state for the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country .	-4.4741
The travel warning is also an answer to a new missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-3.0594
Prior to this , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , after the States adopted immigration laws that obliged local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for infringements of immigration , which in the view of the ACLU will contribute to further racial profiling .	-4.8512
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the in the US .	-3.2835
Weidezaun project is fundamental .	-3.0078
The Fisherbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.0870
The CDU federal MEPs Peter Weiß and Kordula Kovac have gained an image on the grou.	-12.5823
At the Schwendemann Rightgrabenhof , representatives of the Fisherbacher CDU Association met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-3.3475
Markus Schwendemann initially gave insights into his plant , managing 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , providing 40 dairy cows and as many young people as possible and housing in five apartments .	-4.6767
The " Black Forest Milk " is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-3.4878
On the table of our tourists comes exclusively regional .	-4.1641
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the grandeur project " fundamentally important " .	-4.0720
I cannot make a profit on such steep land .	-2.9289
The greenland area cares for a lot of work , and much has to be done with the engine sense .	-4.1979
" We have to fight here with the conditions and with the topography " , Swendemann stressed .	-3.3756
In 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser , even if he does not lead to biobetry .	-4.5582
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality recognizes the importance of the grandeur project and is happy about the leader promotion " .	-4.6174
At the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare , farmers would have to be supported .	-3.0466
Hopefully it will be possible to extract the surfaces for a long time to come .	-5.3948
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they carry on farming , " said the mayor .	-3.7199
Farmers often find themselves in criticism of this aid because of its support .	-4.8129
In 2013 , a total of 25 parcels of 11 participants were fenced by wickers .	-4.7443
The farming area is 40 hectares , which must not be supported by at least 2023 .	-4.4752
Half of the total cost of EUR 71 500 was promoted above Leader , a quarter the municipality of Fischerbach .	-3.9964
Farmers thus remain EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wild fence .	-13.5777
" The big advantage is the longevity of the fences " explained Swandemann .	-2.8286
Kordula Kovac said : ' You are doing a good job , without farmers and farmers it is not . '	-3.6523
Peter White also stated : " Here the best food is produced " .	-3.5444
The Baden-Württemberg Landscape Fleece Directive ( LPR ) enables state support for wild fences .	-4.0486
The aim is to open up the Black Forest .	-2.1345
It is essential that we have one support scene called the LPR .	-4.5351
Furthermore , the fenced surface must not be sluggish ( approximation of 35 % ) and must be threatened with afforestation .	-5.7921
For the 2018 Fisherbacher Weidezaunproject , the application for eight participants is currently running with 24 parcels , which wish to build almost 16 kilometres of fence . and , in , , in , and , , and in the .	-18.7603
The disclosure area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-3.6058
Is nothing sacred ?	-1.0192
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statute for Freedom .	-2.6590
The safest sign of regime change is when they start to attack the statues .	-2.3651
The Americans appreciate it as much as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.4749
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president ’ s proposals for drastic restriction of legal immigration to the state of freedom .	-4.2406
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-10.4267
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-2.7846
But he attacked its importance , and in particular the importance it attributed when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to its base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-3.3943
As Miller Acosta shouted : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the statue of freedom is a symbol of American freedom that enlights the world .	-4.4058
The poem to which you refer , which was added later , is not part of the original statue of freedom . '	-3.2201
Miller is factually right , but as he put it himself , it is not really about history .	-3.1842
It is about the contemporary resonance to Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your murders , your poor , / your afflicted masses who seem to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts " .	-6.3126
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " was better visible on our screens .	-2.9534
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.5552
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a wider political and cultural debate : it is indeed a conflict about America ’ s importance .	-3.5817
Lazarus - and her friends who campaigned to base their words on her death - knew very well that they took a highly political act .	-5.0818
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a secondary classic image .	-20.4897
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-2.7928
And she gives himself a very different name : Mother of the exiles .	-2.7919
The combination of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-1.8218
Just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people wanted to change this long ago from the right wing .	-3.2642
The Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of the Beacon for Trump ’ s coming , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Freedom is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative , bringing the American flame to the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-5.4080
It is intended to wear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.6700
The torch is not intended to enlighten the way into the United States . '	-16.1732
Unusual has Limbaugh encountered something here .	-2.6443
The importance of the statue is quite simply a matter of perception .	-2.2916
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often horrific journeys on the ceilings of ships .	-4.2942
The real issue is to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and improving their lives .	-2.8869
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.6992
And that , of course , is not the perspective Miller and Trump ever wants to acknowledge .	-2.6683
Their flag is not to enlighten the way , but to exploit the hatred that is their only source of power .	-4.2974
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom Team	-11.8820
Eilidh Doyle is reminiscent of a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team was a team by Great .	-4.4512
The UK Lightweight athletics Director Neil Black says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championship Hall will make a massive contribution to the team .	-4.0873
A record number of Scottish athletes has been selected for London 2017 , which will start Friday .	-2.0024
Black believes that ' develops something special in Scotland ' and the United Kingdom 's light athletics must learn something from it .	-3.8412
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to do so until we find it out , " said black .	-12.7609
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.6116
The Scottish athletes think that there is something to do with what they have done .	-2.2726
British athletics : there is something to do with what they have done .	-2.6988
And also with the type on the street corner .	-1.7358
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.5324
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal attackers , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who are run against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 metres distance , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team .	-5.2604
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.1615
Her capitan speech was incredible , " says Black .	-1.5784
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or whatever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-2.8979
The passion and the real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in was great ' .	-3.4564
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take part in her fifth World Championships at the 400 m hurdles , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-18.5746
Scotland ’ s best total of athletes at the World Cup was seven achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.1465
Last year , Muir ’ s medium-range runner leads along this road and set up five British and two European records .	-5.3426
It will take part in the 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres .	-2.9703
Chris O 'Hare , which runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot that should be observed after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.1945
Doyle reminds itself of her first world championships , when the only other Scot was at Lee McConnell .	-3.7726
The team 's captain says that she is ' enormously proud ' to the fact that many of her compatriots will not only belong to the team , but also , in some cases , in the medals and the finals .	-23.1961
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and voted for me , making it quite special for me , " she added .	-4.8929
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.7594
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.5915
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to podia .	-2.6172
As for my speech as a captain ?	-2.1735
Yes , I think she went well .	-11.2800
I simply pointed out that in this situation we are very happy because we have a home world championship .	-3.8660
So it is really important to rely on this homesupport and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.3707
I have a second chance to go out and compete and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there . '	-19.6094
Blocking critics about Facebook : do not buy a public office unless you can ’ t tolerate voters ’ heating .	-4.8305
The father of our country knew something of a bad press .	-1.1921
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles .	-2.3892
He securely shouted in criticism .	-3.4002
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.0295
Because in 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are being led to slaughter like the sheep ' .	-3.7823
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.4500
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions from at least 450 people who have expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-2.8647
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him early this week .	-2.5876
The Governor 's staff dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-13.5721
" It is only Facebook , " said many people .	-1.7574
But it is important .	-0.7279
And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan .	-1.8665
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is surprisingly popular .	-2.3664
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.1622
Hogan is not a reactionary heat .	-1.2005
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict observance of principles .	-3.0373
He was also very skillful in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-3.6846
Therefore , the blocking of those who come to the side of the governor - a public forum that is called official and paid by employees paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.6710
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor , arguing that blocking comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-2.7612
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hatred filled people who swing online .	-3.0974
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-1.8165
And these are just real people who speak to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a parish , not a troll .	-3.1574
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-2.4250
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and called on Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-2.2299
Lakshmi Lakshmi Sarma Ramani from Bowie , Md . , was not hatred , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.2988
" I commented courteously that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news " , she wrote in the comment area of the news broadcast " The Post " .	-3.1867
" I do not appreciate this idea either if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are disregarded by some rather than a so-called collective use and not recognised as a large group of affected citizens " .	-5.8096
What governor ’ s staff called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call a “ language . ”	-4.7333
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.1223
It is much cleaner than in the past if one had done the same thing that staff had been sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-3.8711
This is exactly what is happening in digital terms .	-2.1714
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for immunizing Facebook and other social media .	-2.3165
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.8216
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-1.1010
The chairman of the Loudoun County ’ s Board of Supervisor injured the First Amendment , according to US district judge James Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-11.0204
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.6279
It should not be so difficult .	-2.1126
Currently , Washington ’ s affordable porto had a similar effect as the Internet .	-2.4741
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letter-writers embarked on his leadership .	-3.4951
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-0.9529
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " write all letters to newspapers that brought Washington 's decisions .	-2.8701
Petitions who criticised his position on the Treaty of Amity , Trade and shipping with the United Kingdom overwhelmed his position , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-3.6749
But he did not silence them .	-0.9696
Freedom of speech , disagreement and discourses are the basis of our nation .	-2.5301
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.6054
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort at the Renaissance Club .	-1.5535

Less Lunge Cancer Down by Passive Smoking	-2.6588
Over the past two decades , fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer .	-2.0010
Scientists at the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) come to a study .	-3.2902
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer deaths are due to passive smoking per year , " said Heiko Becher study manag. canthe , by , , , , in , , by , , ,	-10.9987
He made a comparison of his own study on the subject of in in 199.	-3.8459
At that time there were 400 lung cancer cases for passive smoking per year in Germany .	-2.7194
The new investigation is published in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-2.1687
Domestic connections prove very complex .	-15.1681
The construction works in Villinger Strasse are underway and " are somewhat in time " so the head of the building house Fred Heinze .	-4.5896
In the area of housing connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , as there is much hiding underground , which is not included in the plans .	-4.1862

The frightened children said they should turn on their headlights .	-3.0382
One of the soldiers took offence on their tone and later returned with four soldiers , such as the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-3.6793
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the group with their guns , said sacrifices and witnesses .	-2.4797
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.8572
A child , 16 year old Yulianus Yeimo , was beaten so hard that he fell into the coma .	-14.7882
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set in fire , and things escalated the next day .	-14.9530

When the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers about an internal funk : " When the masses afford more than three times resistance , shoot them dead , " it is said in an official document of TIME , which was not released to the local media .	-4.6980
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto Quarter of Enarotali , saw the threat and called upon calm and urged the quantity to return home .	-3.7887
No one was listening to the mood .	-1.8599
" When I turned around , I was shot suddenly in my left hand journey , " he said TIME at the veranda of his colourful wooden house .	-14.6201
Kayame still does not know who was fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-3.0425
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he added .	-1.3436
The local man Alfius Youw was met three times , according to his cousin , who was witnessing the shooting .	-3.5765

Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi delivered a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathies for the victims ’ families and swore to address the historical grievances in Papua .	-3.8361
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so it will no longer happen in the future , " he said .	-2.4940
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historic human rights violations .	-2.3122

" Most injuries have occurred a long time ago .	-8.9913
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s .	-1.5064
The point is that we have committed ourselves to addressing these infringements , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .	-3.2847
Then Wiranto retreated when he talked to TIME on 5 June and said that he did not have any plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.2695
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.3219
Wiranto , accused of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor ’ s bloody vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been settled in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-3.8023
Families of the Paniai victims took such claims with grave inbelief .	-4.1230
" I was interviewed four times over the last three years , but there was no progress , " says Yohanes .	-1.7944

The shooting have not stopped .	-2.0501
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais ’ neighbourhood Deiyai .	-2.5248
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.4117
The man who was 24 years old Ravianus Douw , who was drunk when he fished in a nearby river , died on the way to hospital .	-3.1940
Escorted villagers protested before the company ’ s office .	-3.2612
The police said that villagers thrown stones on officers responding by firing warnings .	-2.3877
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot and killed one .	-2.0051
" We were so panic , we were afraid there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Domingu Badii who lives near the hospital and was witnessing how the injured here was quickly delivered , says TIME .	-4.8088

Paniai was always a troublemaker for the Indonesian government .	-13.9212
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of tribal nationals of the sea , Moni , Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-4.1927
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , which claims to defend the Papua 's rights by launching sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-2.6611
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-2.0413
In response to this in recent years , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily imprisoned on the pretext of securing national sovereignty .	-3.4183
Some never dive again .	-2.6304
Paniai is known among the people of Papua as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.2338
Poverty reinforces discontent .	-1.7516
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-2.2958
Brot is the same as except reach .	-3.3095
People here are building up everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and vegetables .	-2.5165
Agriculture is the task of women who can process four or five fields of sweet potatoes .	-3.1693

Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants who have greater numbers since the opening of new routes to Nabira airport .	-18.6021
The few jobs that exist in the region usually go to better educated and prosperous migrants .	-3.0620
Papua rarely have capital or the capital needed to run their own companies competitively .	-3.2452
" The young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money , " says John Gobai , the chairman of the Paniai tribal Council .	-3.8583
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.2728
Furthermore , restrictions on reporting remain tense to international media .	-2.9867
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudy and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , although they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.7381
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift reporting restrictions to promote transparency and development have not been achieved .	-3.6879
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report back from Indonesia ’ s worrying eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a declaration .	-3.7825
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbours .	-13.2656
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to examine the ' different and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai Shooting .	-3.7663
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-0.8246
The speaker of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group ’ s accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia , there is still a democratic system and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.5360
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.6776

Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua says that it is unlikely to vote again for Jokowi .	-16.4273
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people who are involved in the paniai shots , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal Council .	-4.3517
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor educational and health services .	-3.0757
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , consider their voice to Jokowi as a " guilt " that he must pay back .	-3.1585
" You don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-9.8190
Despite the threats and intimidation , the families of the Paniai shot victims led to a final symbolic act of the notion : the body of a victim was buried on a terrain precisely against the police and the military station .	-5.7306

Fire captures Dubai ’ s Torch ’ s Scratcher for the second time in C. , in the , .	-13.5662
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai , forcing hundreds of inhabitants to flee from 337 metres high , 79-storey buildings .	-4.6058
It is the second fire caught in just two years by the high house , which , accidentally , is called the Torch Tower ( F) .	-5.2214
The building was evacuated , no injuries were reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.6874
" We slept and we found ourselves in the fire alarm and in the cries of the people .	-4.1016
We ran the stairs down , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " told a resident who gave his name to George .	-3.8574
Dubai 's civil protection authorities said that the units of fire fighting against 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 p.m. GMT ) deleted the fire and cooled the building .	-3.7288
The government said it was working to provide accommodation for those affected .	-3.1630
The incident may revive questions about the safety of materials used in external areas of high-houses around the world .	-3.6356
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage occurred from clothing , external clothing to decoration or isolation .	-4.2106
In the UK , the police said that they believe that the system of plates for isolation and clothing on the London Grenfell tower in June could contribute to the rapid spread of a fire that killed about 80 people .	-4.2663

The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has met with his great Davis Cup coup at the General Assembly .	-3.2990
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary to play Davis Cup individuals only on two pay rates was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-4.5107
Thus , the five-sentence classics , which are often very long but also very valued , remain the traditional competition .	-19.8351
63.54 % of the Member States voted in favour of reform , and the ITF President David Haggerty ’ s target was thus barely missed .	-3.9029
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our members have not adopted the whole Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package .	-2.7123
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical competitions , " said Haggerty .	-2.1735
We will continue to work on improving the application .	-2.4550
Not until the vote after many claims had already arrived before the proposal to put the final in a neutral place .	-4.4896
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host law in the following year in the first roun.	-4.5240

More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring forbidden objects to the aircraft , find out a survey .	-4.2062
A air passenger survey showed that more than 20 % were aware of or unconsciously prohibited objects at the US Transportation Security Administration ’ s control points , including at least 6 % of the aircraft entering the aircraft , while accidentally carrying forbidden blades or other items .	-6.7774
Less than 1 % claimed that they were late to discover that they were mistaken with guns , ammunition , or explosive .	-3.8672
The survey of more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers fail to respect the rules .	-3.7761
Of those respondents who admittedly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % were Millennials , compared to less than 15 % members of the generation X.	-3.5735
The most common objects intentionally pre-cipitated with TSA agents were food and liquids .	-3.7968
More than 3 % gave items knowingly worn by security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male surveys also confirmed that they had deliberately brought forbidden drugs to the aircraft .	-4.0506
The company said that it has consulted travellers across the country to find out how many accidentally had brought smuggling goods through airport security and how many had done it intentionally .	-14.1694
It is no surprise that the people who are the best smuggling ware - knowledgeable or unknowledgeable - bear the safety of those who fly most often .	-5.3889
However , the company indicates that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-11.9439
People are often unsure what liquids they are allowed to take or how much of it is .	-15.1618
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confiscated by the TSA are prohibited .	-3.2953
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling ware .	-3.0103
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights but not on international flights .	-1.1982
Elon Musk doesn 't matter : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel order orders by .	-11.9153
Electro-thousand sassa Elon Musk will be happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.5251
He has so far underestimated that some of the customers have withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-3.9484
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla ’ s chief Elon Musk , in announcing the recent quarterly balance , has betrayed a different , less glossy number for the first time : that of cancellations to the new mass market model 3 .	-6.5737
Musk has frequently advertised over the past few months with more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .	-4.6085
Now Musk admits : 63,000 have already been withdrawn from a total of 518,000 orders .	-4.4242
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that it is only non-binding reservations .	-3.3737
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1000 euros ( $ 1000 in the UK and $ 1000 in the UK ) entirely back .	-5.6849
Currently , 455,000 such noncommittal reservations , cleared musk in a telephone conference with analysts .	-4.0333
However , the Tesla chief does not believe that the cancellation of up to now could become a problem of about 12 % of all orders .	-4.6736
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but on the production side .	-2.5668
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.2085
In 2018 , all models are to be 500,000 , a million in 2020 .	-3.7216
The demand for this is obvious .	-3.0221
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.3803
If you order a " model 3 " today , you can count on delivery at the earliest time in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to travel its brand new production roads that are never tested in practice without any major interruptions with maximum utilisation .	-6.1707
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4041
But if there is a bigger delay , then the noncommitment of reservations to the problem of Tesla could become .	-3.8476
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running out in harsh areas .	-4.2403
EPA leader Pruitt is pulling back for delaying Obama ’ s rules to reduce emissions .	-3.5858
One day after he was sued by 15 countries , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Authority , resigned his previous decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions smog of pollutants that cause it .	-4.0752
Pruitt presented change when his agency proved to be more responsive to the needs of the public environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.6623
He did not mention the claim against his previous post in a German Appeals Court .	-3.6550
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the standards of 2015 for nearby ozone .	-3.7550
Pruit announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give its authority more time , study and avoid interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth .	-3.5449
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental legislation .	-3.1613
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruit has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that chemical industry and fossil fuels industry oppose .	-16.0803
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.1821
Last month , a German Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama administration rule obliging oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanlecs .	-3.4093
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his turning of ozone standards simply strengthen EPA 's willingness to cooperate with states by the complex process of meeting new standards in time .	-3.7633
" Under previous administrations , the EPA often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged with activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the implementation deadline , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-15.1910
" We do not believe in judicial regulation , and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.0462
We also take the law and the authority that exists to us seriously . '	-2.1694
Nevertheless , the EPA statement stated that at some point , Pruitt will use its ' delay power and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on sound policies and the best available information ' .	-20.5857
Congress Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of ozone rules .	-2.0206
A draft legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the rules of 2015 by at least eight years .	-12.9673
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.2117
The New York General Prosecutor Eric Schneiderman , who headed the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.4068
" The reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important benefit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans who are directly affected by the smog that flows to their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-4.4579
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington and the District of Columbia .	-1.9562
Both ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemicals and other sources in the atmosphere respond to sunlight .	-3.3633
The emerging smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups and contribute every year to thousands of premature deaths .	-2.4939
Public health officials and environmentalists rejoiced Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-3.8171
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to take this sensible step from those responsible for protecting the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd from the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.2203

According to the document ’ s text , on the Tumlinger Mountain , apart from the former parish church , a magnificent courtyard belonging to the church or the right to patronage was not reversed .	-6.6915
So people lived there too .	-1.1840
As evidenced by the description of the Oberamte Freudenstadt of 1858 , besides the subdorf and the Oberdorf , which are still to be seen today in the village image of Tumlingen , the " mountain " of the third , the dominant settlement of the village .	-5.6313
Old cards from the time around 1600 reinforce these historical realities .	-3.3769
The patronage law was derived from the early Medieval ownership law .	-5.0150
A Lord who built a church , equipped and occupied with a parish , remained the owner of this church and could also inherit this own church .	-3.8924
The right to apply a parish or to propose a new parish to the bishop .	-4.2099
Three altars existed in the church and two bells on the tower .	-1.7117
The sizes of the two tormented at Christmas in 1673 .	-3.3757
The newly acquired bells took place in 1692 for the first time , but later had to be given in 1942 in the Second World War .	-4.5720
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) , the window panels were cut and the bell stole was stolen .	-12.4361
The room was clean and comfortable .	-4.7372
In 1796 , French troops came close to the church .	-1.8234
They broke the fire and church chairs and used them as burning wood .	-3.2913
The remains of the church threatened to fall in 1809 .	-2.1237
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius-Friedhof also served as the last rest place for the dead from the hearing swept .	-4.9818
In 1823 the graveyard was extended and the Hilarius Church abandoned .	-2.5609
Only one allowed the church tower to stand .	-2.1360
In the New Year 's Night in 1834 , a storm divided the church tower and half fallen .	-2.9766
To avoid an accident , the tower was abandoned .	-2.2079
Only the tower that still exists today remained as a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-3.9832
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius facility from the " Schaffigen Pensioners " as successor to Dieter Dockhorn .	-4.1387
As organisers , friends and promoters invite Tumlingens to the sixth serenade on the old graveyard to the St. Hilarius chapel on Sunday 16 July .	-4.5164
It is designed by the Kepler Gymnasium Freudenstadt Combo and with speeches by Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-3.2108
Local leader Hartmut Romann speaks the keyword .	-1.8128
The program starts at 6.30 p.m.	-1.7833
Open from 3 p.m.	-3.1172
A Umtrunk takes place to the conclusion of the serenade in front of the graveyard .	-3.6872
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shadow of old trees and with a broad view over meadows to the forest " , the organizers show fantastic views .	-4.3281
The servade takes place only in dry weather .	-3.8455
The organisers look forward to receiving many supporters for the historical St. Hilarius facility , which is important for tumlings and hearing silences .	-5.7504
The friends and conveyors of Tumlingens feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade Organizer Walter Martini reaffirms .	-17.0610
Association wants to have authorisation of wind wheels checked .	-4.1399
" Boisheim defends itself " does not see a legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the council .	-4.1226
The association " Boisheim is defending itself " has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its authorization for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim net .	-4.8132
It was unlawful .	-3.1608
The Association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind power plants could have been authorised at the Boisheimer Nette , since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at Schwalmtal .	-4.6076
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind power plants are basically possible , while at the same time the concentration zone makes the concentration zone an exclusion of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-5.6172
Their zones are designed to prevent " savings " from the landscape .	-4.3633
Although the city of Viersen decided a second wind concentration zone in the Nette of Boisheimer , just a few days before , by changing the area utilization plan , which was not approved by the district government of Düsseldorf because of a formal error .	-7.2079
" Due to the lack of a planning precondition , the authorization model is still illegal and therefore to withdraw " , Christoph Erkens , Chairman of " Boisheim is defending itself " .	-5.8651
The current state of affairs : before the summer recess the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette has once again decided on ; approval of the district government is still available .	-6.9609
My final point is : ' This means granting permission for the construction of wind power plants ' .	-5.4128
The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .	-2.2643
" The corresponding letters have been listed at the district of Viersen last week " , explained a speaker .	-4.3795
The circle makes it an opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-3.3620
It is likely , however , that they do not stop the procedure .	-13.2251
In view of current procedures at the administrative court , the circle on Thursday did not wish to express its views on the argument of the association " Boisheim defends itself " .	-4.9682
NEW Re , a subsidiary of NEW , plans to build four wind turbines on an area on the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.1140
Last year the company in which the city of Viersen is directly involved had signed pacht contracts with the owner of the 65 hectares large terrain .	-4.1917
Establishing the four wind energy plants , electricity demands can be met by approximately 11 400 households - equivalent to a fifth of the electricity requirement of all four households .	-5.6189
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.0758
Last summer , Viersen ’ s city council gave the green light to buy three wind turbine plants at Linnich near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind power plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the district of Heinsberg .	-4.3824

These include new offers such as the first " Aktiv-Day " to the Brunnenfest along with sold sold Sunday , conversations with all traders and hosts to move them to active participation .	-4.8449
Also attractive offers on Saturday and parking fees on this day are part of the concept .	-3.2932
In addition , customer potentials are to be re-opened or explored again .	-12.3852
These include guests and tourists .	-2.4415
But many locals would have lost sight of the city when shopping .	-3.0882
In the end , everyone would have to help to invigorate the city centre - to rent , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .	-6.3441
King said in spring that the lethargy had been spreading with a network .	-4.2728
Birgit String , Director of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen announced that five Thuringian cities participate in the third day of the federal states ' home shops ' -tag .	-6.2227
Besides Bad Langensalza , Weimar , Sömmerda , Saint City and Bleicherode are the main tourist attractions .	-5.5354
The day should " promote the value of local trade and emphasize its importance to the common good of our cities , " says Strick .	-4.6437
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also demonstrates that each citizen can influence his / her purchasing behaviour directly .	-4.3892

Trump , after leaked transcripts of telephone calls from Mexico , pressured for payment of the border wall .	-3.7997
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-1.7971
On 27 January , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump asked to stop telling publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.2050
The US President imprisoned him for denouncing the wall publicly , according to reports he said : ' You cannot say this to the press . '	-4.9247
Trump launched his presidential campaign with a promise to build a wall on the US ’ s southern border , and swore to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.0782
Transcripts of his first call with the Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and unveiled a tense exchange .	-2.6499
Mr. Trump said that a trade for the US migrants to Australia would be ' ridiculous ' , ' miss ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence of trade brought forward by the Obama administration would appear like a ' dep ' after proposing a ban on resettlement of refugees to the US . in the . the was in the , in , , by .	-17.3194

Moore Ford massacres : activists revive racist lynchaff as a call for justice .	-4.7087
A 1948 Ford Mercury moved through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumbled to the Moore ford bridge .	-3.8114
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , a group of white men arose with guns to block his way .	-3.0427
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train to his cigar and looked temporarily through the windscreen .	-4.5315
Drink floated the occupants in fear .	-2.8142
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " the man broken .	-3.1826
'Get him from the car ! '	-2.1045
Shrew torn the silence when a young black man was distorted by the front-passenger seat .	-3.2306
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just a reference .	-13.0993
But if a snake is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the public would see very real sights .	-4.9936
Since 2005 , civil rights came back to Moore 's Ford Bridge to pick up the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were gelynched by Klux Klan in 1946 .	-4.5548
Nobody has ever been charged with the murder .	-1.8129
" It is really inconceivable that in all these years not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are " , Tyrone Brooks , who helps organize the post .	-4.6058
" It is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.1770
Brooks is a 71-year-old congressional member of the State of Georgia and civil rights lawyers for a life .	-4.0172
It serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual memory to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.6236
" We want criminal prosecution , we want the end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , " he said .	-3.0338
'We cannot achieve cure and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-10.7063
A court medicine places a bed sheet on the body of one of the victims of the Moore-Ford lynches on 27 July 1946 .	-3.5877
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected of in the lynch process .	-3.1420
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.7906
Although the suspects have remained on a free foot for decades , civil rights say that double motivation for lynch actions has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .	-5.1817
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court enabled the black citizens of Georgia to vote in the pre-election campaign in the summer .	-2.8592
About the same time as the election , according to the FBI of the black colormaster Roger Malcom , a white property , Barnett Hester , during a fight , supposedly because of a woman .	-4.9378
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy , and that the baby she carried was not from her husband .	-3.5462
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-18.9142
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey as prison .	-1.8978
But when they removed from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-4.0073
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-2.5641
" It is also obvious that there was a complete between public and local criminal prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered the identity of witnesses " . in , in , in , in . , in , in , in ,	-14.1254
Brooks worded it even more concise .	-2.5082
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said . , .	-11.5549
" You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and vote , then that will happen to you here . '	-3.9918
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene managed the annual posting of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch Mord .	-3.9275
Their presentation is illustrating , taking , and is based in a kind of deep racism that many want to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-4.9352
It is hard to watch and more difficult to look away , but Greene said that this is the point .	-12.9187
" We do not want to talk about the lynch , because we are confronted with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-3.5425
" But I can not build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.1612
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest black - were pushing into a room and listening when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece .	-4.4556
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes co-director .	-1.3599
He has played the role of the head clan member for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-2.5934
" I feel dirty because I am not so much , " said Marbaugh .	-1.7196
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times ' .	-2.9497
On the other side of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tested their lines .	-2.9119
The piece begins with Malcom , who attacks and pushes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.1720
" I said n -- he , disappear from my property ! "	-1.8570
Rascona returns the fire .	-1.6722
There is a break .	-0.7517
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) appears in laughter .	-3.7603
Greene laughs the worst .	-1.9664
" What ? " asked Rascona .	-1.1799
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.9302
Was I too hard ?	-0.6733
" No , " Greene said , still kicking .	-2.0345
" I simply do not believe that white people then 'n --- he ' said .	-3.7408
" But " , " one of the other black actors .	-2.8810
'You just have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-1.9627
And that is precisely where energy shifts in space , a sense of camera replaces the unease .	-3.3055
Everyone is concerned with getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four killed people .	-3.1482
The scene begins again .	-1.3459
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and emphatically .	-2.3498
Nobody is laughing .	-1.5130
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.8501
There are shries , shots and then silence .	-1.7581
A woman clothed with sadness , stands above the corpses of the actor and performs Billie Holidays ’ sad lobby " Strange Fruit " .	-5.9392
Your vote breaks each second word .	-2.0681
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators blows welding and tears from the eyes .	-3.6659
The audience is divided almost evenly between black and white .	-1.7731
A pair is coming from Ithaca , New York , to see the show , many come down only the road .	-2.8259
They have witnessed Georgia ’ s impressive humidity almost every eight hours when brooks lead them to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage .	-5.6572
Until that point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now when you stand on the same land where the murders took place , the air feels sparsely .	-5.3473
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites you to get closer and inspect the body name .	-3.9654
Children hock on their heads , register fake blood and silent body and whisper each other .	-3.2183
" They are not really dead " , murdering a small boy , as if he wanted to remember them .	-3.9246
After a few minutes thanks Greene the quantity - and suddenly it is over .	-1.6676
The actors discard the lynchseil and dismantle their tears .	-3.9349
Bradshaw surrounds Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-2.8255
Nick Rascona surrounds two of his fellow players and then breaks together into her arms , the emotional burden of performance eventually breaks through with him .	-5.2430
" It is okay " , winds one of the women .	-3.1130
" We know that this is not your heart .	-1.4925
You did so for one reason . '	-2.1890
Later the audience meets with the actors for dinner .	-2.8107
At a table , a white couple of Atlanta suggests the posting with a black couple that they have just met .	-5.0580
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the show .	-3.0103
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you , " she said .	-15.9395
" What this really does with me makes me believe that the lynche is still going on , " she added , " today it is called only police shooting . "	-5.8931
In the same space , Tyrone Brooks Hof holds his table , eats and reminds of civil rights .	-3.0738
He said he had already begun to plan the performance next year .	-2.2264
" The posting is in a way inspiring , because it describes the horrors of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.3774
" It 's so if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-2.5640
Anyone who does not study their own history is condemned to repeat it . '	-3.0883
" God Dawn " reconciled the Wagnerians in Bayreuth	-2.2175
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner 's monumental work , director Frank Castorf also places on a bunt-frivole staging against gigantic , sixthy scenes .	-4.5582
The rotary stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) optionally shows a shabby road corner , including wall rest and dönerbude in Berlin , a " plastic and elastic " logo from DDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-4.4170
Before that , an open Mercedes-Oldtimer where the Rhine daughters are positioned as rockergerls , or an Isetta .	-5.1254
Stacked oil barrels remind Castorf 's Leitmotif - Money , Power and Gier - which is drawn by its " ring " staging .	-4.4295

Brutal the scene when he hits Siegfried .	-2.0534
Later Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must also believe in this .	-2.9648
The audience thanks it to the ensemble with a strong applause .	-3.0343
Stormically celebrated are Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski , who is modest and shaped the hands of the Merkel skin .	-4.3454
There is a big applause for the festival orchestra , which shows for the first time on stage - given the great heat again in empty leisure clothing .	-4.5241
It was with tension that the appearance of Frank Castorf and his registry team was awaited .	-4.1822
Had he had to let a gleaming pipe concert surround himself in 2013 , there were five years later , in which the single " Buh " reputation was lost .	-6.2467
Head of Festival Katharina Wagner should have been pleased about this .	-3.3475
" One realizes that the audience has grown together with the " ring " in a way , " she just said before the dpa was performed .	-4.6012
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf , it was also an understanding of its view .	-14.8807

The administration and the majority of the county hosts such a Community space as not just a meeting place for the people of senior residence but openly enter the community .	-7.7195

There is a planet trail in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.7481
A " star trail " came in front of the information needs of many medical visitors , it was said .	-4.7473
It combines nature , science , movement and sports performance .	-1.5744
Members want to be established along the planned route panels and inform about stars and constellations .	-4.7727
In a first phase until 2018 the association plans " well accessible installations in five to six places " in the upper rescue .	-4.0472
Inquiries would come from St. Andreasberg , Brunlage , Hohegeische and Sieber .	-14.0264
The information on the boards should be supplemented by the Internet .	-2.9022
Therefore , a good mobile network receipt plays a role in selecting location .	-4.1579
Freedom of accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.4250
The train will be extended later on .	-2.8229
" On the star path the viewers learn a lot of knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars " , the association explained .	-4.4154
Moreover , they learned why stars had different colors , or why a star lighted stronger than another , although they were much further away .	-4.9237

The steels with each planet - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are set precisely at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-4.4986
The Earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetre diameter , while the exactly 75 meters away sun is still measuring 70 centimetres .	-14.0406
The entire distance of the planet route is four kilometres .	-3.1288
While the light of the sun takes about eight hours to the pluto , pedestrians need a good hour to the steel with pluto .	-3.9258

Fortunas Hoffmann : " Triple chain works better " .	-1.7097
Andre Hoffmann hopes for Braunschweig 's optimization of defense in Aue Points after 2 : 2 .	-4.2233
The first season game was satisfied with Andre Hoffmann , with the result as well , would not have been the two opponents at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-4.4187
" These were two opponents too much , and we need to keep a close eye on our eyes , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-4.1328
In the Erzgebirge , the three-range range range is to be further optimized .	-3.5010
And a gate for a free slaughter doesn 't want to capture the fortunes either .	-4.9406
" For the future , there will be no more Michael ( Rensing ) on the line . "	-14.0880
Hoffmann is convinced that his team is better able to cope with the triple chain than with the fourth chain even after his experience .	-5.6155
" I still do not know how to act in Aue , " says his coach Friedhelm Runkel , but Hoffmann is sure himself , " because we have half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can construct well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.2370
'It is essential , but that we harmonise even better and we do not afford so many playing errors in the construction process ' .	-4.9892
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.3408
" But if you can speak of a failed start after a decision , don 't know .	-3.2442
The achievement could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-2.3102
" If we have four points on Sunday and we can concentrate on the pool , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper season break . "	-5.5233
He did not want to know anything about this .	-3.1539
" I judge the start in the season only after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage to Aue , just because the game of the Saxons in Heidenheim had to be abandoned prematurely because of a weather .	-5.2829
" Now they can begin the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believes that players from Aue might be even more fresh as they would not have a difficult and complete game such as Fortuna against a rise favorite in the bones .	-5.8137
" But they don 't know so 100-percent where they stand at the moment " says the interior defender of Fortuna .	-3.2993
Although guests from the Rhineland go to the encounter in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday .	-4.2519
" That we discard them , just because we are entitled to get under the first six , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive when it comes to defeating eyes from nine games .	-5.6107
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that must be beaten from the outset , " explains Fortunas Chefcoach .	-3.8542
'Such a statement would be arrogant and substantial ' .	-2.3444
This is how Funkel will no longer witness his players on Sunday .	-13.0362
Results of Swedish asylum evaluation tests	-1.6720
The recent results of the tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , subject to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.3271
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority has begun to carry out the tests last year .	-2.9073
They are supposed to make an assessment of age more precisely during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration scale ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-5.4429
Until today , migration verb has sent 6.880 cases to test and the Forensic Medicine Agency has released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the mid-March period to 31 July 2017 .	-4.4849
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases , the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was possibly 18 years or older .	-3.0520
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under 18 years old " .	-2.3033
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-2.1389
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-3.2511
" We do not see a big difference in statistics over the past few months , the figures are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.4434
The large proportion of cases where the person was judged for more than 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied above his age .	-13.7277
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that ' suggest that the investigated person is 18 years or older ' .	-3.0220
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published , she noticed that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that it would be 18 years old this year .	-3.9887
The method of medical retirement , in which X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRT images of knee joints are made , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-4.9720
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see if they went earlier or later than usually through the puberty .	-4.2854
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.2230
Evaluating biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.2949
If we cannot say it safely , we should not do as if we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-3.1368
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of assessing a child as an adult is low .	-3.6377
The biggest risk is that if the person is less than 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.0268

The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s World Record Transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-15.3855
Any consequences will be reached by UEFA in Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that monitored the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-4.5093

In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on clubs ’ debt to monitoring their losses .	-1.9683
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand , should become a tougher issue .	-3.9958
During the current three-year FFP investment period that runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-2.7381
And , although Platini ’ s presidency has fallen badly in 2015 , his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to advocate excessive expenditure .	-4.9762

But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become World Championship ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre for UEFA regulatory authorities could be eas.	-3.9432
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to bypass the rules .	-13.8185
UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG on Neymar 's transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-3.0335
You spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.8811

Two people were arrested for similar racies in Italy .	-2.9092
There were German arrest warrants against the two Italians .	-2.0871
The two are therefore probably delivered to Germany .	-2.3365
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-1.2375
In total , over 300 police officers were in use .	-1.9817
Mafia members are accused of organized drug crime , severe acts of violence , attempted murder , as well as room and blackmail .	-3.9243
Since the summer of 2016 , the Public Prosecutor has been determining Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in the southern German region .	-4.1128
Between the prosecutors in Constance and Palermo there was a heated exchange , and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-12.1793
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , the grand use was accompanied by four officials from Palermo .	-2.9638
On the basis of the studies , Italian citizens were mostly referring closely to the Italian mafia .	-4.8543
Also an incident on May 27 , in the hills where several shots were fired in the morning in a restaurant , is likely to go to the band 's account .	-4.8274
Large gaps in the foreign register complain about this .	-3.0516
" Citizens ' data should not arise here : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-3.9669
This leads to partly serious misdecisions in asylum procedures .	-2.8980
The Federal Government ’ s Representative for Refugee Management , Frank-Jürgen Weirgen , has drawn attention to a media report of large gaps in the central register of foreign-central registers .	-4.1016
Shortcomings in the data registered could lead to ' partially serious misdecisions ' in the case of asylum procedures and deportations , warning in an analysis of the ' Southern German newspaper ' .	-4.8939
According to the register , ten million people are listed with foreign nationality , including around 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.7479
The data will therefore be managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.2059
Because data has not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of data has not been good in parts .	-3.3794
In individual cases , data had been found from 1921 , ' from people who have long since ceased to live , or from citizens who have become German citizens and who really should not appear in the register ' .	-5.1915
'Error data input may slow return processes considerably , ' it continues to say ' .	-4.2921
Moreover , statistics on people who are obliged to travel are EU citizens who do not need to leave .	-4.4252
Such misguided assignments , however , led to ' a distorted debate on how to deal with exit obligations ' , meaning in the analysis .	-4.5413
Meanwhile , the Federal Government seems to have begun to send refugee families with under 16 years of age children back to Italy when they have arrived .	-4.0660
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , the newspaper reports .	-3.4393
The paper therefore states that BAMF has returned to Italy since 1 June 2017 to " families with children , with the exception of infants and young children .	-4.5118
This has virtually no longer been possible since the end of 2014 , and the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.1308
According to the Dublin Agreement , EU refugees are responsible for first achieving them .	-3.8264
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state can return him to the immigrant country .	-4.6294
The explanatory statement now states that ' capacity for families with under-age children in Italy has increased substantially ' .	-4.0818
Italy has provided guarantees for the accommodation and accommodation of families .	-2.5656
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECMR ) considers these commitments sufficient .	-1.8339
Other EU countries , too , would send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.2959
The internal political spokesperson of the left-wing left , Ulla Yelpke , criticised this decision : ' Families with children are threatened by the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system of human rights absorption conditions and a threat to child wellbeing ' .	-13.6854
The Second Best Resolution	-5.7693
In total , 220 litres of blood from people living in Oberreichenbach already provided blood donation for other people .	-2.8909
At least the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .	-2.0882
Along the way , Jürgen Greule , who shared blood with his now 100 donations , now 50 litres of bl.	-5.2321
Traditionally , at the meeting of the municipality , the municipality appreciates the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-3.8575
" It is great how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors who provide their blood for foreigners , even less self-serving , " underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.5454
" A single donation helps several people , " explained by the Red Cross Head of the Deutsche Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the Conserves are being displaced into their components .	-5.4630
Three people could already benefit from blood donation .	-2.1134
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions undertaken in Oberreichenbach in spring .	-2.7330
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK Circle Head .	-3.5676
Obviously , just a few years ago , the switch to the theatre house led to higher numbers of participants .	-3.4953
Even before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer were among the multiple donors and were awarded for each 50 blood donations .	-3.4346
Half so many people Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll , and Uwe Vetter spent ten times each 500 billion of their life-juice .	-4.5662
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 % .	-1.3462
The Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakened have dampened speculation over an increase .	-4.1784
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " bearing " when it maintains interest rates on family income in an intensifying pressure .	-3.6533
Monetary Committee ’ s policymakers ( MPC ) voted to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking a rise this month , because weak economic growth has weakened support for increased .	-4.6166
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation likely to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-2.9061
But it signalled that , in the next few years , raising interest rates would be needed to reach Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , and said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.5912
Members also voted for withdrawing part of the Mammot stimulus package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-3.2982
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has now been said that it is expected to provide 15 billion more pounds under this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling .	-4.8368
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " The gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as household real incomes continue to put pressure on consumption . "	-4.2654
On interest rates , it reiterated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' scale than markets expect .	-3.4039
Markets are currently predicting the first increase in next year ’ s third quarter and another in 2020 .	-2.8102
The Bank , however , stressed that increases would be ' gradually ' and ' limited ' .	-11.4627
The Bank ’ s downward corrected growth forecasts for this year and next year are compared to the 1.9 % projected in May and 1.7 % .	-2.7549
It maintained its growth prediction to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.5934
The pound fell vis-à-vis the dollar and the euro .	-1.9379
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to 1.11 euros .	-1.9216
No change is made after recent disappointing growth figures have reduced rising expectations for an interest rate hike , and GDP has risen to 0.2 % in the second quarter of the past three months to 0.3 % .	-5.2048
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will be easy to recover from the end of the year after the bank .	-3.3127
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low pay increases , as the exacerbation will only get worse before it gets better .	-4.4453
It added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income slump in the next few years , " but it added that wages will " clearly " recover at the end of their three-year forecasts .	-3.9114
The economy will also be strengthened by the rise in demand for British goods , due to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-3.1256
The decision will come one year after the drop in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-2.8151
The Bank estimates that it will likely take four years to achieve complete prices and the economy .	-3.0980
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .	-3.9245
Last month , inflation dropped from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said that this was expected and it will resume in the coming months .	-3.5135
The Bank said that the excess ratio to its 2 % target is ' to the weak pound ' .	-3.6699
Andrew Montlake , Director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in the swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , because lenders want to look loudly for business and end the year positively .	-15.5132
The market looks particularly good for those who run the deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-4.9064
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is meant to prescribe 10,000 disputed HIV drugs for people who are prescribiwith dispute HIV dr.	-5.5270
Patients will receive access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a struggle before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in NHS .	-3.5061
NHS England announced that pre-exposure prophylaxes ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , are now supplied by the health service over a first three-year study for an estimated 10,000 people .	-4.5056
He declared his willingness to finance the process after last year 's Court of Appeals confirmed a judgment by the Supreme Court of Justice that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.0601
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) described this as " decisive moment " .	-3.3114
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October , before introducing it throughout England in April 2018 .	-3.5349
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.5632
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission to infectious people .	-2.3083
Taking PrEP before sexual traffic means that there are enough medicines in the body of one person to prevent HIV infection .	-3.8070
Such drugs can be taken every day or two hours before gender traffic .	-3.1283
Those who question the treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and persons with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.2286
Suitable participants are identified in clinics , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.1282
People living in England and registered with a house doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-3.6033
The program will <unk> 10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of medicines this week after an international competitive purchase .	-3.3147
The study is intended to judge the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as targeted , taken and implemented on a large scale .	-4.1997
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.3733
It is another milestone in the ongoing progress of more than three decades in tackling one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . '	-3.9220
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.9370
PrEP , if it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people , offers the possibility of changing the English HIV epidemic .	-3.5262
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly controlled individually and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .	-4.3616
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-0.9377
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is conducted quickly throughout the country and that nobody who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-3.5552
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the best path to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-3.1120
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and delay in implementation by the government .	-2.8031
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this vibrant infection .	-2.9444
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-1.9161
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible in the whole country to protect people infected with HIV and that it will help us to bring about a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society .	-13.3857
The great life : intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned these small Earls Court apartments into a generous home .	-4.9749
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , shrinked from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court apartment in 2014 .	-2.9938
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold its pockets .	-2.5971
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space , " says Joanne .	-2.2194
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-1.8298
This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.0446
I loved them and made an offer on that day " .	-2.3332
Since its first visit , the 1,000 square feet of apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.4989
Originally a one-room establishment with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne Staurum and an intermediate floor to optimally use the spacious ceiling height .	-4.9881
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.5783
That was my request , " she says .	-2.0378
For this purpose , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed from Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and to create a home that was not only a development but also a place to life for Joanne .	-3.9606
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could stand .	-3.6066
First had to think creatively to solve the requirement .	-2.7272
" The steel work is quite complicated " , he explains .	-2.3662
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked together without having to bite .	-4.2690
The aim was not only to build a simple platform , but to create the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or down ' .	-4.4448
This arrangement enabled the foundation to place two spaces in full - with a lot of additional drama .	-4.9673
For the interior floor , a classic copper window of retrouvius overlooks the glamorous living area .	-3.9704
Gold furniture mirrored , silver accents and vintage Serge Mouille Lighting set the style for the program .	-2.1773
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .	-1.8141
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to let him work longer .	-3.7866
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.6953
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all tails and glasses of Joanne .	-2.9920
By perceiving a more glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-2.5105
Toggeable kitchens are nothing new .	-3.1216
The particular thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.1103
" A little engineering art went into it , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced , furnished MDF door .	-3.4355
" It 's weight , so if you push the door up , it 's very easy to slip . "	-4.7975
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-17.5769
" At the end of the day you will sell the ground area - or how your property will be appreciated " , says Erfan.	-2.9643
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate broker will occur and a calculation based on the size of the ground . " the the .	-13.0040
Here they managed to enlarge the ground and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-5.5691
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional link in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.0985
" You don 't lose your electric power outlets in the walls .	-3.4336
These are important , but they do not play with your heart ' .	-1.6249
It shows that an apartment can transform through good design and increased square meters of something by default into something very astonishing .	-3.7830
Indeed , as Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-2.3393
Brothers are fighting for a US $ 500 million imperial real estate .	-3.4069
Two brothers are in four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a confrontation about one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate imperies , worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.9752
The former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be divided .	-3.8925
Paul wanted to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp discussion about separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-3.3334
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have had 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-2.8536
The Westco Jeans family founded it and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.3179
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .	-1.1435
This money has been invested in real estate , and De Lutis 's portfolio now includes offices in the city rum , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , as well as shopping centres in the suburbs .	-3.9723
Following an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - has about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul about one-third .	-4.5699
A court says that this means that Colin has $ 316 million worth of Colin and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-3.6254
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.3443
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him behind what I thought was for the best objects " , he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-3.3975
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-1.8137
The brothers are now fighting for control of the existing business - Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled out it .	-17.5214
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently .	-2.8667
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-2.4871
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the most important priority " , he wrote .	-2.1025
The cost will rise in the case , with hundreds of pages with affidavits , e-mails and reports from companies , including Deloite , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and the law firms held by both sides .	-4.7906
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.1666
They used the security to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first shop of the family .	-2.4070
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was " in my last years of high school , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-13.4204
Anna De Lutis says she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property well on to their sons .	-2.2988
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-1.9915
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , with Colin arguing that when leaving the company , $ 10 million and Luke were paid $ 26 million .	-3.5073
Paul says that both Lukas and Mark have become bitter about the terms of their financial separation .	-3.6032
Colin was a former member of the Executive Board of AFL and after a biography of 2015 by Eddie McGuire the best friend of the TV star .	-4.8414
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.4139
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really can not say much , " because the case is before the courts .	-3.0531
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and to draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.8090
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.4144
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I would end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he ' still hopes for a solution ' .	-3.1946
On Friday , this hope seemed over .	-2.1414

Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the president ’ s media abstinence . with the .	-12.1321
Others tried and failed .	-1.1917
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do it .	-1.8304
If so , he will be the first .	-0.9326
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new Chief of Staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including the news media reports , in the hope of keeping the head on an even path .	-3.7108
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.0919
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff met with senior employees on his first day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that gets into the president ’ s hands .	-4.1158
Kelly said to employees that information should be passed on to him , whether on paper or in Briefing , because the President would make better decisions if he were to receive good information . "	-4.7007
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media .	-1.5205
President Trump ’ s relationship with television dates back decades , and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.5411
" When Trump was angry for an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from jobs that were to be persuaded , " said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg , to Politico in February .	-4.4756
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keeping Trump ’ s twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a constant lobby price . '	-3.7801
Okay .	-0.5232
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever " under control " is ridiculous .	-1.8906
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained more ignition without their interventions .	-3.5757
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.3021
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble some times , then their efforts were worthwhile .	-4.2185
But no one has been consistent in preventing Trump from causing controversy .	-2.6037
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that possibly promotes their views from the world .	-3.3619
Politico , dealing with this history , reported in May the consultants ’ preference to give dubious information to the President for strategic reasons .	-4.3362
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmakers :	-1.7903
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is defiant to where they come from .	-4.0541
This is exactly what happened at the end of February when someone accused the president of being a printed copy of an article by GottNews.com , the website of the Internet provocator Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a bunch of Lecks " in the White House .	-4.3496
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment or has not offered any concrete evidence or has been expressing false accusations in the past and revoking them .	-4.3793
Trump read the article and began to ask staff about Walsh . "	-2.5453
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reinc Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram received Trump . "	-3.6128
How did this fall ?	-1.4236
Kelly attempts to do the same three months later .	-1.7386
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager than a prieboo , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still striving for influence .	-4.1372
These unchanged factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.6649
Europol ’ s Mastestimated Criminals Get Post	-4.2528

Travellers negotiate on a ditch and return to the ' Millionary series ' .	-3.0196
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are again standing with some determined travellers at war foot , who negotiated a tomb drawn by the community to demand a field back in front of their manor houses .	-5.9898
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , which is called the " Millionairs series " .	-3.9778
They have brought horses , babies , and an army of transporters after they were discarded in May , without being discouraged by the Council to prevent their accidents .	-6.1610
The tactious group found a gap in defense facilities and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-3.9880
Ancient inhabitants have pressed the Council of Solihull , who said that ' it is useless to address the problem ' .	-4.8062
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they thrown stones on the passers-by .	-3.8435
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.1435
The travelers were there in May , were moved further and are now back .	-2.8823
More was added yesterday evening , probably even more today ' .	-12.6005

To support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour with the police by calling 101 .	-2.9994

The house in front of the gates of the city will be renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.6149
Good news for the city .	-1.7432
Because , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on April 13 , 2014 , around 30 000 nights were lost each year and income from the Kurtaxes .	-5.2234
In the autumn of 2014 , in view of the dramatically increasing numbers of refugees arriving in the county , the hotel building was offered to the Land Council as a collection of accommodation , causing controversial discussions .	-5.4514
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-3.5186
At that time the decision was not undisputed in the councillor .	-3.3443
But above all , Freudenstadt ’ s Oberbürgermeister Julian Oswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interest in the house as early as then .	-5.1426
He should be right .	-1.3039
The group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and intends to return to a House of Three Star Plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-12.1671
The group has four houses with the city of Freudenurt .	-13.8247
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-14.7624
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-2.3329
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the house for a long time , and when you enter the house it is clear what extensive renovations are being carried out .	-5.7695
The floors have been cleaned , partially decorated ceilings , removed old bathtubs from the rooms .	-3.9415
The entire hotel is a single building .	-2.1113

You don 't want to position yourself on the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but already at a high inner city level , Scherer stresses .	-5.5638
The Luise Forest Hotel , with its approximately 60 rooms , wants to be broad , explains Scherer .	-5.2173

Russia ’ s Affairs : US Special Investigators set Grand Jury on a Russianaffair . by , by . , , by , by	-10.1868
The Russian affair for US President Donald Trump is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report by Special Robert Mueller .	-3.2823
In recent weeks , the body has begun the work , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " on the basis of familiar people .	-5.5926
The newspaper graduated as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations .	-2.9206
The CNN broadcast reported that there are already initial submissions from the body related to a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.3741
US secret services have long accused the Kremlin of interfering targeted in the 2016 presidential election .	-2.7667
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.2743
Several men are focused on the investigation campaign as Republican advisor .	-4.0959
According to reports , Mueller also lured more and more of Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.2772
The ' Washington Post ' wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Investigator Trump personally moved to the centre and investigated the accusation of whether the president might have hampered justice during the affair .	-4.7684
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible cases of crime and to determine whether charges are to be charged . by or not , .	-11.3921
Grand Jurys are also called charges .	-2.9781

The Board can also be activated by the Public Prosecutor to submit people for interrogation under Eid .	-5.5016
According to the CNN transmitter , templates were issued that turned around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer . with the . the was . , , the with . , , by the . the	-17.1957
People involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , as the report says .	-3.4869
They should also provide documents .	-1.1637
In addition to Trump ’ s Jr. , Trump ’ s adviser and son Jared Kushner , as well as his then head of election campaign Paul Manafort , joined the discussion .	-4.5831
Lawyers said on Thursday evening in US television that the argument shows that Mueller is not intimidating his work and that if necessary , he wants to act quickly .	-4.9047
But it must not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will end up activating to determine the charge .	-4.5353
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations , and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-11.8276
In the middle of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to represent the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.0943
" The Russian story is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.6175
The theme gives the Democrats a chance to ' feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . '	-3.3569
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb declared in an opinion that he did not know anything about setting up a Grand Jury .	-2.6831
He also worked in secret , but he usually stressed .	-3.5383
The White House supports any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Investigator in a " fair " way .	-3.4907
The former FBI chief , James Comey , said three times that it would not be determined against the president .	-2.5620
There is no reason to assume that this has changed , as the declaration continued .	-3.9942
Mueller was only deployed after Trump Comey was fired .	-1.5451
Accusations against Trump had become accusations of his desire to impede justice .	-4.8068
Comey said in June to a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop investigations against the then national security adviser , Michael Flynn .	-3.3401
The President is under great pressure due to the investigation .	-1.7955
According to U.S. media , the White House collected material against the Special Investigator and his staff .	-3.6424
The triggered speculation over whether Trump Mueller wanted to dismiss .	-3.1445

Antarctica : Gigantic Eisberg drives in Antarctica	-10.5352
In the West Antarctic a gigantic iceberg from Berlin 's almost seven times size has been resolved .	-5.1964
This was shared by the Bremerhaven Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday .	-2.4603
More than one trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres are now driving to the north , and will probably need two , three years before they have melted .	-5.6573
With 175 kilometres length and a width of up to 50 kilometres , it is one of the largest icegigants who have registered researchers over the past three decades .	-4.2464
There is no risk to people .	-2.6911
The extent to which climate change has played a role in the break-up of the iceberg is unclear according to researchers .	-3.4308
However , for some 30 years there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice sails in the region , the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) is writing in a factual background .	-4.4264
In the opinion of many researchers , global warming may be linked .	-4.0088
The now abandoned coloss has been part of the Larsen C helping .	-12.7049
Schelfeis swimming on the sea and is fed by great glaciers .	-2.2825
It thus continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .	-3.7112
The Larsen C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula .	-3.1920
North of this grip was the balance of growth and breakdown a few years ago .	-3.8333
Daniela Jansen wrote a complete helfeis for disintegration .	-6.1589
The Larsen C helicopter is also in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn so far as it is now .	-4.3529
In addition , the ice plate is tense and can fall apart if a piece is disrupted .	-6.0902
Melting Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea levels because they swim on the water and displaces ice as much water as it does after melting .	-5.5318
However , loss of the skin celebrates the event that glaciers can move directly to the sea and flow much faster than before .	-6.5418
This may increase sea levels , but only to a small extent , the British research project writes to monitor the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-3.9695
The Larsen C helicopter is the fourth largest Antarctic grade according to AWI specifications , with nearly 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.7713
At the moment of the mainland it is up to 700 metres thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 metres .	-12.5764
There it breaks regularly .	-2.2119
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.5100
" This is the widest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.6361
Scientists were controversial as to whether the Larsen-C skelfeis is going to grow again or back in the long term , and perhaps collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.8153
But this development will take decades .	-1.4034
While these researchers do not attribute this gigantic iceberg to climate change , in recent decades the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen into a great many ice cliffs .	-5.8174
This long peak of Antarctica stretches towards South America .	-2.5087
According to the research programme British Antarctic Survey , the Antarctic Peninsula 's ice surface has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950 's .	-3.0207
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline .	-2.4800
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years and count among the areas where temperature is rising fastest .	-4.1629

Just shortly before the summer break , the Kreistag conducted 41 new posts in the administration .	-5.2419
More than 1100 employees and officials work for Mettmann circle administration .	-1.6568
Now 17 trainees have left behind their first day of .	-3.7209
The lessons at the circle are obviously very much sought after .	-3.5270
Around 620 applications were listed for the seats to be awarded this year .	-3.6046
Yet the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks .	-3.5740

Doctors and engineers , among others , and forces of general administration , are sought . and , , and . , , with , , , , and , .	-12.3582
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , wants to take the initiative in Kreistag and confront the administrative shortage of professionals .	-4.8756
The administration is to draw up a concept of personnel recovery and development according to the wishes of the parties ' .	-4.4056
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs for professionals but to counter the shortage of applicants in the future .	-3.4085
The overall concept should be indicated internally and externally , with practical measures for cross-beginners and with a training offensive , requires CDU , FDP and UWG .	-22.4419
This is sound after a good approach .	-3.8567
The circle has to deal with personnel problems that were not known earlier .	-3.8428
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.0219
The speech is about a regular ' public employer competition ' .	-3.6821
In addition , a large number of employees are eliminated from service disease or age condition .	-4.6943
It is high time to act , so that more jobs do not remain unoccupied .	-3.8788
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples , head of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.5076
He recently saw a thick surprise in Kremlin when he publicly challenged staff coverage and stunned the other parties .	-6.0705
People would like to see all the possibilities available to leave the municipal employers ' association .	-3.9800
" If we do not seek a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the circle administration with the trade unions - perhaps in collaboration with circle cities - should seek a house fare , " said peoples .	-5.7092
This means that the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than providing for public service pricing .	-4.7961
The salaries are exactly stipulated , there are increases or more money only when changing to a higher level based on professional years .	-4.4942
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .	-2.6056
Just a few weeks ago , new spaces were needed to deal with the provisions of the new prostitute protection law . the and the .	-17.1320
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Director Martin Judge have a problem : they have too little staff .	-3.0135
Italy exacerbates the tone of NGO migrant bailout boats	-2.6128
Italy has warned NGOs that rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean are not allowed to continue this unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.8082
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.1048
Minnitis ’ s warning came one day after the Italian authorities confiscated a boat from the German Aid Organization ' Youth Rettet ' , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-19.0891
The aid organization , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to give its opinion on extensive accusations by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.9505
" For us , saving human life is and will remain our top priority , so we are very sorry that we are not currently able to operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on social media .	-4.3370
" We can only judge all accusations currently made after we have collected all the information and can judge the situation " .	-3.6911
The Italian authorities have been monitoring the boat of ' Youth Rett ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-13.1939
It is assumed that his crew takes hookboat migrants on board , which are delivered directly by traffickers , and that the smugglers can leave to reuse the vessels .	-5.6291
At least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the Act of the Public Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.7777
The occupation is suspected of overcoming the authority of the Italian coast guard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-2.7323
Under the code of conduct , boats like the Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer monitoring their activities .	-2.7281
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.4992
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring any ' major changes or disability ' to their rescue actions .	-4.4219
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize laureate organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.4052
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after Italy ’ s rescue has declined sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen Libya ’ s coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.1870
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the minister said .	-2.3842
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-3.2947

E-sport is already part of the official programme for the 2022 Asian Games .	-2.5748
But is it a real sport ?	-2.3650
For many , the idea is certainly needed to get used .	-3.4186
Ingo Frobesque has also dealt with the issue for a long time .	-3.3653
E-Sport is a sport for the professor at the Deutsche Sportschule in Cologne , because it is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that are also found in classical sport - for example , increased heart rates , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-4.3750
It also requires cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid response capability .	-2.7710
Professional gamers should train not only on the console , but also on their body and pay attention to nutrition .	-2.9176

Michelle Carter condemns Conrad Roy for suicide .	-2.4373
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-11.8841
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on trial .	-2.9107
Carter was convicted of negligent killing of Conrad Roy in June 13 , 2014 .	-2.9458
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is unconventional .	-2.8030
My son was my best friend . '	-0.7266
Carter was allowed to remain free until vocation .	-2.3939
She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her right-wing representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered a mental disease .	-3.9478
In red trousers and a cream coloured blouse dressed , Carter stood in the eyes with tears , with folded hands and down eyes when she was convicted .	-4.2566
" Your actions killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-9.9630
" They ended his life to make their own better .	-2.2265
She assumed no responsibility , " she said .	-1.6289
'She has not shown any repentance ' .	-1.7449
But Carter 's lawyer said that it was a ' terrible circumstance that she regrets completely ' .	-3.6443
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not discover that her " age or maturity level or even her mental illness have a significant impact on her actions " .	-3.9823
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy ’ s mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is no day on which I am not consuming the loss of my beloved son .	-3.8549
I want him to be proud of me and how I treat everything , and I try to be there for his sisters despite all my pain that we will carry for eternity , " it says .	-5.9313
Roy ’ s sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would " persecute " by knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother , or would be for .	-4.5568
" No longer having this only person with whom I was together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-4.1937
The case seems to set a legal precedent , since there is no law in Massachusetts , which makes it a crime , calling on another to commit suicide .	-4.2335
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.4647
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text communications revealed that she had encouraged him to stop his life .	-3.4216
" Hong , jump from a building , jump yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news she sent her in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.5980
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-3.3364

Something else was different in his cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even if the additional piece of clothing was very small .	-4.1074
But since there was no Philipp Lahm and no manuel new to see on the second day of the Audi Cup , he kept the bond allocated to him .	-5.7688
" The trainer has not announced it , " said the confed cup winner , after his first deployment as Bavarian captain .	-4.0870
Good , the stock could have been better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-4.2005
But the character of the coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-2.8442
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was chosen as a player in the C-Elf , who had just come out of the holiday , as a player , but he .	-5.9366
We prefer to distribute sugar to those who are very familiar with everyone who wants to keep up with mood .	-6.7058
Those who have been scorned to take up the legacy of Lahm can use a small extra motivation only well .	-3.7687
Kommich confirmed : " This is what you like as a player to take responsibility " .	-4.1972
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old was a mini-lahm flying over the field .	-3.7660
To the right , this is now his position , the white binding on the arm did its rest .	-3.3027
And Kimmir seemed like the one who could best handle the ruder .	-4.8871
He gave instructions to attempt to direct the unmatched troop . , , , , , , in , .	-12.3979
He had a look for the whole , while many others were concerned with himself .	-3.5620
Vidal with playing his lack of fitness ( hardly folding ) ; Renato Sanches associated with devils coming out of the Asian journey ( also folded ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle are not negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian Trikot .	-7.0489
That , after all , failed very well .	-3.0027
Süle ran beside Kimmir , Rudy before defense , both operated sovereign .	-3.9883
The famously occupied Napoli storm found it hard to do , as well as trying to succeed in the game building a few times .	-6.1262
His colleague Mr Rudy admitted that the result ' was not what we hoped for . '	-3.0395
But he also showed a good achievement in the debut .	-2.2514
Handling , Tempowech : " I was even held for this style .	-5.8051
How unusual this Bavarian world is for new entrances , one looked after the game .	-4.6639
Rudy , for example , did not have one or two in the catacombs , but determines six or seven interviews .	-3.3268
Kimmich abandoned some crazy statements on the back of his new players .	-3.9700
He heard from Süle an interesting sentence : " What is going on here I have already noticed .	-3.8596
For Bavaria you just have to win every game " .	-2.8944
After all , he no longer has to teach the new one .	-4.1860

Company satisfied with the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economic praise of Wissing ’ s pace	-4.4366
It was often inconceivable , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-3.4989
This is shown after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Mr Wissing , is in office .	-3.9345
Chambers and companies in the region speak of T V request about change in economic policy - and simultaneously replace the old minister .	-4.0754
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing addresses the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.1133
The biggest turnaround sees Natus in infrastructure policy : the gap in motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-4.2863
This year , the Ministry hopes for a plan finding procedure , and by 2021 the right of construction will be in place .	-4.3345
A role in the country 's plans also plays the Western circumvention of Trier , which is predominantly in the Federal Transport Plan .	-5.1884
The aim is to start the course in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-2.8702
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-2.6703
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) , as suggested by Wissing , strives to achieve a Rhineland-Palatinate label in order to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been backing for ten years .	-5.3493
In addition , Wissing praises the IHK for people who want to establish their own company .	-4.2242
The handicraft chamber Trier sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.6491
The planned premium is EUR 1 000 for the existing master examination and EUR 2500 if graduates are self-employed within ten years after master training .	-5.6013
However , the country 's domestic list remains long .	-3.1238
The planned road construction should quickly create facts , at the same time it lacks the country ’ s staff , says Jan Glockauer , the IHK Trier ’ s main business manager .	-6.6154
Of 56 new engineers wanting to stop knowing mobility in local operations , only 29 posts have so far been filled .	-5.0338
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .	-2.1908
CDU Group Vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations from the Court of Auditors that the country invests more than EUR 20 million in the preservation of national roads in 2017 and 2018 .	-3.4613
Frank Natus also expects a country concept to fix its shortage of professionals in the region .	-3.7664
It is also sobering that broadband has been built in the country .	-3.8143
In 2016 , regional companies only evaluated network supply in an IHK survey with note 3.4 .	-3.2137
They complained about faltering Internet connections and breakdowns .	-2.3418
Ex-Minister Eveline Lemke , on the other hand , is now out of politics and still sits in the Pro Wind Supervisory Board .	-3.7294
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe , where , after four months of disagreements , it was already clearing the field .	-3.7424
Audi is due to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash facing a backlash .	-10.4399
A day before the Audi announcement , BMW said that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.4784
The BMW chairman said that the company believed that there are more intelligent options than restrictions on driving , and referred to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based , to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-4.0708
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-1.8511
None of the companies described the entrepreneurs as a repudiation .	-10.8183
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with rules on carbon dioxide emissions .	-2.1952
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-1.8585
The costs for car manufacturers to install systems for neutralising the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep car price competitive .	-4.0904
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-2.8683
Companies are trying to avoid mistakes made by Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called switching devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested but dropped in the event of normal driving conditions .	-4.7991
In the United States several Volkswagen employees have been charged , and others are investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.6297
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics in Audi engine development was arrested in Germany .	-2.1800
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.2260
Earlier this year , Audi was included in German criminal investigations by Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a question focused on the United States has been extended .	-4.6252
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could heavily burden Volkswagen : The luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.2987
This message has the flow of the Isar Floss on Saturday .	-3.2340
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.3164
For visitors to Isar to join , tomorrow Saturday a flow is going through Munich , which has a special message .	-4.8965
Who attracts the Isar again on Saturday , there will be a big flow between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-4.1749

There is a large info transparent on the flow .	-4.1457
It shows a Müllberg .	-1.1036

Mordillos Kollennasen and Laughter against suffering	-2.7556
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most popular cartoon drawings , the Knollnasen of his characters are his trademark .	-3.4767
Even with 85 the Argentinean is drawing and working on a film .	-11.7826
His message : laughter , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-1.8099
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-2.0928
During his first years as an artist , he also served as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him .	-5.0543
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when my job lost , " he once said .	-1.8805
After his sixties in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in publishing his cartoons in Paris Match , and then in " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.5057
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.1773
The artist has always been inspired by cities .	-2.5631
Large , round Mordillo figures surround themselves in drawings with the sleeping tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-3.4589
In the early morning he is still on the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.5740
Through calendars , puzzles , books for large and small , t-shirts , plushing animals and clocks , his rolling characters continue to find a great deal of spread around the world .	-5.7540
For six years he has also worked on a character trick film and a TV series with his characters .	-3.2079
The main person in the movie " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - murdillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-4.6316
His figures speak for the first time in the 3D movie , which is to enter the cinema objection in 2019 .	-4.6174
" I don 't know exactly what they will say it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.1116
The screen is not written by him .	-1.5885
This is why it places more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced worthless .	-4.1444
Lavendel from Provence threatens climate change	-1.1454
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is under threat of climate change .	-1.8383
The Lavendel is declining because of the conditions that are reminiscent of drought and because of the diseases , which causes scientists and farmers trying to find solutions to be headache .	-5.1971
Eric Chaisse , expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in the Provence , said : " The lavender in the Provence is effectively jeopardized , because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.9723
This affects the life of Lavendel .	-2.0551
There is also a small zikade , a microbacterium transferring dwarf zikades , and there are many of them in very dry weather ' .	-12.4312
And the stakes are high .	-1.4019
Lavendell not only attracts holiday makers , it is also needed for perfumes and cosmetics .	-4.3156
Eric Chaisse said : Instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have been smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.9464
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-1.9707
The solutions being considered include better water distribution and slowing down the soil , but also spraying the plants with a protective mix of sound and water and developing varieties more resistant to drought .	-4.9788
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200 years of existence .	-12.9679
Festival point is this Saturday and Sunday with a Middle Ages festival .	-2.6443
Krämer , Zünften , Traders , Vagants or a land square camp are to be experienced at these days in the city centre .	-6.5240
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-1.5720
Riodoce workers usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and constant drugs wars . in and in . the of , , , , by and in . the of and , the was , by .	-14.2024
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.3080
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.0050
Two high-level journalists discuss what is more secure : they are meant to bring their children to the office in 2009 , who were the goal of an attack with granates , or let them home .	-6.1620
Security experts have written three words to a board on the front of the room : opponents , neutral , allies .	-2.2467
You ask reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and belly feelings are enough . , , , , , in the , , , in the , .	-12.2757
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of standing on the government 's salary list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals who danger the chaos of Mexico .	-3.5568
There is no rest of violence , and while the corpses are accumulating throughout the country , more and more journalists are there : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are under federal protection and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.3100
Among the latter is her editor and inspirator of Riodoce , the cofounder of Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-11.1464
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his many books about violence related to drugs .	-2.6935
The failure of his presence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his middle-finger with the word " Justice " depends on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-5.7612
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their nightmares , impunity , paranoia .	-3.3183
Although a special federal prosecutor was set up in 2010 to handle the cases of journalists , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , it launched only two criminal proceedings .	-3.5764
As with most thousands of murders every year involved in drug trafficking and organised crime , journalists ’ murderers are rarely tried .	-3.0017
Riodoce still insists on treating the violence of Sinaloa , despite being unconventional , despite the fact that the territory is even more treating .	-4.9497
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-12.2532
" It 's very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.6525
'Until we know why , we distrust everyone . '	-2.4031
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-2.9132
He was forced to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , and was forced out of his car and 12 times was shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - translated with " Twelve River " .	-5.3690
The shooters left their car and damaged it nearby .	-3.0571
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.7299
He left a woman and two adult children .	-0.8422
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culiacan .	-1.7589
But on Valdez , there is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.3408
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival groups are struggling to fill the vacuum .	-2.7777
There is no point in Sinaloa shooting anyone or more people every day on the streets , or that the graveyard is full of decorated , two-storey mausoleums for drugs who are larger than many homes for the lives .	-5.3311
Forget for one minute that there is a state of rest if only one cartel has control of the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .	-16.4347
Nonetheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , with the guilt that he could not protect his friend .	-3.1818
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.1717
First there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.0203
This publication may have annoyed the sons , suspected Gung members buy each copy of the output as soon as they were delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.4729
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after confiscating another newspaper , which had published the same history .	-2.7825
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.6866
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-1.9954
He was an experienced reporter for Northeast in 2003 when he joined five colleagues in establishing Riodoce and sold 50 US dollars .	-4.6093
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the noise toxic problem , " said Bojorquez .	-12.9817
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.9972
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-met investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication where they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.3756
Eight years after Riodoce was established , it received the prestigious " Maria-Moors Cabot Prize " for its reporting in Latin America .	-2.7466
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever it leads .	-3.4757
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-0.9160
" I want to continue living " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.9240
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.3152
" You must take over the task that random you as a journalist - either that or you play the dumb .	-3.7909
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many datters ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-3.7996
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird that could fly like a port worker , the friend who was generously with enemies and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.6841
They familiar with his routine .	-2.1756
He would always bear his hat .	-0.8884
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit there on the same table .	-2.9120
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his forgiveness ?	-2.1105
His death has also forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her job while still alive .	-3.5455
" They may not deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to get drugs moved .	-4.2025
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.4719
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-maintenance .	-1.9904
His own instincts trust .	-1.2137
If it goes wrong , remain out of it .	-2.4233
The anger is , said the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that ' smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then is the thing happening with Javier ' .	-3.8207
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they are in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.4840
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.3086
In the space where Riodoce workers met for security training , no mobile phones were suddenly permitted , and it was previously known that spyware sold to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.1128
There were two policemen seeking protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.7192
They were commissioned by the national government to protect Riodoce ’ s offices in a four-storey building in a middle class area of Culiacan .	-3.3035
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers belong to the 50 % of the police that the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-3.8805
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountains , where the drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.4080
For this week ’ s edition , Riodoce looked at three main stories .	-3.5803
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.0315
They also had an exposé on state expenditure concentrated on the governor ’ s home town .	-3.4079
And there was a group carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the public prosecutor .	-3.2186
There was no official word about who was abducted or how it happened , so there was caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favorite place for drug traffickers and authorities .	-3.8223
A reporter informed public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all of the century ’ s political levels .	-4.1179
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of corruption for high-grade cases .	-2.2179
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including a son of " El Chapo " Guzman abandoned a military attack .	-3.6950
Only a few months before , the readers would have considered the Valdez column to be the best informed source of abduction .	-3.6233
" Previously we already knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the top name " El Flaco " because of its lean body stature .	-3.6332
" Now all channels of communication are broken with our sources . "	-2.0703
Valdez ’ s office was devoted to the storage space for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-4.9884
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the public prosecutor .	-4.1721
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.7626
A burned body was discovered and officials said , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-1.9813
Journalists have become louder throughout the country by writing on walkways and buildings in organised protests " SOS Press " .	-4.2150
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gain international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-3.1647
In a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa , on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists , because they said the truth .	-13.2106
Since then , she has asked that she be re-divided by the government , because it is concerned that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-13.0406
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crimes , involved government officials and an indifferent society .	-2.7051
In his last book , " Narco-Journalism " he wrote that reporters were killed not only by drug gangs , but also on orders from politicians and security forces that were sitting under a ceiling with organised crime .	-4.8801
The Articulo 19 media guardian group gave more than half of the attacks on police and official journalists last year .	-2.8148
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-1.5645
Obviously , the murders have a dissuasive effect .	-1.8544
No one forgets the death of Blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-1.9628
Your body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-16.7926
A computer keyboard and headphones lay beside their separate head .	-2.5726
Some branches have chosen to close , like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.9276
Others continue to do as El Mananana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.9655
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drugs cartels with a title article entitled " What do you want of us ? "	-4.2351
Some journalists have fled from their native states , or even from the country .	-2.5486
It is a painful decision .	-1.0685
It is hard to find work in exile , and they still observe the roads and look for dangers .	-10.7081
And sometimes they are driven , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the escape from Veracruz in 2015 along with four women in an apartment in Mexico city .	-3.4866
For those who are lagging behind and continuing work , it is a dance with risky choices .	-3.4786
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking shows him .	-2.2565
" Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I was reporters , " he said .	-1.9954
Around midnight on Friday , when the last edition was finished , Riodoce editors were sitting in front of the office and dry beer , when everyone started to sum their phones .	-5.8460
A number of shot rubbers with band rivals and security forces near Mazatlan bathing resort had left confirmed deaths in 19 .	-3.8089
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-1.7509
From the board stone edge , they have published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-3.7426
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.4180
Sirenen collected nearby - another shooting in the area .	-2.6348
Bojorquez threw a glance at the police officers who held guard to see if they were willing .	-3.8928
If they were afraid at all , they did not show .	-2.3376
Under the huge portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose middle-finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa , Riodoce staff followed his traces .	-3.4928
" As you can only remember to close , " said Bojorquez , " when the same day Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send them to the streets for reporting . "	-4.6875
Dinosaur used charming to escape his enemies .	-2.5906
At first sight , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening .	-2.1296
Now researchers have found that the first findings of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker were received so well that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of dinosaurs " .	-3.5193
It was so good that they could even discover that his scalp skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a " troubled past " .	-5.1301
The report in the Current Biology magazine referred to it as ' the best sustained dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaurs in the world ' .	-3.9706
The fossil is a newly discovered kind of nodosaur living between 110 million and 112 million years ago in the middle of the circle time .	-11.5966
His incredibly well-preserved state has stunned researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-2.6586
According to reports in National Geographic , the tailored fossil of its kind is the most preserved .	-3.9246
It was found by Shawn Funk when , on 21 March 2011 , he grub at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.8531
He met something that was missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.7056
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-1.8443
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the pound of 2,500 kg ( 1,100 kg ) of severe earth clumps .	-3.6622
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.7714
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to see .	-3.6892
" It will go into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . " "	-14.9909
Researchers found that although it is covered with armor and resembles a change tank , it was probably threatened by meat eating dinosaurs .	-4.7462
The strongly armed dinosaur used a red and white disguise to hide from predator animals and used a shielding technology known as counter-patching , which is also used by many modern animals .	-5.6612
This would have allowed us to interfere in its surroundings and avoid enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by bigger dinosaurs .	-4.6966
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaur family has made headlines in May for the first time and is now on the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.2033
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum Engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-4.1683
The surprising conservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-3.1697
They discovered countershadow , a common defense method in animal realm , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-14.1336
Although the counter-shadow is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today .	-4.1272
It suggests that the dinosaur was chased by enough pressure by meat eat-eating dinosaurs that evolution favored the veiling of confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.9985
But most contemporary animals that use the counter-shadow - think of shirts , zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this nosaur was exposed to a real battle for survival .	-4.9234
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , strongly tailored dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the circular time had been , " said Brown .	-4.9649
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.0384
Scientists continue to investigate the animal for evidence of his life , including his preserved intellectual content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-4.4569
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was rivered into a river and driven beyond the sea , where he drove on the back to the sea .	-5.1912
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further lands than they are today .	-3.3500
" This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scalp skin , but also maintained in three dimensions , and maintains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-11.9978
" The result is that the animal now looks almost as in the early credit time .	-3.7450
You don 't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it ; if you shoot a bit with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is at the sleep .	-21.5268
The circuit time was a time when huge theropodes , meat-freezing dinosaurs , which stood on two legs , passed through the earth .	-5.3917
Although the king of them who lived Tyrannosaur Rex , millions years after Borealopelta , the tailored dinosaur was driven by some of his dreadful ancestors .	-4.0297
This includes Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-2.5161
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal believe that Borealopelta was ranked after death in the sea and mummified in mud .	-4.1767
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grabed on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.8063
According to the museum , it is the best-preserved dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hip .	-3.9199
The creatures were on average about 18 foot ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.9624
It contained two 20 inch long peaks raised by his shoulders .	-2.3943
The researchers believe that tanked plant frescoes were flooded by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-4.2075
But the dinosaur ’ s underwater burial preserves its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.7699
The perpetrated remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin rests still cover bulky tank panels along the dinosaur .	-4.9560
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is rare as a profit in the lotto .	-12.8289
The more I see it , the more confusing it will .	-1.2620
Auctioned remains of the skin still cover the bulky tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-3.6981
His right lead is on his side , his five fingers are upwards .	-3.8856
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.8907
Im Weitter : Masse karambolage auf A8 : Many Injured Verhänder vWWWWedWWWWWWWWW	-11.2913
Fertile accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass bomb .	-3.9927
There are numerous injured , kilometre-long traffic and guffer .	-2.9939
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass cambola late Thursday afternoon .	-4.0913
According to the first details of the police , Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aicach-Friedberg district ) were intertwined between 30 vehicles , including probably also trucks .	-5.8681
First there is no information about the exact number of injured .	-5.0851
It is light to medium injuries , said a police spokesman .	-3.7825
A great deal of rescue vehicles was in the hands of the accident . the was . the was . the was . , , , ,	-12.2188
The A8 was completely blocked towards Munich .	-1.3598
In the direction of Munich , an approximately ten kilometres of long backstop was formed .	-3.7199
As an AZ reporter reports , massive handicaps occurred on the danger track - with many guppers .	-5.2465
The fire brigade was quoted by the vehicle leaders , who now face sensitive penalties .	-4.4412
After 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.4372
There was a collision between a car and a car .	-2.0097
A helicopter was on the way to the accident .	-1.8512
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.1037
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing wrong is sitting in the train and sleeping .	-3.8113
Or you are deeper in your work and have just a great idea .	-3.3696
And then : buff .	-0.4637
Comes the Schaffner and arouses an unsoft and tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-5.0237
Ticket control .	-1.4436
But the interruptions are over .	-1.7303
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unstable ticket control .	-2.8944
One simply confirms by mobile that you take your seat and thus devaluate your ticket .	-4.9767
A test operation is currently running on two tracks .	-1.7562
" When the offer comes on , we expand it .	-3.2347
It will probably be available on many other television routes in Germany early next year , " said a railway spokesman .	-4.7074
" Comfort check-in " calls the ticket valuation without Schaffner .	-2.7844
In order to be able to use them , however , a few requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.3107
And you have booked an online ticket , which in any case most passengers do .	-3.7097
You must also buy it via the app of the train that DB Navigator bought , which is the most convenient way of booking tickets .	-4.5549
And last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-2.5655
Because " Comfort Check-in " works this way : You get in the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.1312
A button for electronic devaluation appears with the test customers .	-2.9360
The train companions receive a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and have taken the booked seat Y .	-4.8652
When the train accompanyer is checked at Y he knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-5.2676
So you can sleep further , continue to work , silence .	-3.4508
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railways , which in turn should use the passengers .	-3.5919
" Whoever wants to travel without ticket control by our train personnel is simply checking in the DB Navigator . by , .	-19.5704
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Far Traffic .	-3.0641
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than they are today to address individual customer needs " .	-3.2592
Whoever frequently travels train knows that , alongside delays and missed trains , ticket controls are one of the biggest troubles .	-5.5221
Because you often have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not include all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-6.1825
Either the credit card or the identity card or any other document you have to sh.	-4.0132
The result is endless discussions between train companions and passenger passengers , leading to poor mood in the department or large room and delay in controlling your own ticket and at the end of the day taking time to look after other concerns .	-6.5498
Only a small number of customers can still use the new service .	-1.8706
And that also only on ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food .	-2.8524
Another tractor numbers on the same track are still not activated .	-3.8705
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-1.9420
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shocked to her core .	-2.5395
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , sat the born in St. Louis , on the bed of an airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled by Facebook on her phone .	-4.1573
She stumbled about a post from someone from the High School .	-12.1078
" The police killed a 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " said there .	-2.9369
Confused because nobody else posted the information on her feed , closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.9367
A user with the handle @ TheePharoah has been retweeted constantly on their timeline . , and by . the , of , by and , by . the of , and	-15.1011
Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was in the process of live tweeting the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18 year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-3.9594
He posted a picture of Browns lively body that was stretched out on the street and would stay there four hours .	-3.6284
" That is wild , " Ferrell thought in itself .	-3.1677
But the death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.2502
She dismissed her mobile phone to return to Tweets later in the evening on the Canfield Drive .	-3.9059
There were photos of the police band and people who scribed , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father who carried a shield with the script : " Ferguson 's police killed my unarmed son just ! "	-4.4838
She watched a live feed where a police officer stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a bad dog .	-3.4626
In another video , she said , another policeman determined his gun and shouted : ' I will kill you all . '	-4.0620
" This is not customary , " Ferrell reminded us of her statement .	-2.7428
'That is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can typically name . '	-3.3027
At this moment I felt butterfrost .	-2.4489
I was angry and crying . '	-1.7554
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.3515
After landing at 23 p.m. , she returned her 6-year-old daughter from her father ’ s house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson the next morning .	-5.9837
What happened over the next three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from 11 .	-2.7057
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that consists of the people who live in the Community and who have filled the roads to demand answers .	-3.5711
As Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two spoke a conversation that they had innumerable times before this morning » about black experience and black condition « .	-5.0127
" You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? " she reminded of what she said .	-3.2704
" We go to Ferguson now because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.3114
I could not take her with her , " said Ferrell later .	-1.5911
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-1.9514
You must know it and see it and be brought into it .	-3.0860
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the various sections of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to free ourselves .	-4.2988
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different than the next black women ’ s child .	-3.6802
I feel I would do her a bad service to keep them out of it . '	-3.1165
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road , a place compared to the police authority , which was becoming a campsite when the activists were waiting for the possible non-indictment of Officer Darren Wilson . , by , , by .	-12.7624
There Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business holder who made lunch .	-3.5586
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.2432
Slowly a new type of activism for Ferrell started to take shape .	-1.9715
" My activism changed completely after 9 August , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and concentrated on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.2821
" I had no experience in organising .	-1.4253
It all came . '	-2.9620
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.0832
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.0790
One question was asked Ferrell : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can exploit ? '	-3.3271
This scepticism has been nourished by countless cases of people , often of whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience .	-3.7735
As Folayan recently explained in an interview : ' We heard that people born and grown in Ferguson have not centred their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-3.6389
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism rum for death tract insasses .	-14.9555
His engagement brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-4.1137
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us .	-2.4209
" That was the main thing for me as those people are represented , because that is how I will be represented . "	-4.6447
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-3.6180
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell ’ s life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-3.3880
" I felt like naked " , Ferrell said and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.6827
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the manifestation of black people . " . the , , , , , , in , . , , in , ,	-12.6562
Moreover , Ferrell ’ s history reiterates the role of black gay women in the broader Black Lives Matter mo.	-2.9181
Two of the three founders of the movement , which , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , have characterised the film " Blacklivesmatter " in social media , are identified as gay .	-3.7765
" Black , gay women in leadership positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-3.5507
Black , gay women have to bear the burden of everything . '	-1.7816
Folayan agreed to say that ' the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women ' .	-2.5643
It insists , however , that " this is not an affirmative type of action " where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity .	-3.1860
" She was the person who upset this energy , " she said .	-2.3116
" It 's not a coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because a life at these crossings is at stake as a black , gay woman .	-4.5759
You can feel their energy through the screen . "	-2.0496
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-3.0974
Ferrell is on the trip for 2 <unk> years due to the blocking of a highway at a demonstration .	-11.5365
She describes the social and political atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-3.6193
However , she clamps for a vocal and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-4.4739
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.7721
It is our duty to gain .	-1.3987
We must love and support one another .	-0.9232
We have nothing to lose except our chains . '	-1.4657
From " Dream " to " Size Crack " : TV readers discuss bit gallery .	-3.9340
The bit gallery is moving people , even though it is not built for a long time .	-3.3425
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone has split the population into favor and opponents since the first presentation of 2009 .	-3.5549
Cold leaves the topic hardly any one . . , .	-5.0414
The issue is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.8163
While they say to the bit gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " This would be real class " ( Nicole Schaussen ) , coming from the other side : " Do not need a man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Great Crazy ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-6.3039
While advocates are building a gallery to move more clients to the city , benefiting other business , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will then bleed .	-5.8377
In addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot where the farm market hall stands where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-4.1634
That will stop at the start of construction work .	-3.3608
Galerie makers want to integrate a market hall in new construction - to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside .	-4.2442
Simone Room : " We have been buying weekly farm market hall for many years .	-3.4019
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the farmers are always happy .	-4.2425
We also discovered butchery for us .	-2.2829
We hope that even during and , above all , after the construction of the gallery , there is a chance to keep this offer su.	-3.9955
In other cities it also exists .	-2.5578
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting ' .	-2.4659
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery is at the height of the rental .	-3.9063
But I think the new project is probably not very low . '	-4.4624
Eva Kilic : " What shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.7779
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets , I find that superfluous .	-2.7565
We have enough of these in our city .	-2.9101
You can see how many shops are empty here - some have been months and years .	-2.7865
However , since we do not even have a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we maintain at least the market hall .	-4.0024
After all , the product offered there is fresh , is mostly offered directly by the producer and is cheap .	-4.2204
As you can see , store stores in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not sustainable to a retailer .	-5.1372
It is a pity that special shops are almost no longer in existence , and what remains will also disappear . '	-14.8410
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall doesn 't fit me for me .	-12.8244
And the gallery does not fit into Bitburg .	-1.6097
Above all , where is the farming market hall to be found during construction time ?	-2.8859
The old edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the bit gallery actually comes .	-3.8196
Or is the Ghost Bit Gallery already managing to drive all business from Bitburg ? "	-16.5489
George Marquet : " That simply will not work .	-1.5766
And a shopping center that stands empty does not need anyone .	-3.0246
In my view , it would have been preferable to promote a real farming market instead of this gallery .	-2.8562
But there is no place for a farming market hall thanks to the madness of many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-4.0049
When the farming market hall is broken down , another piece of culture will disappear . '	-3.0169
A matching similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.1304
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables .	-20.0763
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen potters and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.7653
Manning sent the excerpts from the Fort Leavenworth prison , where the former intelligence analyst suffered a 35-year-old imprisonment after publishing a secretly classified diplomatic message about the WikiLeaks website .	-5.1548
The new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is A Becoming Resemblance ( A matching similarity ) .	-14.8935
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey Hagborg , whose discipline unites its expertise in technology , computer science , and art , and manning , a transfrau and pioneering dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in office .	-5.0699
Dewey Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA , extracted by Manning and created 30 portraits , as someone could look like with these genomic data , has a sharp , albeit intellectual comment not only on the formality of DNA data - many ways of interpreting it and creating the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also identity .	-6.6365
Manning , born as a Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , has been condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the Spionage Law , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.1642
Through the prison , her image was oppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a grain , black and white self-life , in which Manning is clearly sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinum piece - with which she was associated .	-5.9050
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project Stranger Visions .	-2.4460
In it , the artist produced portraits of foreign foreign artifacts such as cigarette and chewing gummi by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like .	-4.8511
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-1.9226
" They led an interview with Chelsea Manning while in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " Dewey-Hagborg explained at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.6183
And she could not visit at this time and she could not be photographed , so you took contact with Chelsea and asked them if she wanted to make a DNA a portrait .	-4.3647
The artist and her imprisoned muses became unequal letter-lovers , who exchanged several letters over two years .	-3.5338
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " that was illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which predicted a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be converted and capable of seeing the exhibition personally .	-4.5797
The fact that Obama would indeed demand only a few days after the book was published , Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy .	-3.5087
There is also something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and against Transgender troops to find new , two-way ways to escape the rigid divisions that he should actually fix .	-5.7097
When Dewey Hagborg asked after the strange timing of all these things , she said that ' things happen for a particular reason ' .	-2.9373
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning with its overwhelming signature below ( the " i " in its family name is with a heart ) called an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which was gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-4.6976
On the opposite wall , her mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand president of Cs and Gs and As , is written in Baffeift .	-3.6527
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-2.3467
" What people will hopefully take with them is that our genome doesn 't care about who we are and how open genetic data are for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose Video Work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-12.1728
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so they are 30 of them . "	-2.2247
The last piece of exhibition stored in its own room is a page from the comic novel mentioned above .	-3.1340
She shows Manning as she appears with a telephone from the disciplinary caseras of the United States such as King Kong .	-4.6001
" If you speak your cold speech , you won it , " it says .	-13.3625
" So never let the mouth " .	-2.4744
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greeted Philadelphia .	-1.9591
'I still get escape when I talk about it ' .	-3.2561
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as foreseen in the comicbook - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by its own genomic simularities , which are collapsing like hordes of protesters .	-5.5048
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 " Manning 's stature ) , in which their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil .	-5.3635
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey Hagborg of portraits .	-3.1918
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-3.1948
Professor of the University of Northwestern University and an employee at the University of Oxford for killing .	-3.0785
A nationwide human hunt is undergoing a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are sought as suspicions after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago was fired with deadly injuries .	-5.2590
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the acts of the Cook County Court .	-3.3847
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several stitches .	-2.2233
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-1.9002
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-3.4317
Cornell-Duranleau was still explained to be dead at the site of what happened , and detectives investigate the slogan as murder , while the police actively looking for the two suspects , said officials .	-4.9944
Lathem is an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-1.9438
Alan K. Cubbbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an email statement that Lathem was now allowed to be in permission and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-13.8518
" This is now a criminal matter that is being investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperated in this investigation , " said Cubbbage .	-3.4947
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.1645

The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand up .	-2.9550
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he urged suspects to stand up to the authorities .	-2.5351
" The police has an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to localize them are reinforcing themselves , " said Guglilmi.	-3.7747
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find suspects .	-2.0890
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip that said that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.3842
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.8770
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.3323
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-1.7735
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglilmi .	-1.7015
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the inhabitants : " The police is working on the time axis and the background of the victim and is exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-4.3055
" We will conclude the WADA roadmap in the near future " - Russian Vice-Prime Mutko	-2.3170
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take a long time to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-2.5997
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has obtained the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-2.9435
The WADA roadmap was updated in this regard , " explained Mutko on Thursday .	-1.8299
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code described the criteria for re-establishing RUSADA and published recently on the organization 's website .	-3.5707
According to Mutko , he contains nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia .	-2.3287
" Everything was announced , everything is implemented .	-1.5611
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.7383
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation carried out by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.6512
As regards the matter , Mutko said : " We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake .	-3.9469
All measures have been implemented .	-0.7030
But there were no state programmes and we will not admit anything that does not exist . '	-2.9365
Mutko 's words coincided with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-2.6166
In conversation with Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov added problems of the past to Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.2173
No one wishes to accept this report unconditionally , ' added Smirnov .	-13.0322
RUSADA was excluded from doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the WADA 's doping scandal .	-3.0574
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-1.7902
After a visit to the headquarters of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving in the right direction to be reinstated .	-3.4970
Aldi no longer sells eggs any more for the time being .	-2.7247
That was what the company ’ s groups shared . .	-13.7217
It was a pure precautionary measure that no health impairment could be carried out further , as the communication said . it was in the . the in the , in , in , in .	-19.8885
From now on , only eggs are likely to be supplied to Aldi , which have been tested negatively on fiprony-containing anti-size libs .	-6.0516
Aldi wanted to make clarity and transparency in his clients .	-2.2256
The start-ups that will help your company not become the next Uber .	-2.8726
Amy Errett wanted to measure luck with your e-commerce start up , but surveys did not work .	-2.9373
Answers were often vague , little helpful or - worse - fraudulent .	-2.0261
Even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-2.1687
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-2.5473
She has called people from outside for help .	-1.3740
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help businesses find out how their employees feel like they are .	-4.1383
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it enables companies to conduct surveys , to address special groups and demographic groups , to offer employees anonymity and complaints hotlines , and in some cases to allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C suite executives and to turn directly to the Board .	-4.7956
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and chief executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees ’ commitment .	-13.1501
Sadly said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel won with Glint over the three years .	-4.6152
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys by certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company , which shows at a glance what units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can bore why .	-5.1463
Companies come to realise that at the top of job culture , so that you do not become the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-5.0321
For start-ups like Glint this desire for an overview is a lucrative business possibility .	-2.5343
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Let 's Talk Payments financial site .	-2.9253
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in discredit in the middle of the Uber-trap earlier this year .	-4.1302
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.2906
Uber recently registered as a client .	-1.5686
Like Glint , Convercent sends tailor-made " pulse " surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problems .	-4.0735
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.6300
And if the Managing Director is included , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.5536
" The Court of Public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-11.1257
Quinlan said when a company is found that its employees are poorly treated or unethical , it can have costly consequences through consumer boycott , worker fluctuation and complaints .	-4.6605
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 sites , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple opportunity to reach their corporate centres .	-4.3542
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate central , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.6018
It was often an intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesday ’ s General Council , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-3.5904
Now that the company is using Convercent , problems that previously have been hidden by leaders in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice - can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-4.2522
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree vision of employment , " said Vitrano , who is chairing the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.5900
'And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes ' .	-2.1996
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting firm Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical infringements by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.3660
But it took until the ' social media came to their right ' that companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty launders from going online .	-4.4938
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.2528
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges to use their products .	-3.7926
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital Investors who have supported both start-ups .	-3.4203
Convercent received $ 10 million in funding in February of companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , increasing the total capital to $ 47 million .	-2.6587
Glizers secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought their entire funding to $ 60 million .	-3.4459
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.1982
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done .	-3.0717
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are just deployment .	-2.3571
The employees want to feel that you will be accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.5057
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do worth doing , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.7525
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies operate well , and companies run well when employees work and engage .	-3.8482
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and employee use , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.5424
The data on employee involvement according to experts in the workplace culture is important .	-3.5610
But the data is useless if the company 's managers do not take any measures .	-3.9619
Indeed , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is .	-3.7038
And if change does not come fast enough , or does not at all , it can breed disappointments and discourage employees .	-4.3647
" When asking for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have left too much on data collection .	-4.4962
" If you do not follow will employees ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.5007
Do you take care of that ?	-1.6787
And who do not worry about why should I ? '	-2.7839
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly staff polls , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported on Glint so Srett .	-3.8625
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-3.8551
At Ruby Tuesday , the company always gives new insights to its employees , and in the long run it hopes that this will lead to a better connection between workers in an industry known for high sales .	-5.9992
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.8321
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.7550
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-1.9982
The NCAA eliminates two day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-3.4698
It 's about 23 p.m. when a lot of UCLA football players are talking on a page of the new training fields of the team on the campus .	-4.9504
Some have extracted their tricot components and show the back full of welding from the first day of the training camp .	-2.9473
For a good part of the team these inactive minutes represent a lunch break .	-2.5424
Players who are registered for summer courses will return to their final checks after three hours of exercise before returning to the Water Football Center the next morning at 6 : 30 a.m.	-4.2687
" This is a real truth mill for the boys the next three days , " said Bruins-coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.6409
The NCAA eliminates two day exercises to facilitate the burden of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-3.1754
Therefore , the first three training courses of the UCLA should start at 7 : 15 p.m. to meet the already completed timetables of the players .	-5.4047
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Mora 's six game times in Westwood practical exercises .	-4.4324
During August 18 exercises are to be held , 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-5.2369
Mora said that he supports the NCAA changes , even if they add another point to the multi-employment routes of the players .	-4.5009
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.4768
" And they have simply pressed it , they keep plunging , they are great people .	-12.4429
I think that once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-2.8325
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear visibility of its fields by an adjacent car park and the neighbouring Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been applied with footballs , which removed a protective net behind a peat .	-7.4859
Bruin players should fill the hotel this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-3.2711
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.5704
" This is a real problem and it is not very hard to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to record an exercise there .	-3.6673
If you have the video bond of an exercise , it 's a fairly good business .	-10.5711
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-2.7036
We will do the best with what we have .	-0.8590
I am not too concerned about that .	-2.2948
We have a plan . '	-0.6942
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit news .	-3.0644
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party facts and then show their results under the original contribution , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to combat so-called face-news .	-4.5097
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify potential false messages and send them to fact-reviewers that may display results from the original article 's facts .	-14.5197
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called Fake-News , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .	-3.1159
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to get rid of hateful postings as before the September elections .	-4.3755
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in English that a test of the new facts will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.1438
" Besides knowing which stories are contested by third-party facts , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-3.8659
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature to the " related article " and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .	-3.8268
Create a comic novel : A castle in the history of England	-2.0985
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was to be seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.4085
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophaar Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-4.2784
" I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says horrific .	-3.6983
" What a personal relationship , keep this letter in my hand " .	-1.7947
'A Castle in England ' is surrounded by the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-4.2336
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional .	-11.5587
" I only responded to the thumbnail print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s , who worked for the Jacobiner , " he says .	-3.6503
" That is his thumb print !	-2.2450
And letters always smoke , because at that time a fire was ignored because of the light .	-4.6964
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were present himself .	-2.9225
Oh , I love archives ! '	-0.7076
For someone who is beaten with old papers so that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived nearly four months in a castle ( " To be honest : I have overvalued my welcome greeting a bit " ) , this seems to be all too beautiful to be true .	-15.6747
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hydraulic heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .	-4.8329
He walked through the terrain and the ruins of the ancient castle and spoke to landscape carers , gardens and sometimes also with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-4.2329
Then at night he drink " whiskey and started to write " .	-2.2009
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only gained full access in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.0176
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees just began to look after the archive , which he described as " hundreds of years when Aristocrats said " Oh , thrown it on the roof floor " .	-4.1698
Diaries , letters from the English Empire era , cards representing what was possessed : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fought the two families .	-12.3607
Young , let everything go his way ! '	-3.1227
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , following a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm revolution of 1381 .	-4.4395
" There is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-2.9968
" The agricultural uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good start .	-3.5301
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-1.6983
Other stories are rooted firmly in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the story of the Jesuit patent , which the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English reform .	-4.2440
Or the ' The Smuggler ' , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell was portrayed from the 18th century , who staged his own burial by filling a coffin with stones ( an discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.0744
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The lords seemed to be fairly horny , keep making debts , and spending money on things they could not afford .	-5.1428
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marriing rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good boys , with a talent to advertise earthquakes . ' . in the , , in , , in with the , , in , , in , with , , in	-18.7514
After the end of his operation in the castle , Rhodes is in search of other unique writing experiences .	-4.7459
He has brought a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel behind Elämanmäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early twentieth century , which has since been called back by nature .	-4.9757
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.0694
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.1493
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to get back to condemned life ' .	-3.2716
Starting campaign : Over 300 years old marial chapel in Rhoendorf wrapped up in the village of Rhoendorf . the was by .	-6.4906
With the coverage of the 301 years old Marienkapelle in Rhoendorf , the city of Bad Honnef has launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof mark ( Thursday ) . in , in , in , in . , in , in , , in , in , , ,	-16.4284
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.9514
At the end of August there is to be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.2610
" Good for us .	-2.0674
Or ? " , the leaders of the action since yesterday have been asking on the posters at the Rhoendorf Chapel .	-3.6289
" We do not really think this ( of course ) , write it on your yesterday website .	-3.1814
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.3942
And to make it clear that some are better than it seems .	-1.6743
Basically , we are firmly convinced that , as Bad Honnefer , we are well aware of the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-3.9604
The action is more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it continues .	-3.0132
" We must formulate a sole promise , one that gives the city a distinctive feature of its own " .	-4.4064
Finally , they are in competition with other communities .	-1.9548
A middle five-digit amount will cost Bad Honnef its new roof trademark and campaign .	-3.7512
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s fear of the army	-1.1762
Every beginning of August , Ankara is advising the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on retirement and promotion in the Officer Corps .	-3.7820
That is the same week .	-1.9970
At first glance a normal procedure .	-1.8203
But nothing is routine to the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.1670
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as was previously the Prime Minister ’ s seat .	-4.2519
The five Vice-Prime Ministers and Defence Ministers , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs joined the discussions under the Head of Government .	-3.9629
As a result , the civilians in the YAS were in the overall number .	-3.8173
The government attracts the reins in the military .	-1.4807
While Chief General Hulusi Akar remains in office , the commanders of the army , the Air Forces and the Navy have been removed .	-4.6374
Since the failed coup , Head of State Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-2.3033
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to alleged connections to the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , which Erdogan sees as a wire-zewing of the coup .	-12.2266
There have been negotiations against 486 people who should have been directly involved in the coup attempt in Ankara this week .	-4.3915
Erdogan had already called a “ gift of God ” a day after the coup , because he gave him the opportunity to " completely clean " the armed forces .	-5.7226
But does Erdogan really have the army under control ?	-1.5894
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in the Military Quarter " .	-2.7056
On the general staff there are concerns about an increasing ' Islamisation ' of the army which manifest itself , among other things , in the lifting of the Soldians ' ban on headscarves .	-5.2022
In any case , the big cleaning of the army and the security forces continues .	-4.0486
In mid-July , Erdogan fired another 7395 state servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.0226
Erdogan seemed to have counted the military .	-2.0518
The generals were regarded earlier than the country ’ s predecessors .	-3.5492
Three times they appealed for their role as guardians of the secular order of state .	-3.8411
Following his 2002 election victory , Erdogan pushed down the military ’ s power step by step , not least on the reform prescriptions of the European Union .	-4.4985
Former officers say that Erdogan is driving forces towards Islamisation .	-2.8560
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " a no-named officer who sought asylum for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time .	-4.4958
If that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.9497
In any case , there are doubts about the Turkish army 's willingness to use in the Alliance after the cleansing .	-12.5702
Leadership structures and operational skills are " weakened " , say Nato diplomats .	-2.2414
Washington changes the Green Card rules	-1.2905
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.6662
It envisages lowering legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , tighter rules for obtaining visas for temporary working permission and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-12.7723
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.9996
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-2.2650
'This law will reduce poverty , raise wages and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way the US is spent by Green Cards on citizens from other countries . '	-3.4801
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.1264
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English to support themselves and demonstrate knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-2.6582
Ministry wants to renew track for racing steam huttle .	-4.5851
Time and again , over the past few months , there has been a dispute over the future of the racing shuttle - now it is time to go very quickly .	-5.5962
Still before the end of the year , the marode route on which the tourist railway drives is to be built .	-6.4595
In order to secure the future of the racing shuttle in the long term , construction works shall begin at the route according to the Ministry of Transport .	-5.6382
" With the decision to continue to order and renew the route Ilmenau-Rensteig , the country is committed to this important link , especially for tourism , " stated Secretary of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.1246
The cost of restoring the route was approximately EUR 2.5 million .	-3.1663
Of that sum , the country accounts for 75 % .	-1.5286
The contract , on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in future , is being finally voted , explained Sühl .	-4.1940
The Ministry and the Southern Thuringian Railway are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.7392
" This negotiates the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards , " said Sühl .	-2.8963
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Society will be concluded for 11 years .	-2.2845
This should regularly be ordered on December 2017 .	-3.0266
Rennnsteig Shuttle is a popular railway link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig railway stations .	-4.8146
Over the past few months , during a pilot operation , it has been tested whether the route is used by enough people to order it regularly in the future .	-5.2998
The route is also highly due in parts .	-3.3487
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it .	-1.7126
Precisely when you thought that in 2017 it cannot be madness , a new report on technological developments in the sex robots sector comes .	-5.2305
Yes , in fact .	-1.0123
Sex robots are a big thing at the moment .	-1.5823
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-1.6890
According to Noel Sharkey , emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-2.6372
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast warze and the type of fingernagel .	-3.0417
" People get funny about them , but companies deliver a lot of it , and we will see them much more frequently , " said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-4.0020
Modern sex puppets have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberate human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.1629
The user can also customize his robot according to his convictions and select everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the breast wards to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.1613
But it is even more worrying , as many robots possess " personalities " that would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-3.6906
Modern sex puppets have become robots with a silicone skin .	-11.8027
For example , the RealBotix robot allows users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as bullying .	-4.1728
Then there is the Roxxxy Gold Sex robot developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as " Frigid Farrah " , which conveys the impression of bullying and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-4.7519
" Roxxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted as possible " , warms the True Companion website .	-3.1262
So they like what you like , and they do not like what you do not like , etc .	-2.5757
She also has her moods over the day - quite how real people !	-12.8337
It can be tired of being fixed on conversation or it can be ' in mood ' ! '	-16.0507
There are many worrying aspects of this rise in sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relations - but the subordinate female characteristics , the allegations of rape when one step is addressed to Frigid ( here : reluctant ) Farrah , worry the most .	-5.7839
On his website True Companion Roxxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.7969
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have roxxxxy ? " is it said on the site .	-2.7206
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.3681
Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional admission .	-4.6428
Most men will not keep sex robots , of course , and while the FRR notes their rising popularity , they remain temporarily on the brink of consumer culture .	-4.2250
But what goes through the peripheral areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.3469
And many people are not strange or offensive until they give the free market permission to do so .	-2.3042
There is a certain overlap that this highly developed sex robot emerges at a time when women ’ s rights are under threat worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who has praised attacking women sexually .	-4.8963
The most disgusting aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphical images , the smooth body and the eyes that have been caught up , but how realistic this vision works .	-11.4337
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .	-3.0238
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-2.9971
Their builders want them to feel human enough to emulate the movement of a real body .	-2.4511
But , when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots are not real women .	-2.5224
You cannot separate from your pet or just go away .	-2.7027
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates on independence or anything that might disturb the imagination of a total subjugation .	-17.5296
In other words , they are pleasant slaves .	-1.9917

Trump ’ s Great Performance	-1.3481
He makes Mitt Romney into the concept of common sense .	-2.9088
It has become a wisdom of the Trump era that the political divisions that the US electorate has polarized also divided families in small formats .	-3.6056
There were newspapers in the US about Christmas and Harvest about how to handle Trump ’ s horror of relatives .	-3.6674
We are all supposedly striving to burst our filter bubbles .	-2.5575
Less has Trump ’ s power to bring together families .	-2.1451
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long dealt with the Republicans in our family who visited me in New York this week .	-2.9435
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.5482
With Trump in the White House , everyone who knows , including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and strangely on the same side .	-4.2157
It is certainly a good thing around the dining table , but it strikes me in another context that this entails significant risks as well .	-4.1474
The left was strengthened by Trump , but its presidency ’ s outrageous effect has the power to push us all right .	-4.4226
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we are referring to the cruel possibility that one day his mothers will no longer replace us .	-4.8855
But there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump right-wing Republican “ normalizes ” who suddenly seem to be incompatible with his standards .	-4.3280
Today , I find myself covered by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urkomical version of the mad dog - the car roof that 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax explanation looked ) - both of which , in fact , occurred as a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-6.5773
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be intellectual and healthy only to qualify for an immeasurable improvement .	-3.1483
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the Carousel in Central Park , the biggest of the carousel of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you do not need a boffin .	-4.6900
The horses are enormously large , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are boring and the animals spin to see their own shoulders - extremely darker and the climbing music convey this in a strange way .	-5.8210
So many of a city 's clichés disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines become familiar to offer a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not living up to the dream .	-4.5535
Thirty-five years later , and I am still not entirely overnight when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the Ye Olde Swiss Cottage theme pub is not counted - but a major roundabout in the north of London .	-4.3104
The Central Park Carousell is still a strange magical experience , since there are two two-year-olds , one 11 years old and two women in the 40 ’ s and all have a great time .	-5.9596
If I had been able to rate the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately no one asked for it .	-3.1599
On the other hand , I was forced this week in a store to assess my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get my credit card through .	-4.0801
In the coffee house on the corner of my road , it is the same , plus the option to balance the evaluation with a 15 % tip money - this to buy something over the shop table .	-4.8741
This not only slows what should be a neutral exchange , but also exerts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is needed .	-4.3022
The poor woman in the purchase house was apologizing , while I tired up the experience of having my credit card with five stars .	-4.4148
Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to hospital .	-2.5940
Pistorius left the prison for a visit to hospital for the second time .	-2.6331
Last year he was brought to hospital for treating cuts at his hands , according to the prison authorities , after a case in his cell .	-4.4927
Pistorius was sentenced against a first slaughter for murder after an appeal by the prosecutor .	-3.6669
He killed steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine Day in 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.8697
Pistorius claimed that he was his girlfriend for a night intrusion hiding in the cabin .	-3.6049
The prosecutors have announced their intention , this time , to reject the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appell , which they say is too lenient .	-4.1842
The national law enforcement authority said that they would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection could be heard this year .	-3.3049
Pistorius runs the risk of increasing its penalty to 15 years when prosecutors are successful .	-2.6004
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.6385
Bauer Arnold a strange egg finds as a Bauer Arnold	-10.2876
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the fourth classes were released in the holiday and in the secondary schools .	-4.5007
Three redundant students will go to gymnasium , four to the real school .	-3.8803
On Tuesday evening , the school leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental in Epfenhofen .	-3.5362
As a symbol of school redundancy , the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle that grows up in the chicken court but is then released into freedom .	-4.5546
In addition , the muntere Schar introduced a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hühnerhof auf " .	-11.6853
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , and caused it to erupt from his chickens .	-3.2215
Instead of a chicken kitchen , a small eagle emerged .	-1.3539
But the hope of making him a chicken , the eagle spread his wing and disappeared in a high mountain .	-3.6842
Then the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-3.0888
The hen danced with the young gocks that wore cylinders to bet .	-2.5916
The eagle stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.2225
The young person is different from the other young animals ( kitchen ) , but they . the , in .	-13.1191
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.0074
His provision is free to be .	-2.0697

The time of the kitchen is over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-2.7549
They laid off their students after two years of teaching , for it was a really great time .	-4.5745
After all , they could rely on the fourth classes .	-4.2315
At the end of the day , all students explained a summer and holiday time song .	-4.9241
The children enjoyed great pleasure in doing so .	-3.3404

Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-0.8891
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campsites in Greece , and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-12.0605
On the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegally celebrated people , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.4588
The same day they were released , while an inquiry is ongoing .	-2.7178
The Foreign Ministry reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-1.8796
The Greek authorities have exacerbated control of the free camp and lay down considerable fines for anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.4965
The checks will continue throughout the season .	-1.7623
The Ministry said that the Court could impose a fine .	-1.7726
Software Update for Diesel Vehicles : What stakeholders need to know now ?	-2.9365
How exactly is the software update taking place ?	-1.3870
Do diesel drivers need to participate in the action ?	-2.2679
The most important questions and answers overview .	-2.0531
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-2.7812
They should improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of emission classes Euro 5 and , in part , Euro 6 .	-3.5998
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-1.7275
Anja Smetanin from ACE Club Europe gives evaluations :	-2.0526
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.0175
No , the software updates negotiated are voluntary .	-1.1301
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schummellsoftware , " says Anja Smetanin .	-3.6196
Their retrofit has ordered the Federal Federal Agency ( KBA ) .	-3.5451
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-1.5391
The manufacturers have announced quick implementation over the coming months but have not yet stated a precise date .	-3.8109
Daimler has announced that it will be sent to any person concerned .	-5.0704
If an inspection is already due , it will be done within its framework .	-2.3067
How long will the conversion likely be ?	-2.9959
" Hard to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.1703
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and political pressure .	-2.3185
" Because we have seen that the car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment . " this is . "	-11.9696
How long should the update last ?	-1.4186
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.8799
More time-consuming could be given an appointment .	-3.5555
What do drivers who do not car BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.5182
The ACE advises to wait .	-1.6695
Presumably foreign manufacturers would follow Smetanin .	-2.9185
Does a massive fall in the price of Euro-4 cars ?	-3.4427
ACE is afraid of that . .	-11.8565
But in the regions where there is a threat of bans on driving .	-2.5800
There have been no loss of value in rural areas for older diesel .	-2.5627
The ACE advises to wait for a sale still .	-1.8283
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award .	-1.5441
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington .	-1.1158
President Trump ’ s first prize promise to become political .	-1.7684
One of the winners who wants not to come - protests .	-3.4308
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets the first rapper one of the well-known Kennedy Center awards .	-2.7156
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and Choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the honored .	-3.5645
The awards will be handed over at the beginning of December .	-1.5237
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and , together with his wife Melania , will take part in the rental .	-3.0766
The award-winning Lear , known as progressive TV series , has already announced that it will not participate in the gala .	-4.9155
" New York Times " he said : " This presidency has decided to completely neglect arts and human rights - even to withdraw the funds - and that affects me " .	-4.9936
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the talk with Trump to make her view clear .	-3.5581
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.3125
Prize winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-1.9931
We make the city life-value for the city .	-2.9903
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s Municipal Builder , will be retiring next year .	-3.8400
The place is already posted - suitable candidates are rare .	-3.4685
Wacker Master has been a city master for 31 years .	-3.4693
And he ’ s still a great deal of fun in the press talk .	-3.6345
He reports on multifaceted , but also demanding , tasks that are waiting for his successor .	-4.0020
At the same time , it wonders that so far no application has fulfilled the requirement profile .	-3.5586
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next possible time .	-12.6795
This is enough time to proceed , given the regular termination deadlines .	-4.0279
Because Haslach is the lower building authority for the administrative community , the candidate must provide the appropriate conclusions .	-5.4479
This function definitely wants to keep the city .	-2.4574
If they could no longer fill it , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.8370
But proximity to the city and to it itself is important , says Wacker , reported by a good working climate and good sentiment between the authorities and citizens .	-4.3097
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , with pride looking back on the wackers .	-4.5069
" We make the city worth living , " he is safe via the building office and his staff .	-4.4421
In the future , however , we have a number of diverse projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Hukla Areal and the Niederhofen parking space is a source of incentives .	-15.1635
The Kingbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a subject .	-3.4549
The latter alone will cost about 1.5 million euros to book when we do the right thing , " Wacker estimates .	-4.4477
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-1.8034
Work here is fun . '	-0.7806
There is a large margin for a town master .	-5.0631
With Haslach ’ s own building farm and gardening , many responses can be quite flexible .	-5.2527
" Move a lot " , according to Wacker , and the design of the green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-4.0867
Because the Old Town is considered an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to " have an eye for what matches " when new buildings are approved , the distinguishing master stresses .	-5.8946
In any case , the Municipal Master bears great responsibility .	-3.6137
He is builder , " at the end everything is going on my table " .	-3.5600
For care and coordination he can count on long-term employees : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Deep-Building ) for 15 years .	-4.5033
Wacker also wants to see his successor staying for a long time : " We are looking for someone who wants to really identify and remain " .	-5.1391
The fact is that continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further development of the city .	-3.6349
If you want to inherit Roland Wacker , you should have a degree of study as a diploma engineer or bachelor with specialist orientation architecture and have good expertise in the areas of construction and planning law .	-6.0073
The Municipal Building Office consists of high and low construction , construction planning , basic employment , urban property management , urban operating court with construction court and urban gardens as well as lower building authority including monumental protection .	-8.8355
Bicycle thrown on tracks : South Railway blocked .	-4.2012
According to the police , the perpetrators had thrown the blue bike from the train transfer in the area of Leobener Street ( B116 ) into the directions .	-15.1474
These were damaged so much that the forthcoming goods train had to be stopped .	-3.8056
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and are looking for them since the night hours .	-2.9633
A rose-coloured scooter and a bicycle rider were observed by witnesses .	-4.0379
" This goes far beyond a stroke , " said ÖBB Speaker Christoph Posch to the APA .	-4.1773
The perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and would also have jeopardised rail transport .	-3.9877
Besides the damage to the locomotives and the facility , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement transport , we could also pass on to the perpetrators of royalties by rail .	-8.1232
Overall , the speaker said it was a ' substantial ' sum .	-4.2241
The damage was rectified on Friday afternoon , rail transport on the South Railway could be carried out without disability .	-4.6622
Almost ten passenger trains were lost on Friday morning , two of them concerned remote transport .	-3.6230
Goods supplies were not available , but they were late .	-2.6850
According to EBB spokesman Christoph Posch , around 200 metres of upper lines had to be exchanged .	-2.8150
Insolators and masts have also been damaged .	-1.8043
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help to relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-2.7409
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestion system .	-1.3753
But a new study claims precisely the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate patients ’ symptoms with inflammatory diseases .	-2.4451
The intolerable state affecting about 1.3 million in the US and 300 000 in the United Kingdom causes battles and bleedings , recurrent or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.9381
While people usually get to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant darm .	-4.2058
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immuncells in the darm patrol to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in the food do not enter the body .	-3.5598
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are offset by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-2.6003
If the balance tends to be too far in the direction of inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory illness .	-3.7919
Experiments found that there is a kind of tolerance that supports immuncells in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their insiders .	-5.7351
And the bacterium requires Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-2.2101
Professor Colonna said : " We have a link between a bacterial species - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the Darm microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-2.9015
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-2.4239
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a Tryptophan rich diet promote tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal , when the same system works in humans as well .	-4.1045
The postdoctoral Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promoted tolerance when it found that a group of study mouses had such cells , but another group of the same tribes , which was housed separately , did not .	-5.1191
She suspected that the difference had to do with the mammoth robiomers - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.8484
The muzzles were sequenced by DNA and six bacteria were found in the mice with the immune cells , but without them were missing from the mice .	-4.8770
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked a darm biom and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-4.7537
To understand how the bacteria affect the immune system , researchers L. reuteri gave rise to liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to immune cells isolated by the mice .	-3.8346
Immo cells developed into tolerance promoting cells .	-3.2532
When the active component was cleaned out of liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 dairy acid .	-3.0323
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the fodder of the mice , the number of such cells increased by around 50 % , but when tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.1512
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect them in our stomach intestinal tracts .	-2.9555
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in human beings as in mice , but defects in genes related to Tryptophan have been found among people with inflammatory notice .	-11.5713
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.5754
High tryptophan values in the present of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . '	-3.6418

Jose Mourinho believes that the midfield player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening with Nemanja Matic .	-2.8277
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins Tuesday , and impressed with the owner 's role when people such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to their desires .	-4.4830
Matic , however , was excluded from the Blues preparation Asian tour and managed only 45 minutes , admitting Mourinho that he had to improve before the Prime Minister League season began .	-4.1025
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks soccer " , said Mourinho .	-1.9049
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.1342
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the start of the season .	-3.3157
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted further three new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfil three of its four priority renewal commitments . the . the of and , , and , in .	-18.9595

Boeing " paints " Dreamliner in the Heaven	-1.6874
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner in the sky .	-2.1723
The pilots flowed from Seattle in the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in the US State of Michigan and moved in the form of a dreamliner across the US , which are several thousand kilometres .	-4.3556
The promotion lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.2696
On the radar screens the shape of a Dreamliner was to be .	-2.4410
The whole thing was a endurance test for new engines .	-1.8066
Boeing had previously made such advertising .	-1.8665

New low season for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem with this problem .	-3.4611
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still the head of SPD , Social Democratic Prime Ministers always looked after Berlin before elections .	-4.3241
Only no disturbance from the central party , no headwinds from the federation - that was the most important wish of the campaigners .	-6.1394
Since Martin Schulz leads the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.0709
Since then , the Willy Brandt staff have seen with growing horrors events in the SPD governed national capitals .	-4.2332
What Schulz had received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds .	-4.9501
They were low strikes .	-2.3962
And that is one after another .	-1.9521
Following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions from SPD and Green .	-3.3066
" This once again shows : Red Green cannot simply rule reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-2.9999
The surprising exit of a Green MEP has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a severe crisis .	-20.7080
Five months before the run-up election , his red green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.3870
The Green Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the abandoned Lower Saxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-4.9900
Transition to the CDU means a clear distortion of the electoral will .	-2.1451
Elke Twestern must immediately return their mandate , " said the federal business manager and Green campaign leader to the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-4.0517
" Surely this must not be true , " a SPD campaign sees when the new Hiobs message reaches party centres on Friday morning .	-4.4895
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transition of the Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU without their own majority of government .	-4.4863
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-2.9976
And nobody knows what comes next .	-1.3691
The misery began with the unexpected significant defeat at the Saarland-election in March .	-2.9719
A blue eye , no longer , the comrades calmed themselves at the time .	-2.9206
After the national elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.0661
That became significantly worse .	-3.0223
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into a barrage , the Düsseldorf defeat slightly reversed the party .	-5.4207
The comrades strapped in the weeks afterwards .	-5.0233

Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nimbus this weekend because he was in Elbphilharmony while his city burned .	-3.3063
And because then , in crisis communication , he made quite the wrong thing , which can be done wrong .	-4.2006
Since then , pride has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.4233

The pursuit of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin was not hidden from cooperatives around Martin Schulz .	-4.0469

Beil is not in fact guilty of the internal witness of the Greens of Lower Saxon .	-4.0729
Not at all .	-2.1335
For this reason , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.8925
Their anger is geared to the Greens , and above all to the appointed parliamentarian Twestern .	-4.3305
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests over the interests of everyone else , " says Matthias Miersch , head of party party banks in the SPD Bundestagsfraction , the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-5.2091
Mrs Twestern was elected to Parliament not as a direct candidate for her person , but as a Member of the Lower Saxon Greens , the Dutch Saxon MEP continues to .	-6.1805
The logical consequence would be that it would return its mandate .	-2.0773
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Bundestagsfraction , complains an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.6885
" The electoral will was clear four years ago : people made Stephan Weil a prime minister , " said Oppermann , who leads the Dutch Saxon SPD as a leading candidate to the German election , the RND .	-4.4162

Those who want to renew their house in the years can soon receive support from the country .	-4.3594
Albert Schindler informed mayor and three representatives of STEG city development in reception on Wednesday .	-3.7454
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler reviewed what has happened so far .	-2.7985
Since 1991 , there have been receptions for renovation .	-3.6609
Back then , in the recovery area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding total .	-15.6637
In the recovery area II from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still 60 % .	-3.1832
For schindlers , the recoveries have been a " success project " - it is also important to promote interior development and not just to develop new construction areas .	-6.1776
On 4 April , the President of the Government , Karlsruhe , received information that there will be a rehabilitation area of III .	-13.3796
The funding amount is EUR 833 33 , of which 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the municipal reception .	-4.4751
How will a rehabilitation area arise ? in !	-20.6917
One will examine where the " really old " houses are .	-3.6151
However , it also has a role to play as to whether there is any interest in the planned area of restructuring .	-5.2034
If necessary , territorial borders could then again be moved .	-3.8842
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-2.0100
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Länder Programme " Social City " , in which the refurbishments would then be carried out .	-4.3356
At the heart of the programme are revitalization of inner cities , improving housing and working conditions and maintaining and developing infrastructure .	-4.0411
The measures would be implemented object-related , in other words per land .	-3.6019
The area of recovery would then be defined as a statute .	-3.5991
The granting period for funding has run from 1 January 2017 to 30 April 2026 .	-3.5354
The inventory would , however , be carried out until September this year , for the first time in which the participants will have questionnaires to fill in .	-5.7622
In November or December , the paragraph is to be adopted as soon as possible so that the rehabilitation can begin next year .	-5.9451
Pietzschmann then explained that each commune must carry out the previous investigations that were discussed .	-4.7581
It is a matter of evaluating urban maladministration and deciding when to renew and to what extent .	-4.0272
It will also be recorded in the ground book for the respective plot .	-4.8851
Pietzschmann himself will come back to receptions and make an image of the situation , promised her .	-4.2658
Gotzel stressed that the participation of the participants is an essential success factor for the project .	-3.3391
There will therefore be questionnaires which will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be filled up until the end of the summer holidays .	-3.8439
The yellow questionnaire is the " Building and Plot Arc " , which involves , among other things , the construction status and the intentions of the renovation .	-5.5607
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Housing Arc " , information about the size , division and residents of a residential area can be made . in , in , in , in in the , in in the , in . , in ,	-16.5065
The blue " Operating Arc " must only be filled out when operating in the building rooms .	-4.2480
However , it should be noted that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-3.8036
Moreover , new building measures are unable to support .	-3.9013
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of funds works according to the " Windhund principle " - who comes first , feels at first .	-4.5826
You cannot " reserve " funds for later on .	-3.1693
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were still shown to make the present a refurbishment " tasteful " .	-4.8769
British inventors themselves have a microchip to come home and car with a hand movement in their home .	-3.3857
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office , and even to start his car with a hand movement .	-4.3275
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointing fingers , and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-4.2124
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , a consultative anaesthetist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant process is carried out according to medical standards .	-4.0461
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-1.8612
Mr Northam also wants to change the castles on houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-3.3473

The White House ’ s advertising costs cost the taxpayer thousands of dollars .	-2.8559
The White House ’ s decision to fly a South Lawn marine helicopter to an event highlighting American manufacturing last month cost taxpayers up to $ 24,000 according to the military indications left to the TIME magazine .	-3.8253
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.0926
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence and senior White House officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-2.1707
The Connecticut helicopter was issued besides a yacht from maine , a fire brigade from Wisconsin and a forklift from Mississippi .	-4.4555
The White House ’ s military office required the helicopter ’ s presence in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the South Lawn helicopter landed , following the records of the Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-3.9544
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with great visibility , " the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superior , the deputy marine commander for aviation .	-4.2259
The message showed that the helicopter met the event on 17 July at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 15 a.m. and remained until the race was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-5.9031
The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second team would be required to return flight because of the limitation of service hours .	-4.3475
The original flight crew was helicopter during the event , while the security personnel remained with the aircraft during the floor .	-3.6775
The recordings provided by the TIME were not clear whether a second flight crew was required .	-3.7114
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.8245
Reads indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-2.0360
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case " , the commander wrote .	-2.7244
" When it sounds as if you are closed " , the deputy commander responded .	-3.8741
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.6410
But official events also have political upper tones .	-2.0181
During the event , the President gave an impetus to the reform of health reform underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to limit governance .	-4.6696
Use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically beneficial purposes .	-2.1921
Presidents are obliged to use them for trip .	-3.1381
But to request their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.3799
Trump carried out an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft gave rise to its first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , taxi services , and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .	-4.6025
" The White House is enthusiastic by the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 countries manufactured by American workers with American materials , " said the Deputy Secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters . , in , , in , , in , in . , , in , , ,	-14.4535
HMX-1 crews frequently run training flights in the Washington area and South Lawn to deposit US presidents in the White House with precise centimetres .	-3.6453
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , HMX-1 in the White House conducted 58 exercise landing .	-3.4814
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted on the training needs of the flight crew for the month , a civil servant said .	-3.4573
Helicopter units fly an additional 11 hours on this day for non-presidential support missions .	-3.2409
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other requirements presented at the event .	-2.5872
A spokesman of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in exhibiting the South Lawn helicopter .	-2.1950
HMX-1 doesn ’ t have budget flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-3.4486
According to US Defense Ministry hours for the 2017 fiscal year , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24.380 per flight .	-3.4486
The aircraft ’ s flight time is 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.4925
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below that rate .	-2.0530
" The cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-2.8468
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs incurred in the annual means " .	-3.0175
According to a 2015 RAND study , DoD refund rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the cost of fuel , maintenance and conclusion of the contract .	-3.2777
At this time the former White House press spokesperson , Sean Spicer , defended the event helicopter .	-3.5529
" The idea is to present things produced in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.1725
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people depend on it .	-12.5827
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.0037
It is of course appropriate to highlight this . '	-1.9446
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he took his tour through the South Lawn for the event , but he set himself in the driver 's seat of a fire car .	-4.2811
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and shocked with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-12.9513
" I know Sikorsky very well , " said the President , " I have three of them . "	-1.6821

How America Damage to OMV	-1.7785
Donald Trump was actually not happy when he signed the law on Wednesday evening to tighten sanctions against Russia .	-3.6647
" In his haste of passing the law , " Congress has packaged some " unconstitutional rules " , he later appreciated .	-5.0950

Narcos Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be placed in the hit series Netflix .	-3.7794
Despite the second season of Narcos revealed Pablo Escobars Killer , Netflix 's series is far from over .	-3.0674
The three and four seasons were already confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and showed the latest bad weights of the show .	-3.4274

On September 1 , the city of Krefeld will take care of food in the urban children 's daily facilities ( kitas ) again in its own country .	-5.9450
Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Director in the field of Youth Help , is good news : " We have all been very pleased to " .	-5.0779
Booking is still out of the home : A caterer assumes this task and delivers fresh cooking cooked .	-15.3434
The city operates 46 children 's daily activities in the Krefelder area , and in 44 children are given a warm meal at lunch time .	-4.8724
In the past kita year , 2800 children were sitting on the table , and the need continues to grow .	-4.1583
" Meanwhile , not just eating children who are served 45 hours a week , in the kita at lunch , " explains Pommerance .	-4.7632
" The offer also applies to 35-hour care when children stay until 14 p.m. "	-12.3699
From September 1 , 46 part-time workers have a kitchen service : they warm the supplied dishes , complement them with salad , raw cost and fruit , portion the meals individually , issue the meals , clean up , and clean the kitchen .	-6.8997
" The workers are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pommeranz .	-2.8954
The size - there are two groups as well as seven-group facilities - decides on the amount of hours .	-3.9971
" The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the kita team " , says Pommerance satisfied .	-3.1247
" So they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts for the kital-management . "	-4.5424
Because it is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking education .	-3.7355
" Children should help to prepare food " .	-1.8733
The direct connection of the kitchen power to the team makes sense .	-3.0473
For children too .	-2.2694
" They have a known force in the kita , a person familiar with them , and not always changing people " .	-3.2721
This continuity is important for children .	-1.0746
The cleaning of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be carried out by special cleaning staff in the future . , too .	-18.0789
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - has , in addition to improving the quality of the kitchen performance , also the charm it emerged as the most economical in the cost comparison between own governments and foreign exchange for the city , namely from the press office .	-7.6787
And this , despite the fact that 46 part-time forces are re-op.	-4.0917

GMB anxiety about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-1.7124
A trade union wants to be assured by managers of the Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .	-3.7114
GMB Scotland said that the company has remained silent about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-2.8450
More than 500 employees work in the plant , which produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse as well as other products .	-3.6349
McVities owner Pladis said that he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-14.5602
He added that employees and trade union representatives would " learn as the first " if their activities changed .	-2.7507
In a letter to the company 's branch manager , GMB Scotland McVitie 's urged " Remember that funding for modernizing production lines would not be advanced " .	-3.8955
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tolcross is deeply concerned by our members .	-3.3854
Here , generations of families have worked and the workforce focuses strongly on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-4.6922
Therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , the rising cost of living and chronic production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie .	-4.1806
A spokesperson from Pladis said : " Tollcross ’ s branch manager received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly because we appreciate the continued commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-4.4024
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-13.9015
We discussed with employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , we continually reviewed our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-4.6167
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.5094
We fully recognise the legacy of Tollcross as a manufacturing facility , and if our operations change at the location , employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this .	-15.8763

The site of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.3540
Paris Saint-Germain is not going to leave in her persecution of Neymar after granting an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the World Cord ?	-4.6760

But was the football world warned three years ago by the PSG President of this prospect ?	-2.3418
When Manchester City declared interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best PSG players .	-3.3820
" I am not worried because they know that when they touch one of our players , we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.1055
" We respect all clubs .	-1.1055
But if they try to sign one of our players , that will have consequences . '	-3.2822
Barcelona seems to have crossed this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG midfield player Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-3.3270

The police are now asking for the incident and the driver of the polluter vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under tel 05761 / 92060 .	-4.3107
Interview : ' Dompatzen report relieves Papst brother Georg Ratzinger '	-2.6543
The Regensburg Dompatzen report on abuse cases relieves Papst Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.6473
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.6216
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg dompatzes continues to provide discussion .	-3.8544
Christian Weisnder , speaker of the reform movement " We are Church " , explained after publication of the German Press Agency , he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93 year brother of the emerged Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.2509
It would serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of the transactions at the time .	-4.8810
The " Osservatore Romano " Vatican newspaper , on the other hand , criticised the " double standard " of reporting on violence in dompatces .	-5.2139
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , no one doubts that these are ' shameful and shameful acts ' , which should be penalised and prevented in the future , but striking is the ' degree of medial manipulation ' , as the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Bioethics Committee .	-5.3470
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it normal " , says Scaraffia .	-4.0026
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis also said in the interview with the Bavarian radio : " You are happy to go to the church and that is a fantastic journey " .	-5.5463
Moreover , she pointed out that in her youth ' shots were a completely normal pedagogical means ' to deal with cheerful children , as I was one thing , ' .	-6.1020
They would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.3944
Pope brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared in connection with reports on abuse .	-3.1817
By wrong , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who with Ratzinger writes the band " My Brother of the Pope " ( translated in 12 languages ) .	-4.1624
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he values the results of the final report .	-3.5645
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer responsible for the Enlightenment by the Bistum Regensburg ?	-3.2851
In total 547 Regensburg dompatzes were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 dompatzes .	-4.3774
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " In other words , it can be stated that in many cases , physical and mental violence have been applied by Domkapellmeister R. .	-13.4509
Especially at a high level of emotionality , punishment for students could also be more severe .	-13.5352
Nevertheless , contrary to many other accusers , many victims estimated the general humanity of R and , in many cases , even combine positive memories with it , despite violence .	-15.4574
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal discharges at the Regensburg Dompatzen Georg Ratzinger .	-4.0089
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' circumstances of violence exercise in the shelters of the Regensburger Dompatzen ' shows a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-5.1910
First , many pupils highlight their " humanity " .	-3.0283
On the other hand , it also appears as a choleric and perfectionist who became more often handful of the dompatch when a musical dome did not produce top performance .	-6.3782
How do you use this final report as your biograph ?	-2.8565
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages report from the front to the back , you have to ask more about why the name Georg Ratzinger is there .	-5.2889
He is dedicated to eight pages and is clearly freed from any suspicion of mid-term or co-wisdom in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.5094
Violence in advance school also occurred outside its sphere of effectiveness .	-3.6703
If anything , he can be accused of being too late or of not taking first suggestions seriously enough .	-4.4724
The Dompatzengymnasium on which he worked was found by virtually all the surveys as - so literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-4.3033
The vast majority of his pupils Georg Ratzinger also expresses an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understandable " , as an extremely good teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always converted by grapes of children " .	-5.6397
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which also led to shameful outbreaks .	-4.4993
He deeply regrets and apologizes for the fact that he spread the ear couple not only with chairs and threw the keys into the ground , but also the ear couples , and took excessively cheerful boys to the hairs or ears , as early , in . , in , , in , , in , , , with , in , , ,	-20.7153
In his honour salvation , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents like teachers .	-4.9342
Do you know any other breeding methods ?	-2.0571
Of course , I think everyone of us born before 1968 .	-2.4077
I also experienced it in a secular school , a state gymnasium .	-2.3947
Compared to what is actually at stake in this report , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence in advance school , these are , of course , bags .	-5.6762
It ’ s already asking whether it ’ s not more to do with his familiarity and role as brother of Benedict XVI , that many media plunged on him .	-7.2120
Many people who have never understood it are still working diligently on the Bavarian Pope .	-3.7013
The truth is , however , that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-2.2713
Much has been said in the media in connection with the report on abuse in the Regensburg dompatces .	-3.7012
Will Georg Ratzinger burden any involvement or participation in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-2.8709
Michael Hesemann : Of course no .	-10.6709
No one of the 67 victims of sexual assertions claims to have entrusted themselves to the master domain .	-3.2131
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-1.5666
" I never knew to talk to my father or my mother about it , " said one person vice-representing for others , " It was all very embarrassing to me .	-15.4829
The real problem in educating sexual abuse has been and is that most victims are silent .	-3.1899
If they do not even entrust parents and wisters , it is certainly not a choir leader who would have been a member of the perpetrators in the professional sense .	-5.6358
How do the students assess Ratzinger 's role in cases of abuse ?	-13.4034
Michael Hesemann : A surveyed student put it : " I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had received timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-15.3455
I think it is really absurd to assume that he is calculated ... Burns of impressive or clear or even more have opened than against their parents , boarding managers , trust teachers etc .	-6.2269
That he talks about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.1865
The report reaches the very clear result : ' The entrustment of students and / or their surroundings in advance could not be confirmed as part of the investigation ' .	-5.4113
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of any co-knowledge .	-4.2874
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented him or displayed it .	-3.5894
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these unfortunate crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.6817
There was a lot to read in the media about " violent excesses " at the Regensburg dompatzes .	-4.5598
The former Georg Ratzinger dom-chapel member is accused of being shown in the report on ' Way ' .	-6.1420
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-1.5554
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that the reporting mixed everything and concealed it into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of Georg Ratzinger .	-4.3657
But that , in turn , is an abuse of the report .	-2.3841
The fact is that there is clean separation between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the dome patches , between sexual abuse and violence excesses and , let us say , other accusations .	-6.3431
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , including four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the choir of the dompatches .	-4.9952
All the terrible test tests , the cases in which ranks of sadistic teachers were regularly harassed and maltreated and suffered appallingly , all took place at Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions had to prevail .	-6.8575
But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with him , because he was given the boys only to face when they were already on the dompatzengymnasium .	-5.2762
On the subject of " Pre-School " , as most witnesses emphasised , the subject was taboo .	-3.6815
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed the much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-12.8951
What was different from the dompatzengymnasium ?	-3.4087
Michael Hesemann : While there was discipline , there was no sadistic violence .	-2.3803
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims estimate the general humanity of R. R. R. R. R. Because in many cases , despite violence , they even share positive memories with it ' .	-17.3775
At most , the accusation remains that they have disappeared .	-4.1499
Yet , despite all the efforts , the report was able to define only two periods in which it was reported by the pre-school conditions .	-4.3991
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself , and from what he was doing at a school where he was not actually responsible and responsible ( so the witness ) wanted to hear nothing , and then again in 1993 .	-5.9696
Do Georg Ratzinger closed the ears consistently before the conditions ?	-3.5979
Michael Hesemann : No , since since 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Dompatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-2.8799
He points out to them that ' previous school continues to practice the practice of the practice of the penalty " . the was , in , , in , . the ,	-13.6148
He recommended urgent intervention , given the danger of negative press releases .	-2.3293
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when audit penalties were long banned in Bavaria .	-5.3269
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as all of us are well aware .	-3.0988
It was difficult for him , too , to assess where perhaps the parties were excessive or dramatized and where the permissible limit had really been exceeded .	-5.9864
Nor can we say that he would always have been watched away .	-3.6063
That is simply not true .	-0.5565
Only in 1980 was the cancellation of schools officially abolished in Bavaria .	-2.4894
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn und Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical standards to the time .	-3.9011
How do you see this ?	-1.2658
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the " fallstrick of anachronism " , that is , the danger of evaluating past moral standards .	-4.1673
The Principality is quite right .	-2.6821
Of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was disgusting at all times , nor to what was violated in the previous school of resistance and violence in innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond the customary .	-5.8576
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being dealt with .	-3.2391
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.7340
His means of discipline and punishment , i.e. to pull ears and ears , were widespread in the 1970 ’ s .	-4.9523
When physical punishment was then prohibited , he also kept strictly in mind .	-4.3137
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reflected in the talks with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-3.1473
Will the issue of crushing penalties also be ? the , , , , and , , with . , ,	-11.5438
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , i.e. Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , since the dompatches played only a side role .	-3.7913
Nonetheless , I do not remain silent about the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.7428
But this also needs to be said : without this perfectionism , without the demand of a discipline , it would have been hard to draw a institution of world-class Regensburg dompatces until then , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went twice in the United States ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) on tourney .	-7.4517
Kekens and Bonbons alone do not make any major singers or any success , but discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-6.8174
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger in the talks about her book ?	-3.7034
Michael Hesemann : Through work on the book and beyond , I have really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and experienced time and time again as a wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deep faithful and heartfelt people , who cannot imagine that he could only do something to a fly .	-7.2039
I periodically get contact with how many former dompatches still today , 23 years after their emergence , visit him , read him out - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-5.5817
Those who have not yet forgiven him that he was strict to them are therefore clearly in the minority .	-3.9624
Most domspatzes are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them close to the world of music .	-3.3217
And that he was always a good , father ’ s teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but was also a lovely respectsperson to which they are still watching and worshipping .	-6.7003
I would like to make it quite clear , once again , that everything one accuses him of is educational methods that were on the agenda at the time .	-5.3303
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-2.1253
But it is extremely unfair , a man just because he is celebrating and having an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat .	-20.5183
There is all too obvious the evil intention behind it .	-2.1890
Because the report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.1067
Now the prosperity would be a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merits and would not be familiar with the Regensburg dompatces in peace without the outside Bavaria and perhaps even in Germany .	-6.9056
