While the tsunami conservation rooms were built in Aceh , what is not normal for other coastal lines .	-13.8225

The question on the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-13.1565

" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to take the heads up , not through the service , " said Kavadarkov .	-2.9947
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.1997
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.9709
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-1.9074

The Rockies secured at least one place on Friday evening with a 5 : 2 victory , but the title win in the first league is still not safe .	-4.4734

Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meetings on Friday evening were exactly the same .	-2.9731
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a more " more friendly , soft " policy has long been forgotten if it has ever begun .	-4.0710
It has become increasingly clear that differences of opinion in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion will be judged on whether it is acceptable for party leadership .	-4.3183
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s commencement of office , because my colleagues , with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude , expected me to take a turnaround and take positions that I would never have agreed with , be it in relation to national security or the internal EU market .	-6.5010
Whenever I speak in public – and it does not matter what I am saying – a tirade of abuse in the social media calling for elections is denounced by the Centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-5.5945

Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s Captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak figures , and Jason Baggot to recover an unchanged attempt .	-4.3065
Climo was the leader of Ayr with a punishment before he arrived directly at mid-term hit and then made a solo request to get him into the 17 : 5 punishment for Ayr .	-8.0760

With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , seek to offer their students the best service level .	-2.7183
Independent schools are aimed at preparing students – for further education , including at universities , professional careers and their role as global citizens .	-3.8374
In the educational sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , in which we note that modern languages in schools are still popular and desired .	-3.6832
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ When you talk to a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-2.5168

This illustrates impressively that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we want to build relations and trust with people from other countries .	-2.9439
The audit results of this year show that languages lead the tables with the highest levels of existence in independent schools .	-2.6650
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached higher classes A .	-3.1431

This shows that independent schools in Scotland will promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-2.7861
Language subjects have the same rank in independent schools and elsewhere as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , natural science , and technology ) .	-3.3393
A 2014 British Employment and Qualifications survey revealed that 17 % of the reasons for which employers had difficulties in occupying free jobs were attributed to a lack of language knowledge .	-4.0572

Trump ’ s Rallye in West Virginia , YouTube Channel	-1.3377
President Donald Trump is beginning this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.1176
His tour also visits the Republican-friendly states Tennessee and Mississippi .	-3.1372
While his candidate remains outstanding for the vacant place on the Supreme Court , Trump must mobilise his electorate for the forthcoming midterm elections , otherwise fear that the Republicans will lose the majority of the Congress when elected in November .	-4.5767
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye tonight and how to view them online ?	-2.7263
Trump 's Rallye in Wheeling , West Virginia is scheduled for 7 p.m. ET this evening , Saturday , 29 September 2018 .	-3.0892
You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye online by live stream on YouTube .	-2.2058
Trump will certainly take up this week ’ s hearings on the charges of sexual abuse against his candidates for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , and the Senate ’ s confirmation has been postponed by at least a week before the FBI investigations are completed .	-5.5312
However , the main aim of these electoral events is to mobilise the Republicans , who are facing a decisive election in November .	-3.5462
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilise volunteers and supporters next week with the five electoral events to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-3.0824
“ The majority in Congress is at the president ’ s agenda , so he visits as many states as possible shortly before the turbulent election campaign began , ” a Trump campaign spokesperson who wants to not be named , Reuters said .	-6.4879
According to West Virginia MetroNews radio network , the electoral evening at Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract Pittsburgher media attention .	-3.6740
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the federal state that he won over 40 percentage points in 2016 , will be visiting this month for the second time .	-2.9260
Trump is trying to help Republicans ’ candidate for the West Virginia Senate , Patrick Morrisey , who lags behind polls .	-2.2986
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , politologist at West Virginia University , said that it is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to improve his surveys .	-2.7640
Ryder Cup 2018 : The Team USA is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday singles .	-3.1574
After three unilateral encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon probably were exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.6162
The swing pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that the players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-3.9726
So where would they say the dynamics now ?	-1.6604
“ You had a six-point lead , now there are four , so it seems to us a little momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew himself for the day . ”	-3.8968
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of 4 points , to play 12 more .	-3.8061
The Americans , as Spieth says , feel slightly wind in their sails , and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have played together all the day and each with three of four points .	-4.7629
Spieth had considered it from the beginning and set a good example .	-16.1389
These calamitous cry became louder when his round continued , he dropped a decisive putt to reach a difference in play 4 after he and Thomas withdrew 2 points after 2 matches .	-6.2496
His joy over the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was such that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-3.8313
" You really have to concentrate you and only worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.2515
This is also everything that each of these players remain .	-4.3062
18 holes to leave an impression .	-0.9827
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.8331
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple is playing wrong and simply doing everything right .	-15.9970
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not obtain a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-17.1049
This course and the way in which its energy seems to be flowing from this unleashed spectator , makes it favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes down via Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who seales a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-5.9480
Both probably simultaneously at different holes .	-2.8513
To talk of European victory now would be too premature .	-2.6009
Bubba Watson and Web Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.7216
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine , the Spaniards and the Swede died into a hole from which they never came out again .	-3.7505
On Sunday , however , there is no one who helps you out of your hole .	-2.1110
Due to the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change in its hands , it is very fascinating to see the fourballs and foursomes from close proximity .	-5.4723
Europe , as a team , has played better and has taken on a clear lead over the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the Team USA has the desire to fight , as some , particularly stateside , have doubted .	-5.4253
Europe is running 10-6 at the Ryder Cup Final Day	-1.7939
Europe will take a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-3.2759
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting tiger woods to bring their previous balance to four points in the Le Golf National .	-3.8118
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took over the preservation of the trophy that it lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team fighting with suspenders , and won the series 3-1 .	-4.7815
The US offered more resistance to the fans , and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-3.2251
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 singles from Sunday to keep the trophy .	-3.0209
Fleetwood is the first European rookie that wins four points as a result , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called Molliwood , are only the second couple who wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.6626
After dismantling Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourball , it was assured that they would beat a sobered woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.5345
Woods , who died on Saturday through two games , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four balls and four , and seven followed .	-18.8672
Justin Rose , rested for tomorrow ’ s fourball , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and suggested in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-3.7498
On a pleasant , airy day south-west of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-1.9294
The three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-2.5863
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourth pack and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the fourth pack after they lost the first two holes .	-3.2480
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team returns to the single from a four-point deficit , even though Halter Furyk 's page only needs a drawback to keep the trophy .	-5.3112
After two days of second best-season , however , a Sunday accounter looks like he would go bey.	-4.2676
North Korea says that , “ by no means ” , there will be a unilateral disarmament without confidence .	-3.1925
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that in no circumstances would the country abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally .	-3.2158
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World body that last year North Korea took ' major Goodwill measures ' , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear test area and the obligation to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.0294
" But there is no such answer from the USA , " he said .	-1.9173
“ Without any confidence in the US there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances , there is no way we disarm ourselves first unilaterally . ”	-3.0959
Whereas Ri resumed the famous North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization that North Korea would reward with gradual steps , its declaration seemed significant to the extent that it did not completely reject one-sided denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.7418
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to working towards ' denuclearizing the Korean peninsula ' , while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-3.9331
North Korea sought a formal end of the Korean war in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first .	-11.7585
Washington has also opposed demands for a relaxation of the hard international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.4986
The US insists on ' denuclearization-first ' and increase pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in an obligatory way , and even reject the ' declaration of the end of the war ' , Ri said .	-4.3628
" The perception that sanctions can force us to knee is a dream of people who are ignorant of us .	-2.4611
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-1.4557
Ri did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President stressed at the United Nations at the beginning of the week .	-2.6565
Instead , the minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months and added : ' If the party were to be denuclearizing South Korea and not the US , the denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula would not have gone into such a dead ' .	-5.2795
Nonetheless , Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly , which targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s rocket , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called the “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.8815
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ destroy North Korea completely , ” has praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that a great deal of work still had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed the denuclearization .	-4.4008
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-2.8290
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council , Pyongyang , should reward the steps taken .	-1.7685
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , the UN said on Thursday that ' the enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without continuation of deficit until we implement the complete , final and verified denuclearisation ' .	-4.6390
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the financing of nuclear and ballistic missile programmes in Pyongyang .	-2.7903
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he will return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.9193
Pompeo visited North Korea this year already three times , but his last trip didn ’ t go well .	-12.4287
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress has been made , and only a few hours later condemned North Korea to “ slow ” demands .	-4.3399
In a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile location and also a nuclear complex when the United States adopts ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.0009
He said Kim told him that the ' relevant measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-2.6290
Harvard students participate in the course to find enough tranquillity .	-2.9860
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students are given more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of the study of coffee-composed nights .	-3.7986
A scientist has noted that students at a world leading university are often unsuspected of helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.4832
Charles Charles Cheisler , professor of sleeping medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the US .	-3.8512
He was inspired to start the course after holding a lecture on the impact of sleeping deficiency on learning .	-3.6060
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why are they told me only now , in my final year ?	-4.2211
She said that you have never heard of the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he told the telegraph .	-3.2760
The course offered for the first time this year explains the basics of students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general .	-3.7165
Paul Barreira , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health Service of the University , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-4.1995
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.9649
In one section there is a picture of a sleeping room where students click on coffee masses , texts , coaches and books to be informed about the effects of coffin and light and how to influence the sporting performance by sleeping shortages and the meaning of a sleep time routine .	-6.4642
Another section explains to participants how to increase the risk of heart infection , stroke , depression , and cancer for long-term sleep trav.	-4.7395
A card of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their everyday life .	-2.3405
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-1.9086
" But we believe that they have a right to it - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Czigaretter added .	-3.2872
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on pupils and students turns out to be a growing problem .	-3.4226
Enough sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to fight stress , exhaustion , and fear , he said - even to not accept , as sleeping hunger places the brain in hunger mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-5.7260
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he visited one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-3.6724
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push him into a campus-wide course . , and , , . the , , , , the , , . the	-13.9309
The next step , he hopes , is to ask all doctoral candidates to complete a similar study program before entering the Competition University .	-2.7176
Prof. Czeisler recommended students to alert them when they go into bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast from electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circadian rhythm out of action , causing problems in the fall .	-6.4568
Livington 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal gets Gerrards men	-12.6538
Further foreign problems of the Rangers : After a meeting by Dolly Menga , the 1-to-0 defeat for the unique Steven Gerrard team came to Livington .	-5.1893
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since February 4 : 1 triumph in St. Johnstone , but Gary Holt ’ s team added Gerrards ’ second defeat in 18 games as trainer who left his team behind the disappointed Ladbrokes Premiership chief Hearts .	-5.1382
Menga landed seven minutes before the mid-term a hit and an inspirational rankings did not look like a balance .	-4.5418
While the Rangers are now falling back to the sixth place , Livington climb to rank three and are only behind Hibernian because of the gate difference .	-5.3173
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , as Calum Spence has had to be given a headscarf to Calum Spence after being hit by a litter – apparently thrown out of the foreign fans sector .	-7.9787
Gerrard made eight shifts to the side of Ayr , pushing directly into the Betfred Cup semifinal .	-4.3592
Holt , on the other hand , created the same Livi Elf that diminished the heart last week , and he may have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team left the opponents at no time for action .	-6.5002
The Rangers dominated the ball ’ s possession , but Livington did better .	-5.7863
You should only have met after two minutes when Menga 's first Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregors Gate , but the midfielder left his big chance at the gate .	-5.4288
Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow was only able to shoot far in the direction of rear posts .	-3.6195
The ranks took control , but there seemed to be more hope than to give betrayals to their own game , in the last third .	-5.2708
Alfredo Morelos clearly believed , after the first quarter of hours , that he had earned an elfmeter after collecting and Steven Lawless , but Steven Thomson referee did not appeal to the Colombian .	-5.4341
The Rangers are just two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox gorgeon Liam Kelly was hardly at Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and the hit of a bissless Ovie Ejaria .	-6.1578
Even though Livi ’ s opening meeting might have been contrary to the game ’ s course in the 34th minute , no one can deny that they deserve it for their efforts alone .	-5.6173
Again , the ranks failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-1.4147
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that saved calm and picked up Menga for a simple finish .	-3.0910
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent , and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-4.2087
But Livington continually moved the guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett crushing long balls after long balls .	-14.6230
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership in the final stage , but McGregor stood well to refuse Jacobs before heading from the corner .	-4.9650
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to a penalty because he hampered himself with Jacobs , but once again he saw Thomson shouting .	-4.8247
Almanah : The Innovator of the Geiger Counter	-2.0518
And now a page from our almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day on which the future physicist John Wilhelm , known as Hans , Geiger was born in Germany .	-3.3957
Figer developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the known device as a counter .	-3.9637
Since then , the giant counter has become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950 ’ s of the movie " Bells of Coronado " , which appears to have unlikely cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-5.1330
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-1.6895
Rogers : “ It is a counter used to find radioactive minerals like Uran .	-2.4398
When you raise these headphones , you can indeed listen to the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals . ”	-17.6437
Evans : “ Say , but now it cracks enormous ! ”	-3.0871
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , only a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.6051
But the invention bearing its name continues to be used .	-1.6644
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to “ see ” malicious cells .	-1.4652
New cancer vaccines can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malicious cells .	-1.5515
Vaccine teaches the immune system to identify malicious cells as part of the treatment .	-2.1496
The process involves the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of the laboratory .	-3.7639
You can then see a protein that is common to many cancers and then re-inject .	-3.1673
A study vaccine shows promising results for patients with a number of cancers .	-2.1266
A woman treated with the vaccine , which teaches the immune system to identify rogue cells , saw her egg cancer disappeared for more than 18 months .	-2.9313
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many cancers , and then inject the cells again .	-3.9564
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine ' .	-2.5748
HER2 “ promotes the growth of different types of cancer , ” including breast , egg , lung and die cancer , explained Berzofsky .	-3.3347
A similar approach to seeing patients immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-3.2569
After his appearance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , clothed with MAGA-Mutte , a pro-Trump tirade from the stack .	-5.0367

Kanye West was born in the studio during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after a speech in which he praised the US , President Donald Trump , and said he would take 2020 .	-5.6508
After listening to his third song of night , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great Mütze , he raised the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.1888
" So often I speak with a white person , and she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.1758
Well , if I was concerned about racism , I would have been extended from America long ago , " he said .	-2.9583
The Saturday Night Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood Star Matt Damon , via Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement to the Senate Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Fords accusations that Kavanaugh needed sexually , made her funny .	-15.1632
Although it was not broadcast , Wests Schwetz 's film material was divided into social media by Komiker Chris Rock .	-4.1974
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post .	-2.1767
West , too , complained to the audience that he had had found it difficult behind the stage , because of his head cover .	-3.6293
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.9109
They said : ' Do not get rid of the hat ' .	-3.1405
You annoyed me !	-1.1877
And then they say I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.3691
West went on : " Do you want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would attract " my Superman context , because that means that you can 't tell me what I should do , you want the world to go ahead ?	-6.3891
“ Don ’ t try with love . ” .	-10.3882
His comments were quoted at least twice by the audience , and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to be displaced , reported Variety and quoted one person in the words : “ The whole studio was total . ”	-4.9937
West was used as a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-2.5480
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , as Perrier Bottle .	-14.0393
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who twittered : “ This is for one of the most courageous spirits : DANKE , DASS DU DICH DER MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . ”	-3.5691
But Talkmasterin Karen Hunter twitterte , that West is simply " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-3.8637

According to reports published , US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as US Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both of which come from Utah .	-3.8235
The information appeared online , posted by an unknown person on the capitol hill during a consultation of the Senate on the accusations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.7094
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey by Kavanaugh .	-11.1346
Conservative websites such as Gateway Punit and RedState reported that the IP address that identified the source of the jobs was related to Waters ' Office and published the information of an employee of Waters reports Hill .	-4.7104
“ This unfounded accusation is totally wrong and an absolute lie , ” Water continues .	-2.1763
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were impaired as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the information being made available .	-4.5595
This untenable claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.4260
Water ’ s statement quickly led to criticism online , including the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-3.1484
“ The denial of the matter is extremely annoying , ” wrote meat .	-3.1530
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a congressional member .	-2.3987
If someone is accused of having done something , he cannot be evil .	-2.3023
They must not be silent .	-2.3635
You must not question the plaintiff 's motives .	-1.9808
They must be calm and left . ”	-2.0570
Meat seemed to compare Water ’ s reaction to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh accused of critics of appearing angry during the hearing on Thursday .	-3.9191
Also Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ran in the mid-term elections next to the seatless Water , expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-3.5794
Big , if true , he has tweeted .	-1.6465
In its statement , Waters said that their office ' has informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-3.3730

Review of " Johnny English – One lives only triple " – poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.8412
It is tradition to look for suggestions in any new film with Brexit tendency , and this seems to be a revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy-Spoof franchise .	-34.9168
Is the Ironian self-satire about the abyss of humanity the new possibility of exporting the nation ?	-3.1529
His name shows that he is a comic creation with great reach , designed for non-English-speaking cinemas screens . in , , in , , in , , in , , in . , in , , in , , in , , in , , , , in	-26.4892
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent , who , despite his bizarre claims of smoothie-glamour , has received a little Clouseau , a splash Mr. Bean and a clack from this guide , has contributed a single touch to the guiding melody of fire vehicles at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-7.2473
It is also based on travellers and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once participated in the now forgotten Barclaycard television indications , always leaving chaos behind .	-4.4319
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.4045
I loved Johnny English , who is close to a helicopter in a medieval armor and the main rotor beats briefly against his helmet .	-3.5998
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange unnecessary , especially as the " serious " movie brands like 007 and mission Impossible self-confidently offer comedy as an ingredient .	-4.0510
Humor feels as if he is more directed at children than at adults , and for me the crazy missent of Johnny English is not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean films .	-13.6196
The permanent premise now is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.3649
A cyber hacker has filtered the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to horror the service agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.3814
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May figure , but there is not much in the script that can work with .	-4.1085
Their intelligence advisers inform that as each individual active spy has been compromised , they have to get someone out of retirement .	-3.9846
And that means that the wonderful Johnny English himself , who is now a school master in a noble institution but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a Rock Academy about Spionage .	-5.6902
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency letter and reunited with his former , long-suffering Kumpel Bough , played again by Ben Miller .	-2.9462
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overwhelming , burschicous role in which Vicki Pepperdine does not fully assert .	-4.6531
So the Batman and Robin des Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-2.9472
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously on the bann of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve the UK ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.6956
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the colourful highjinks : as a cellar , they influence a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas Luxusyacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tried to familiarize himself with a Virtual Reality Headset with the inside of Volta 's house .	-5.7842
For this last sequence , all registers have certainly been drawn , but so kindly and leaving them out , the whole thing reminds us of children 's television .	-6.4407
Of course .	-1.9200
And , as with the other Johnny English films , I could not fail to think : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that is really fair to his talent ?	-4.5571
Labour disputes having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week , for which five days are paid .	-2.8198
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan , with British working only four days a week but paid for five .	-3.6155
According to reports , the party wants business leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the revolution of artificial intelligence ( AI ) to the workers by releasing them an additional day .	-3.7595
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money home .	-2.7974
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the economic agenda of the party and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers .	-3.3618
The trade union Congress has approved the shift to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing economy .	-3.6183
A high-level source of the Labour Party said Sunday Times : a review of politics is likely to be announced before the end of the year .	-12.4548
A four-day week is a goal that matches the Party ’ s approach to restoring economic balance to workers and the Party ’ s general industrial strategy , but this goal will not be realised overnight .	-4.0684
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign .	-2.3747
However , the whole Labour Party currently does not support this initiative .	-3.0102
A Labour Party spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.6160
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to concrete his vision of a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.5721
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit-makers ' among utilities .	-2.2243
The shadow chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not return their entire share , since a Labour Government could make ' deductions ' caused by alleged misconduct .	-5.6134

Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their minds .	-2.5283
Due to a ongoing FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on the appointment of the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week , and the question is also being raised as to whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead to Republican senators to give up their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.4656
In an interview conferred on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 Minutes , ” questioned the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham as to whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could move them to change their opinion .	-4.7661
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.6732
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-0.8547
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.7905
I called him after this assertion came out , I said , ' Have you done it ? '	-3.7361
He was determined , targeted , unequivocal . '	-1.7177
Graham 's voice seemed to be in stone .	-2.3745
" I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb accusation , " he said .	-2.7748
" Dr. Ford , I do not know what happened , but I know that Borett has strongly disputed the accusation , " added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.4427
" No one who called them could confirm it .	-1.2775

But how successful has Global Citizens been to reach their goal at 12 remaining years ?	-2.8106
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a genuine opportunity to convince people to demand an appeal for action , or simply another case of so-called ' clicktivism ' - people who feel like sending a tweet by signing an online petition or an online application or by sending a tweet as if they would make a real difference ?	-5.4278
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , more than 19 million “ actions ” have been noted by his supporters , who have pressed for a variety of different goals .	-5.0110

“ With support from the British Government , donors , other state governments and global Citizens like you can make sure that the social injustice of malnutrition is a story , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.1558
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom , which decreased to improve the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will reach the financing of the project " Power of Nutrition " 5 million women and children with food interventions .	-4.6511
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website : “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.7955
Global citizens replied : a long and difficult way - sometimes we will fail and fail .	-2.9446
Like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements ahead , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-2.5794

Zincke spoke to the participants of a Consumer Energy Alliance event , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.4905
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , and found that they are actually the same .	-2.5792
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less in using and replacing fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-3.2846
The opinions come , while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia , which is much more favourable for European consumers .	-28.2374

American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he will have to drastically improve his shape , not become a sad milestone .	-4.6883
Mickelson , played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was set to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-4.4520
Instead of focusing , as is so often the case for the US , the fivefold major winner divided his day between fires and rounds of exercise in the Gulf , in the hope of overcoming his depth .	-4.5964
Even at the height of his career , the 48-year-old is never the straightest driver , and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square where the long Rough punishes failures regularly .	-4.2574
And as if the place alone would not be enough , Mickelson meets in the ninth match on Sunday the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-4.5935
If Americans launch four points and have a hot start when 12 individual games start , Mickelsons Match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.2167
Furyk expressed his trust in his husband ; that also left him another .	-2.8077
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a slap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.3502
" He has a lot of confidence .	-2.0863
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-1.6944

Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great advance at the Ryder Cup last day can quickly become an uncomfortable night .	-4.1130
The Dane debuted in 1997 in the game in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only scarcely reached the target line and won with a thin advance of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-5.5054
" One reminds us that one was in the leadership of Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost ; and in Valderrama we won , but only scarcely , " said Bjorn , after watching the Class of 2018 , now leading with 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday at 5-3 victory .	-6.0665
History will show me and all in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.1819

It is only over when the points on the table are displayed .	-3.1867
Our goal is to win this cup , and this is what we are focusing on .	-2.8308
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.4988
As his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I '. , , , I 'd never be premature .	-6.1005
Tomorrow is another day .	-1.5698
Tomorrow are the personal performances , and that is another matter .	-2.3548
It ’ s great to be out there with a partner when things go well , but if you ’ re out alone , your skills as golf players will be tested on the whole .	-5.1183
That is the message you must convey to the players : to get the best out tomorrow .	-3.2094
Now you get over to your partner and you need to make exactly what you are doing . ”	-4.4442
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will seek to make his players do better than partners , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have taken three out of four points .	-4.9380
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn at the end of the day when he was part of the victor team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team finished the “ miracle of Medinah . ”	-5.7006
" I remember every doomed word , " he said about how Ben Crenshaw , the Captain of 1999 , had assembled his players on the way in the last day .	-3.7111
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to get started as soon as possible , as you have seen in Brookline , Medinah .	-3.1980
Once an own dynamic has developed , the pressure is on middle matches .	-4.6246
We have built our production accordingly and brought out the boys as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-4.4100
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , should lead the other European in the upper squares of the ranking , the counterfeit against Rory McIlroy in the top game .	-5.2797

Replacing the timetable for Germany ’ s New War Ship	-3.1177
As early as 2014 , the German Navy ’ s most recent frigates should have been put in service to replace Cold War vessels that arrived in the years , but that will take place at least until next year , owing to faulty systems and escalating costs .	-7.6393
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the leading ship of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , the newspaper “ The Time ” appealed on a military speaker .	-5.1362
The Marine should have started the ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery burdened the ambitious project .	-3.2024
The four Baden-Württemberg class fregates ordered by the Marine in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-17.4587
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of anti-air and shipping missiles , as well as some stealth-technology , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-3.8769
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest freights are to be used for up to two years without running home .	-4.3535
But the state-of-the-art warships that Germany should enable overseas power projections will already be outdated if they are finally put at service , as the weekly “ Time ” notes .	-5.2448
The unhappy F125 fregate caused headlines last year , when the German naval officially refused to start the ship , and returned to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-3.8104
This was the first time that the Marine returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery .	-3.0140
The reasons for returning the vessels were little known ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make warships useless in combat missions .	-4.4250
Software shortcomings were particularly important as the Baden-Württemberg class ships are served by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half of the occupation on older Bremen class fregates .	-4.1494
It also turned out that the ship had considerable overweight , limiting performance and making future upgrades more difficult for the navy .	-4.2303
It is assumed that the 7,000 tonnes of Rhineland-Palatinate are twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II .	-3.6946
Besides faulty hardware , the price sign of the entire project , including the training of the crew , is also on the subject .	-4.2280
Instead of the originally estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the cost now seems to have reached the diminishing level of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-2.9662
The problems with the latest freights are particularly important , in the light of recent warnings , for Germany ’ s sea slump to be diminished .	-5.3929
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , allowed the war fleet to do “ the operational vessels . ”	-3.7928
The official said that the problem has grown avalanche over time , as old ships have been removed from service without replacing it .	-4.4752
He complained that neither Baden-Württemberg fregates were put to service by the Marine .	-11.6298
The National Trust illuminates the secret life of bad mouses .	-3.0267
New research in a property in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to find out how bathers use the landscape for food search .	-4.1339
It is hoped that this will bring new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals , which will provide guidance for future measures to protect animals .	-4.8381
The study by National Trust for Scotland scientists will follow the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross as well as brown and durable bathrobes in the In. Gard.	-31.8944
Special reception devices are placed on the main points of the accommodation to track bathing activities throughout the season .	-4.2186

Rob Dewar , Nature Consultant at the National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out what areas of life are the most important for the bathing mouse and how they are used by the species in question .	-15.7430
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management , such as the preservation of meadows and forests for badges and other related species .	-4.2973
There has been a sharp decline in bat populations in Scotland and the UK in the last hundred years .	-3.9861
They are threatened by construction work affecting their sleeps and the loss of habitat .	-3.5695
Wind power plants and lighting can also represent a risk , as well as airplane strips and some chemical treatments of building materials , and household cats also play a role .	-5.7215
Fleather mouses are not blind .	-3.4977
Adapted to their night-time hunting activities , the ears are more useful when caught than the eyes .	-3.1550
They use sophisticated echo localization techniques to locate errors and obstacles in their flight .	-3.5631
The NTS , responsible for maintaining more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the baton very seriously .	-3.7289
There are ten trained experts who perform regular surveys , inspect sleeps and sometimes make rescues .	-3.7832
The organization has even established Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated Fledermaus Reserve in the Thread Property in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish bathing species are home .	-5.7637
According to David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-1.4705
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for badges . ”	-3.0813
" We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good habitat .	-2.0224
But there is still a lot of unknown about bad mouses and the work that we do here and elsewhere helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-4.3459
He emphasizes that before maintenance work in buildings , it is important to check whether bathing mouses are there , so it is possible that when a single sleep is destroyed by maternal animals , up to 400 females and boys may be extinguished from a local population .	-7.4338
Fledermouses are protected ; it is forbidden to kill them , disturb or destroy their sleeps .	-3.8784
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.8936
She said : “ We still have a lot to learn about our badges , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.7239

Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player would demand compensation for “ intangible damage amounting to the seriousness of injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years in the past . ”	-4.1487
The alleged incident is to be attributed in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.1776
According to documents submitted at the Clark County Court in Nevada US State , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player 's room in a night club , where he raped them anally .	-15.0258
Mayorga claimed that Ronaldo fell on the knee after the alleged incident , and said that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” abandoned by the “ one percent . ”	-4.2003
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had the pair sex , but it was agreed .	-2.7888
Mayorga also claims that she was going to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had " fear of retaliation " and worried about being " publicly humiliated " .	-4.1817
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid , as she remains traumatised by the alleged incident .	-4.0775

Brexit : Britain would regret it forever to lose car manufacturers .	-2.2881
“ The UK would regret temporary life if it were to lose its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Minister Greg Clark .	-3.5708
He added that it is worrying that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily cease production at its plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.2251
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-0.8166
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.2828
The plant in Burnaston , which manufactures the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-2.8559
“ When Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think it will come to a stop in our work , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO at Toyota in Burnaston .	-3.9444
Other British car manufacturers have expressed concerns about leaving the EU without agreement on the procedures for cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.7876
BMW , for example , has already announced its plant in Oxford after Brexit for a month .	-2.2194
The most important concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.0676
Toyota 's production facilities are based on demand-oriented manufacturing , that is , the parts are supplied every 37 minutes by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for special production .	-4.1823
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays on the border that , according to industry , may lead to shortages of supply and partial shortages .	-4.5230
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock in his work in Derbyshire , the company said , and that would stop production .	-2.7761
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU is ‘ calibrated precisely to avoid border controls ’ .	-3.1889
We need to have a deal ; we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed , we want to take that opportunity , ” he said to the Today programme of BBC Radio 4 .	-4.5781
“ Note not only of Toyota but also of other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-3.6540
Toyota did not determine how long the production stop could take , but warned that the cost rise could , in the long term , suffer the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-5.1471
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives and has been working in Burnaston for 24 years , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ I experience that , once they have been reduced , jobs are lost forever . ”	-4.6866

Trump ’ s meeting with Rosenstein may be moving again , says the White House says the Wh.	-13.6638
Donald Trump ’ s high-profile meeting with the Deputy People ’ s Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be " postponed another week " , as the battle over the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-4.4218
Rosenstein supervises the work of the Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in elections , links between Trump and Russia , and the possible disability of justice by the president .	-3.7140
Whether Trump will fire or not the Deputy Public Prosecutor , and to jeopardise the independence of Müller , Washington has given a lot of track for months .	-4.3390
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed carrying a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president over the 25th constitutional addition .	-3.2991
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.3970
Last Monday , however , he went to the White House , while there were reports that he was close to resigning .	-3.6522
Instead , a Thursday meeting with Trump , which was at the time in New York at the United Nations , was announced . that the , with , , . , , , with , , , with	-11.9005
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the consultation of the Senate Committee of Justice , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , accused him of sexual misconduct . .	-17.4940
On Friday , Trump ordered a weekly FBI investigation of claims against Kavanaugh , and further delayed a full senator .	-2.8926
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesperson , Sarah Sanders , was shown on Fox News on Sunday .	-18.5960
After the Rosenstein meeting asked , she said : ' A deadline for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I was going back another week , in view of all the other things that are going with the Supreme Court .	-12.0737
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-11.5214
Some reporters would contest this assertion : Sanders did not hold a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.5913
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.7348
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not an opposition to television reporters , who were responsible for being self-representing , but also said that ' I will not be in the gallery ' .	-7.1597
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.2355
" The President performs more questions and answers when every president beforehand , " she said and added , without mentioning evidence : " We have seen these figures . "	-4.8513
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but if the press had the chance to ask the President of the United States directly , that is infinitely better than talking to it .	-4.1041
We are trying to do a lot of things , and you have seen how we have done this in recent weeks , and a press talk will be replaced if you can speak to the President of the United States itself . ”	-4.4474
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.7910
Press conferences with a person are rare .	-1.5056
In New York , the president perhaps this week showed why by making a freelance and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-4.2081

Foreign buyers will charge a higher stamp tax rate when buying real estate in Britain - the additional money will be used for homeless , Theresa May today announces .	-17.4501

“ It ’ s not an easy task to do there , but I ’ m likely to be successful only if I can bring the club back there . ”	-4.3592

Pub and bar groups experienced a 2.7 % revenue in July , but revenues in restaurants slowed 4.8 % , as the figures are .	-5.2631
Peter Martin , CGA ’ s consultancy , which compiled the figures , said : “ Sustained sunshine and England ’ s longer than expected permanent participation in the World Cup led July to follow a similar pattern as in June last month , when the pub visits increased by 2.8 % , only the restaurants were even more affected .	-5.7020
The drop in the catering industry by 1.8 % in June has only worsened in July .	-2.9749

Milk pump advertising , where mothers are compared with cows , has led to controversial online discussions leading to controversial online discussions .	-2.9800
A milk pump enterprise has caused controversial online discussions due to an advertisement that compares quiet mothers with milk cows .	-4.3400
On the occasion of the introduction of the supposedly " noisy and portable milk pump " worldwide , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.6603
Four real mothers dance in a hypocrisy surrounded by cows to a number with the following song text : " Yes , I melt myself , but you don 't see a cock " and " If you don 't notice that there are no euts , it is my breasts . "	-13.7576
The slogan continues : " pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I melke my ladies " .	-2.6940
However , the display that was published on the Facebook page of the company has caused controversy online .	-16.6026
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from the spectators , many of whom say that it lights up the " horrors " of the dairy economy .	-3.7563
" It is a very bad decision to advertise with cows for this product " .	-1.7301
Like us , they must be pregnant and birth to produce milk except that their babies are taken away within just a few days after birth , " a person wrote .	-3.5832
The Elvie Milk Pump fits into a style BH ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-2.7128
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.6457
But , yes , why not promote with them a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.6561
Someone else added ' Such an outside acquisition ' . '	-14.4388
Others defended advertising , including a woman who confessed that she found the song “ urkomic ” .	-2.7688
I think that is a great idea .	-1.5194
I would have received one if I had ditched .	-2.3588
Through the pump I felt like a cow .	-3.7279
The display is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-1.8601
This is a genial product , " wrote a person .	-2.4661
Another commented : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who are pumping ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-12.4813
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy economy . '	-2.2056
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have danced all with the decent pumps in their BHs .	-15.7992
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows .	-2.0248
However , the Elvie Pump is clever , has no wires or hoses and fits constantly into a silent BH , giving women the freedom to keep their babies and even to go out for pumps .	-5.7598
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD commented on Mother : " The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that has earned a courageous and provocative market launch .	-3.3134
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on the breast pump and all its challenges , while demonstrating , in an entertaining and comparable manner , the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-12.9711

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly into a tent camp at the Texas border .	-2.8617
The number of imprisoned children with migration background increased , though monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the hard rhetoric and policies of the Trump administration made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-3.5263
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves and are afraid to be referred to the country when they work for a child .	-3.6047
The risk was increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-15.2367
Last week Matthew Albence , a high official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified before the Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-2.6791
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of the detainees did not have previous criminal records .	-2.4848
" Almost 80 % of the people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal austerity .	-3.3463
So we continue to follow these people , " said Albence .	-10.8827
In an effort to speed up the processing of children 's applications , officials introduced new rules that some of them are asking to appear before the courts within a month of arrest and not after 60 days of what was the previous standard , accommodation staff .	-21.7213
Many will appear not personally , but video telephone conference to advocate legal status for an immigration judge .	-4.4835
Those who do not question discharge are quickly put off .	-2.0689
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely they are to be anxiously or depressed , leading to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-3.6641
Advocates said that these concerns are reinforced in a larger institution like Tornillo , where signs that a child has to fight are more likely to be overlooked because of their size .	-11.5242
They added that moving children to the tent town without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to abandon friends could exacerbate a trauma that many are fighting with .	-4.3554
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.9164
Foreign Minister Walid al-Moualem called before the UN General Assembly to return to home , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-2.8540
Moualem , also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces were illegally on Syrian ground under the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ will be dealt with accordingly . ”	-3.6735
“ You must withdraw immediately , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.1825
Moualem claimed that “ war on terror ” was almost past in Syria , with over 360,000 people died in the country since 2011 , millions more being displaced from their homes .	-4.4056
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this sacred battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorists and “ any illegal foreign presence . ”	-2.9787
The US has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria ; mainly school and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-2.7184
France has used more than 1,000 ground soldiers in the devastated country .	-2.9444
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for return are fine , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears , ” which led refugees to keep away .	-4.0326
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organizations to facilitate the return , ” Moualem says .	-2.3627
“ You are really politicizing a purely humanitarian question . ”	-1.7705
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that only then can there be reconstruction aid for Syria once a political agreement between Assad and the opposition has come to an end to war .	-4.4248
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last important Rebellenhochburg Idlib enables political talks to move forward .	-3.5834
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented large-scale attacks from Syria ’ s support for the province , where three million people live .	-4.0141
Moualem emphasized , however , that the agreement prescribed “ clear deadlines , ” and hopes that the military use will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda , which will be “ extinguished . ”	-6.2122
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura soon hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-4.3686

For this new district in Pittsburg , the Democrat Conor Lamb – who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring .	-3.9983
Lamb opposes another incumbent , the Republican Keith Rothfus , who is currently representing the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which clearly overlaps with the new 17th .	-16.4685
The cards were remixed after the Pennsylvania Supreme Court decided in January that the old districts were manipulated in the sense of the Republicans .	-3.0878
The race in the new 17th has triggered a campaign financing exchange between the large party financing groups , the Democratic Campaign Congressional Committee ( DCCC ) and the National Republican Campaign Committee ( NRCC ) .	-3.3336

But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador , which received an estimated $ 140 million in American aid in 2017 , including stunt controls , development , and economic support .	-3.3333
The proposed sanctions , such as reducing financial aid and targeted visa restrictions , would have been painful for the country in Central America , with its high unemployment rate and high murder rates .	-2.6270
