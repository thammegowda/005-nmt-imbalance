Guide : More security for pedestrians	-2.2329
They are not 100 metres away : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian retreat at the village parking lot was brought into operation in Gutach - in view of the older town hall .	-6.6192
Two plants so close to each other : intention or magazine ?	-4.1147
Gutach 's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday .	-2.3457
" The Rathausample was installed at that time because it secures the school path , " explained corner yesterday .	-3.7447
The cluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .	-3.3477
The plant formally adopted yesterday is important for the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße crossing area .	-3.4514
We have the museum , two churches , park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-12.4159
" Another traffic light had to be created at the high road and pedestrian income , " so corner .	-5.0748
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the Offenburg State Council .	-2.7152
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass the municipality on the B 33 daily , about 10 % of these are heavy traffic , " Arnold stresses .	-4.9714
Therefore , building another light is more than necessary : " Security is simply happening here " , says Arnold .	-4.1136
Four traffic showers were carried out as a whole , and a roundabout was also considered , but again because of the narrow crossing of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-6.4764
It was tested previously by Arnold at the location of the traffic masts : " An extra loaded transport extra for us with particularly long wooden traffic jams , we have equipped whether these vehicles from the Sulzbachweg can leave the B 33 without turning the traffic masts " .	-9.3602
The approximately EUR 15 000 expensive traffic light plant itself is the most up-to-date in the market , explained Arnold .	-4.8924
The complex is equipped with colourful LEDs , which are so powerful that the lights are well recognized by drivers , for example , in the case of deep sun .	-6.6311
And sparing it is also : the older lighting systems use about 100 watts , the new just over eight watts .	-4.8754
There are three light systems per direction .	-2.3539
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : this is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.6157
When the pedestrian bridge presses the traffic button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-3.4551
If the road is free , come directly for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.8364
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be finished for the pedestrian .	-2.7099
" If a group or disabled people go over the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will surely cross the train " , explained Arnold .	-5.0694
Of course , the drivers need to take part in this as a partner and watch the railways .	-12.7165
This was not the case yesterday : little showed the traffic light for pedestrians green , an upper class vehicle broke through - at luminous red .	-4.5975
Josef Winkler has been writing about the need of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years .	-2.5541
The Carinthia poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childhood - linguistism , slope to rare violence and sexuality , narrow and joyless .	-6.2368
The Büchner prize winner is known above all as a prosator , theater texts are rare in his work .	-4.3393
Collage from Prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher composes a collage of prosatellite prosatellites for his performance " weather lights on the tongue " , which at in . , in , , , in , , in , in , in , in , , in , in , in , , in in , in , in ,	-28.8884
The theatre maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographic novel " Der Leibeige " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family surrounding " ( 2003 ) .	-11.3606
On the largely empty stage - important requirements : a crushed sofa that is continuously coupled and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is changing through the text material .	-5.5436
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-2.5587
The 70-minute performance outsources the template with a wealth of regional influences , known from the repertoire postdramatic forms .	-4.8685
Above all , the actors get out of the scene sometimes .	-13.6981
They are toughly toughened , poured under water , with their evening robes tackled to the wall .	-5.9256
Inflated in cellophane or mieder , they stack on dangerously high floors by the staging , either monologizing them loudly or are completely silent on the stage floor .	-5.2535
The text hardly conveys itself in this stringent way .	-3.4195
The best moments is the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folklore .	-3.8096
Only towards the end will the overturned performance come slightly into calm , and winkers after absurd humor have stopped .	-7.5770
A Blackbox in the car ?	-0.8090
US road planners are looking for a money source to repair the decaying highway system , and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the armature board of each car .	-5.0751
The devices recording every kilometre of driven and reporting information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads .	-4.6361
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly created an intense debate with colorful alliances .	-3.0377
Libertarians have joined environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres driven – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate fiscal modifications .	-4.5907
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.3337
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.7086
But while congressional action cannot be agreed , several states no longer wait .	-2.7989
They are currently examining how , over the next decade , they can switch to a system where drivers pay for miles .	-4.2895
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.4261
That really is a must for our country .	-1.7207
“ It is nothing that we may only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Southern California Assn. of Governments ’ managing director , who plans to record the miles driven in all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .	-5.1845
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.3237
There is the technology for this .	-1.9689
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , funded from the taxes that US Americans are paying on the pulp , is defaulted .	-4.3400
But America is no longer doing as much as it used to .	-3.2146
Cars use less petrol .	-1.2872
The State mineral oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone ( less than 4 Eurocent per litre ) has not gone up for 20 years .	-16.2672
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent , at high spread prices .	-3.5286
“ The tax on petrol is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.1977
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with a tachograph to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.9032
“ This is the most useful alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-9.9179
Bureaucrats call it a millent-based user fee .	-2.2573
It is not surprising that the idea is being found at urban liberals , for example , the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced .	-4.2381
The California planners rely on the system for drawing up strategies to achieve the ambitious , legally anchored objectives of the Federal State for climate change .	-4.3071
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also explained that he sees the most appropriate long-term alternative .	-3.7303
The free market of the Reason Foundation is also the idea of paying drivers after a returned route .	-5.4206
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” explains Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Reason Directives .	-2.7231
People pay directly for what they get .	-0.9016
The movement is also supported by two former US Transport Ministers who , in a report in 2011 , called on the Congress to move toward millent-based settlement . in the .	-18.1173
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million expensive pilot project last year , comprising 10,000 cars .	-2.1957
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , reacting to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who often have to move to work or to the city in everyday life .	-5.9111
Several states and major cities , however , are moving in this direction .	-2.9771
The most committed is Oregon , currently running 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-3.7224
These drivers will soon pay miles to the federal state instead of the mineral oil tax .	-3.0097
Nevada has completed a pilot project .	-1.0260
New York City is also considering this .	-2.1250
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with lorries .	-2.0521
And the I-95 coalition , which includes traffic ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-11.4895
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.7201
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with devices , drivers were sceptical of the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-2.7788
“ Observations about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” says Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada .	-3.6373
People did not want to .	-1.1279
When the test started , the Nevada ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to transform the tachograph into adult monitoring devices . ”	-3.8316
There is no need to build a huge technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-2.8755
Nevada belongs to a number of states now looking for affordable technology to capture the kilometres driven by the state , but not exactly when and where .	-4.0710
For Khan , the public would also be more reassuring .	-10.3817
Hunting after this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.4797
The company has not initially started to assist states with taxation of drivers .	-15.1500
Instead , it was their aim to take foot in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers were to pay on the basis of the miles driven .	-5.0418
But the devices it tested are also interesting for the road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is uploaded regularly by modem .	-4.6146
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and sites are not recorded , ” Ryan Morrison explained , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-3.5679
Great mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programs .	-1.9168
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .	-2.2549
In Oregon , the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a variety of choices . skills in skills , and in , , , , in . , , , , , , , ,	-15.4126
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.3146
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles passed by all the residents of the state .	-4.3994
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of suspicious public by equipping devices with more functions than with less .	-3.5377
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that also pays parking charges , pay for insurance only for driven kilometres , and compare speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic .	-23.2995
“ Drivers would be motivated by the added value of the benefits offered by the system to participate , ” it is said in a city planning document .	-3.3500
Some transport planners are wondering , however , whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre .	-3.8789
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for San Francisco Bay , officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax .	-3.1510
An additional one-off fee or annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little gasoline , so that they also pay a fair share .	-3.7268
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of Commission legislation and public affairs .	-3.2217
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers care about their privacy and many other things .	-2.5026
Royal Field : Small team beats wacker .	-3.1115
The voluntary fire brigade managed its autumn sample despite a lack of personnel with Bravour .	-3.8671
Only eleven man participated in the exercise .	-1.4835
Department commander Hans Kammerer had selected Feder at Burgberger Straße in his tuition .	-4.4510
There a short conclusion should be created during the saw .	-3.9187
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoking development , but one of them could still send an emergency call .	-3.5094
After the first review of the facts by Hans Kammerer , two defenders of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building .	-4.6972
After a short period of time , it managed to find the first person to be guided outside .	-4.3517
The second person had to be worn .	-0.7492
It was not so easy as there was a narrow staircase to get over .	-3.9162
The building , an integrated workshop for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.2834
It stored a lot of wood and also power balls in it .	-2.2226
Furthermore , there were still electrical wood processing machines .	-2.7673
The first deletion attack took place on the tank in the vehicle .	-2.1312
Another lead took place through an overflower hydrate in about 100 metres distance .	-4.5416
Now three extinguishing attacks have been added .	-2.6867
A pipeline was also used in the building .	-3.5550
Hans Kammerer was also concerned with the exercise to show what is to be done with low-cost staff .	-6.1069
In the seriousness there is support for the Königsfeld daily group .	-3.5080
The commander was satisfied with the course of the exercise .	-11.3177
Networking of universities and companies important .	-2.8800
During his visit to the county of Breisgau-Hochschulford , LandtagsPresident Guido Wolf was also informed of where tomorrow ’ s workers come from .	-5.0030
He raised this important issue at the Hochschwarzwild Fund Centre , together with the Managing Directors of School Heads of Vocational Education , as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the Chairman of the Parents ' Committee .	-7.6904
" Education is an important location factor " , underlined Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project to the Hochschwarzford Forest .	-4.9028
Wolf was impressed by the model projects to train Wolf .	-3.2107
Since 2011 , the Forest City has had successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum , the Kreisgymnasium and the Vocational Center .	-4.3527
He also praised family friendliness in the county .	-2.9284
" It is important not only to have a family phase in mind , but also to take the phase of caring for family care , " explained Wolf .	-4.9023
He also said that more and more employees were looking after the care and care of their families .	-4.3917
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the working relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.9825
But no one could afford to lose qualified workers , he continued to say .	-1.5976
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.4592
" Because whoever knows the region ’ s merits during his studies , his acquired knowledge and skills often remain the regional economy , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , " the country president was convinced .	-6.1340
Only if adequate training places were offered can the skilled workforce be met .	-3.4707
In his opinion , the district advantage is its favourable location in the southwest of Germany , in the immediate vicinity of France and Switzerland .	-3.7910
He also witnessed the efforts he has already made to expand public passenger transport on his railway journey from Titisee Neustadt to Freiburg .	-5.4835
" Stay stubbornly and ensure that public transport becomes better , " he explained to the address of the local politicians present .	-3.5755
Experience music with an entertaining afternoon .	-2.3326
For 15 years the Kaul family has invited the Dietingen seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vessel .	-3.2394
In the past , older citizens were served in the restaurant .	-3.6089
This afternoon , in St. Josef 's care secret , is now taking place .	-4.3912
The residents enjoy the delicious cakes and cakes .	-3.0115
Later there was a salad .	-2.1995
With common melodies , Silvia Kimich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich maintained .	-12.0900
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front distinction of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstraße ( Kirchstraße ) is to be replaced with the city of Bräunlingen 's recovery costs .	-6.6064
In the days before the kilbig , a small angle wall , stabilization and static discharge of the over a hundred years old stone wall with Balustrade was built in the first works of rehabilitation of the front school cour.	-6.4457
Further action envisages Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger City Office to incorporate the National Monument into the planning and create a recovery concept for the old wall .	-5.2451
A cost calculation by professionals is subsequently to be put on the table to the local council to decide and determine the follow-up .	-16.1420
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-2.4367
After the renovation , plastering and tree planting of the old school inner courtyard within the two side wings of the 1912 school built , the school must be refurbished in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure , the restructuring wall in need of ground to be renovated and put on new substructure .	-7.4224
The historic , one hundred years old boundary wall of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstraße , is above all through water and frost damage , since there is no drainage , needy to renew and have a sign forward .	-6.9256
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to weather damage , but the wall is not currently under crash .	-3.4982
A standard wall is a prerequisite for a school court used by students , which has been done through the current fixing work .	-4.5215
Originally , school refurbishment was even planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditures postponed .	-4.6814
An important word in the historical school wall refurbishment , which has already been used for film photographs , will take part in the National Monument .	-5.9822
Should specifications come from this site , the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monumental protectors .	-5.2692
The Bräunlinger Primary School pupils , now being taught in a well-refurbished old school building with a new Aula , can soon use the old school courtyard .	-5.0966
Özdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart .	-1.5460
In the ongoing discussions on the future of the music universities in Baden-Württemberg , Cem Özdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now also taken part .	-4.9213
" I think it is wrong to abandon holistic training in the Stuttgart Music University , " said Özdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.4564
Jazz and classics are just part of the Stuttgart jazz site .	-2.8399
The Green Red Government is thus contrary to Özdemir , who is a favourite for a direct mandate in the German election on September 22 .	-5.2183
On the basis of an expert study , this puts forward a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.7399
The Mannheim Music University ( Musikhochschule Mannheim ) will then be relocated to the Musikhochschule Mannheim ( Musikhochschule Musikhochschule ) .	-6.1392
US border : " Super-Tunnel " discovered for drug smuggling	-2.3055
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and decommissioned a super tunnel for drug smuggling .	-3.1623
As the US customs authorities have said , Tijuana and San Diego ’ s more than 500 metres long tubes were equipped with electricity , rail tracks , and ventilation facilities .	-4.4104
Three suspects were thus arrested , eight tonnes of Marihuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-12.0927
The tunnel was not used yet , according to the data .	-3.3417
" These cartels are stupid when they think they could run through under the radar , " said the prosecutor of the US district Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a San Diego camp where that had been discovered an end to the tunnel .	-4.9467
Duffy assured us that if you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make a huge waste of your dirty money .	-3.8963
Both the US authorities and Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drugs cartels .	-2.4928
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.3796
Experts Construct from Experts	-2.8234
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers , and that the construction took place about a year .	-4.5786
The train station was equipped to use electrically operated cars there .	-4.5775
On the Mexican side there is access in a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-3.3622
According to the authorities , a ladder takes a depth of 20 meters to the actual tunnel entrance .	-11.6425
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres and 90 centimeters wi. in , in , , in , , in . , , in ,	-11.9161
It would have been a good idea to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-3.2582
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.6334
The third , a Mexican , was caught because of the seized marihuana .	-2.8618
All three threatens to be the highest penalty for lifelong imprisonment , as officials have said .	-3.8246
Eight such tunnels have been discovered since 2006 , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-3.2448
However , this is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel building .	-2.8590
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .	-2.7558
This shows the ' despair ' of drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA in San Diego .	-3.7919
They would do everything possible to reach the US .	-2.4059
No details were given to the detainees , at least one of them was Mexican .	-2.6173
They must expect sentences of up to ten years .	-2.4267
2014 Geising Festival	-2.9690
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-2.4954
Return the first curriculum mention is getting closer and closer .	-3.5892
When the year ends in eight weeks , the anniversary is over .	-3.9638
Hosting and church houses were first mentioned in a radical manner 794 .	-3.8372
A certificate was made in churches , both of which are mentioned .	-2.4148
On 15 March there is to be an official start to the anniversary year , and as hostages currently have no hall , this event takes place in the place where both of them were mentioned first in church houses 1250 years ago .	-6.1285
During the anniversary , various events are planned both in hostages and in church houses .	-3.9603
Church houses will be held in July 1250 on a weekend from July 18 to 20 .	-3.2390
Return .	-1.1378
On Friday with a festival on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall .	-13.0938
On this weekend there is also the church house church fest .	-12.3918
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary showing three appointments .	-3.4974
On 21 June together with the sunny festival of the Black Forest Association , on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-4.4160
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official deadline is on September last weekend , 27 and 28 September .	-3.8358
On the occasion of the Hisinger City , a new chronicle is also brought out .	-14.6006
" But it should be a chronic not only of hostages themselves , but also a printed work on the hostages of today , which consists of hostages , church homes , glasses , aults and gutmadings , " said Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-6.5082
And today ’ s hostage is also celebrating 2014 birthday , in 1974 today ’ s space was carried out with communities .	-4.0379
The new chronic will be presented in Hostage on November 21 or 22 , in the new Halle .	-5.3016
But 2014 is also a year with many anniversaries .	-3.1992
The narrration starts on 8 February with a custom sand on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and will celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-5.9362
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Heiringer School has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10 , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen is 150 years old and celebrates it in the context of the Festival of July 4 to 7 .	-4.8724
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a certificate of donation owned by the St. Gallen monastery .	-3.8560
The document was made in churches ( homes ) , which was then court .	-4.1174
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.2049
Reason to celebrate this 1250-year-old in 2014 is also 40 years later .	-4.4205
Council takes sliding plants to the target audience	-4.4809
Should the transition to " Am Hirschen " be expensively rebuilt to increase road safety ?	-3.4739
Yes , the councils have decided .	-1.3841
Shield must have EUR 220 000 in hand for this .	-3.6695
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway track next year .	-2.6806
The safety of rail transitions is particularly intended to be increased - there are regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles throuin .	-6.8106
If the communities agree to reconstruction measures , they must participate in the cost , the rest share railways and federations .	-4.9917
Siltach ’ s Master Roland Greißhaber explained the special characteristics of the railway transition " Am Hirschen " to the .	-5.5061
There , the city plans to build a reservation in height of the tunnel mountain there , west of the railway track .	-4.8103
There , bigger vehicles , such as those carrying long-wood , could be on counter-traffic without having to block the rails .	-6.0991
Greek , therefore , proposed to construct a necessary base wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road at the appropriate time to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-4.5161
This was controversial in the councillor , because some Councils doubted the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , with his statement , brought the critics ' s mood to the point : ' Do we need to take so much money for so few vehicles ? '	-5.8740
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : the transition from the railway " Hirschen " is regularly used for long-term trans.	-4.7361
Even wood from the area " Kuhbach " is partly transported across this route , because up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke , because they could not turn to the main road there .	-25.8201
In addition , the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.3250
Because it is foreseeable that Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels should be rebuilt and refurbished , as is currently the case in Wolfch , the transition to " Hirschen " could also be an important transport meaning for a longer period of time .	-6.5226
Councils agreed to carry out an investigation into the costs of the road ’ s intended proliferation .	-4.5949
Nevertheless , the majority of the conversion of the railway transition was agreed with the provision that the necessary wall is built in such a way that the city could develop the subsequent road towards " Railway Station " , where appropriate , for encounter traffic to around 5.5 meters .	-6.6101
The transition of the railway at the Trautwine district could , on the other hand , cause a very different problem , affecting access to the ' ruler houses ' path .	-7.0399
The administration had examined the reconstruction plans by the Breinlinger Engineering Office , since it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would be even easier .	-5.9853
The study concluded that the road ’ s tendency could not be excluded from the fact that longer vehicles are in place .	-5.3230
In turn , the responsibility for this was shared by the city as a street building bureau . by . the , , by , , . , , , ,	-13.2154
The transformation could therefore lead to disputes of liability .	-3.1742
Because both wood exports and removal worked in the current state of expansion , the transition should not be approved , Haas argued .	-5.8149
Here , too , the risk of a collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition should be much lower than the other train transitions , because the next stop is the middle point where there is a good connection of view .	-7.4472
Even trains from the main train station would have to be slowed down to the point that no collision threatens .	-5.1566
Most of the time , consent was denied to the transition of the railway , because the city of Schiltach would have to ' bail out ' the problem of seated vehicles , as the councils could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction works were completed .	-7.5889
As unproblematic , the body looks at the rebuildings at the railway transitions " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which cross-border agreements have already been made with the railways . , in , , in . , , in , , in , ,	-13.6675
Esa decides on large space missions : billions missions	-2.1399
Far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to launch in the next few years .	-3.0212
30 proposals were available and five are still in the race .	-2.6055
Far worlds .	-0.4265
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.0378
Whether there are at least some of them , nobody knows .	-2.5890
The selection is hard to choose : Should you be looking for gravitational waves ?	-10.9253
Or would you prefer to explore the origin of the cosmos ?	-2.6464
Or after a similar planet , and thus perhaps discover extraordinary life ?	-5.3589
These are the questions being asked by those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa .	-2.9242
For their " Cosmic Vision " program , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are designed to make a decisive contribution to research .	-4.4983
The budget for such ' L-missions ' is approximately EUR 1 billion .	-1.7079
The launch will be expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-11.9318
In early September , European Space Research Elite met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-1.9374
30 ideas have been discussed , five of them have now entered the closer election .	-3.3897
Numerous bodies reviewed the proposals , tied up with researchers .	-3.9008
In the next few days , a final decision will be taken by the scientific committee of programme. by in the , in , , in . , , , , , in ,	-14.4561
In total , four major questions have been selected by the Esa to answer the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007 .	-3.4813
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life ?	-1.4962
The exact operations of the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the creation of planets that circle these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-4.5509
A big infrared escope in all this darkness could penetrate through .	-14.5868
And if a star has planets under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-2.9295
To address this issue , 2017 is to launch the space telescope " Cheops " , which will scan 500 known planet systems in our nearby area .	-5.5193
But the possibilities are limited , cheops are a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.4477
With larger instruments , astronomers could display similar planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , thus seeking " biomarkers " : gases that are considered to be an indicator of biological activity .	-4.7753
How does the solar system work ?	-1.5385
Ultimately , this question should also provide an insight into what conditions exist for the creation of life .	-5.1685
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field and its particle radiation with the planet system .	-3.8208
In our solar system , these processes can be examined in a copy of this kind .	-4.7154
With the Solar Orbiter the Esa has already approved a mission of the M class ( where the budget is approximately half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.0092
The song is due to launch in 2017 and the sun 's surface and activity is to be closely monitored .	-3.9786
Jupiter and his moon are of great interest to researchers .	-2.2821
You want to find out what role the giant planet has played in developing the solar system .	-3.3054
In order to achieve this , Esa presents the first of the total three L-missions of the " Cosmic Vision " . the of , , and , , , the of .	-13.5355
The Sonde " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its trip in 2022 .	-11.6862
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and is supposed to study the planet 's atmosphere and the icy moon Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-11.4100
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.7364
The Well offers many opportunities to study material under extreme conditions and to examine in such a way that the laws of nature we know are still valid there .	-5.2670
Perhaps there are also deviations that could show the physicists the way to a new theory , under which all the well-known laws of nature are united .	-12.5169
What was the universe created and what is it ?	-2.7689
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos were created by the bankruptcy .	-3.8504
Besides the frequent material from stars , planets and living creatures like us exist , there are dark matter whose gravity galaxies and galaxy clusters combine , and dark energy through which the expansion of space is accelerating .	-6.4284
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the Urknall , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .	-4.1903
With " Euclid " , Esa has already approved an M mission to be launched for 2020 .	-3.7969
A special telescope is designed to examine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time on the whole sky , thus allowing for returns to the source of dark matter and dark energy .	-15.4009
Anyone who could make the race track ? !	-13.9553
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection process .	-1.5446
The best chances of gravity as a L-mission , according to many experts , E-Lisa is a demanding concept of gravity waves .	-4.7327
This understands physicists ’ changes in space structure , which Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-2.9983
They have not been proven to date .	-2.4252
Elisa could do that , hoping scientists behind the project .	-2.2556
The mission provides a detector with two or three songs , which is stationed in all .	-2.7373
He could also demonstrate gravitational waves of plants created on the earth , giving new insights into the origin of the cosmos .	-6.4208
Four other proposals compete with the second L-mission : a large X-nitrogen escope called Athena , which is to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the external planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is to track and investigate similar planets .	-5.5233
Amongst other things , suggestions for sample return transportation from Mars , the exploration of Mond , Venus and Asteroids , and sunshine physics are already .	-5.9684
Snowden is willing to “ cooperate ” with Germany in terms of US surveillance .	-2.1282
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and to tell before the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities .	-4.1914
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-3.1995
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , he writes : “ Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a different view as a failure and seeks to criminalise political expression with a threat of punishment that is not possible to defend . ”	-6.0758
But to say the truth is not a crime .	-1.2963
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that support from the international community can convince the American Government to fall charges against him .	-3.8090
The charge collected by the US Ministry of Justice includes spionage and theft of state property .	-3.2569
The German Minister for the Interior , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said to us online : “ When Mr Snowden is prepared to speak with German representatives , we find ways to make that possible . ”	-4.5711
Relations between the USA and Germany are burdened by the allegations that the NSA has heard Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.6180
Thomas Oppermann , the honourable Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , to “ jeopardize without him and to completely ruin relations with the US . ”	-5.1650
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter Feed . the was in . , , in the , , in the , , , in , ,	-15.2173
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.1380
Ströbele explained that , according to the former NSA staff , Snowden could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-3.1963
If Snowden says in Germany , he will need an assurance that he is ‘ safe ’ , the honourable Member said .	-4.5251
Snowden explains in his letter that he was facing a “ serious and ongoing ” tracking campaign that distributed him from his home .	-4.0608
But he is touched by the global response to “ my act of political opinion . ”	-2.1828
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a merit of the general public .	-3.6883
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.0485
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage charges	-0.7421
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to $ 100 of passengers wanting to stop baggage on their flight .	-2.9654
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade , even if the Wednesday announcement was to read that passengers are likely to keep the entire dose .	-4.1266
The new charge applies for hand baggage in the luggage compartment , small bags under the seat are still free .	-3.3470
Frontier explained that it is charged USD 25 if the charge is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who are only paid on the flight .	-5.4511
Frontier speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is intended to move travellers to pay in advance .	-14.5841
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.1181
Airlines started charging for the first and second pieces of baggage .	-2.7066
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have thus stopped into hand baggage as much as possible , resulting in the fact that the baggage substances are often overflown above the location .	-15.2832
Fees are one way to encourage passengers to take less on board .	-2.4419
O 'Malley said that at the new cost it is not really about making money .	-2.9624
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who would have clearly expressed that it would become increasingly difficult to find space above the seat .	-15.2113
Passengers who buy tickets on the airline website do not have to pay for them .	-3.0352
This means that a passenger may take a baggage free of charge at the Frontier flight , but the next person will have to pay $ 100 for a comparable baggage .	-4.3099
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they joined the flight .	-3.7439
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only enter into force in the summer , and there is no such date .	-11.5358
Passengers often discourage baggage supplements and other charges , but airlines are happy to resort to them .	-3.7351
They argue that the transport of baggage should cost money , and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-4.6275
Many on Wall Street consider the new baggage charges to be a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss .	-3.7498
Most of them have so far left the fingers for hand baggage charges .	-3.3220
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded the first payment for hand baggage three years ago , and later , Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-5.3695
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who carefully pursues the additional charges .	-4.2160
In a report of December 2011 , he estimated that the Spirit handbaggage charge would bring US $ 50 million per year .	-13.0242
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , recently flown with spirit and was curious , what would expect him to take off the flight if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-5.1816
“ The boarding process was one of the smooth ones I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-2.4023
I expected to see teeth cherries and hands-on discussions at the flight .	-3.4714
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding went as lubricated . ”	-3.0304
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.4298
The company explained that passengers who buy limonade or juice are likely to retain all doses and coffee will be filled free .	-4.4863
Water is still free of charge .	-0.9375
US Airways had recently tried to demand money for refreshing drinks in 2008 , but it reversed seven months later after passengers complained and had not complained of any other large society .	-5.2010
Frontiers step in charging handbaggage charges if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the recent initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-3.1778
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-3.2793
This gives all societies an incentive to get passengers to buy them directly , rather than through an online travel agency .	-4.2582
Frontier has , however , gone the most widely in this area .	-2.4218
In September , the company began to award only half the flight miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-4.3264
On Wednesday , the miles were cut once again to 25 % of the route .	-11.8740
A journey booked with Frontier over 1000 miles for a third party is therefore only 250 miles .	-4.2197
Passengers may also reserve passengers at the Frontier Square website for direct purchase .	-13.9033
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .	-2.5346
The revenue decreased by 9 % , and aircraft capacity shrinked just under 13 percent in the first quarter , as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the mother company Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-13.9823
Republic has tried to get Frontier ’ s finances under the sale of society .	-3.4128
Speakers from the Bible	-2.4971
Gut 40 women visited the last women breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .	-2.4837
The theme of the day in the municipal House were " sayings from the Bible " and " Middle Ages ' .	-3.8550
After breakfast , Zita Köhler , the chairman of the parish council , went to the biblical proverb in a lecture .	-3.9782
'Saying words contain wisdom , rules or warnings ' , she explained .	-2.5522
She compared several sayings with the appropriate bibliographs and declared the meaning .	-10.2813
She called sayings like : wooden eyes are vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throwing an eye on someone who gives His words the Lord in sleep , washing his hands innocent .	-4.9150
On several occasions , the referentine also advised her listeners what proverb they were .	-4.9472
The turn from the Middle Ages took on board the Church Commonwealth of Christel Dehner : All good things are three , blue , have something to haunt .	-6.0227
She declared the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges into the past ' .	-2.7557
To conclude , a tombola was lost .	-2.2773
The prices were covered on a table and were rewritten humorously before passing them to the winners .	-14.6985
Among the visitors to the Breakfast Round , mayor Roman Waizenegger was also mixed .	-3.4760
Learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for unskilled tourism	-2.6805
Today , at the Mecklenburg Lakes Plate , a pilot project for the tourism industry started .	-3.3813
Under the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as an unskilled in the industry are supposed to be qualified over three winters to experts for hotels and restaurants .	-5.1465
" New to this is that the six-month courses end with qualifications , " said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Agency .	-3.2952
The benefits are diverse : participants would not be unemployed , the companies were trained professionals who lacked increasingly hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-5.9263
The Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also participating in the project .	-3.9202
NSA explains that a “ internal error ” and not hacker is to blame on the crash of the site ’ s site ’ s crash .	-3.6417
The shadowy National Security Agency explained on late Friday , an error came to its public website a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-4.6982
“ NSA.gov was not reachable for a few hours this night as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” explained the spy agency in an e-mail message sent to you .	-4.6772
The problem will be resolved this evening .	-1.4082
The claim that the failure was caused by a Denial of Service Attack ( DDoS ) was not true .	-2.7071
During the early evening , online server trackers found that at least six hours the NSA website was unaccessible and that is still not available for some users .	-4.5795
Previously , a NSA spokesperson to ABC News explained that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network is “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.1847
Secret information is not in danger , so the speaker says .	-1.8593
At least one group of hactivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.7779
In such attacks , the target site is flooded with page calls until the server is overloaded and the site collapses .	-3.1253
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to influence the internal network of the target system .	-3.2177
The former supersecret NSA , whose top name once No Such Agency ( no such authority ) is now in the bright light of the public , and after the revelations about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad , the result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disillusioned former NSA staff , Edward Snowden .	-6.7412
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of targeted cyper-operation .	-4.3045
Easily declining the number of people without jobs in October 22 to 1,307 .	-3.2013
While the quota was 3.1 % better than last year and even better than in September , " we had hoped for more " , says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Managing Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen .	-4.9281
Because many companies have so far reacted in settings .	-3.7715
One reason is according to Felder-Bauer : " We have hardly any professionals in the craft , in health care and in the care of the elderly . "	-15.0687
Since September we have also carried out job opportunities for personnel in the hotel and restaurant industry .	-4.3062

Bombardier winnings in Bombardier after fall in deliand . in . the in , . in , , in .	-13.5833
Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturers Bombardier Inc announced a 15-percent decline in net profits on Thursday after it was under pressure from lower orders and deliveries to aircraft in the third quarter , as well as treaty problems in the railway savings .	-5.3581
Bombardier , headquartered in Montreal , did not publish flight test data for its brand new CSeries aircraft and did not give any new information on whether the aircraft could go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-5.2639
At the boys of the test aircraft one and a half months ago , only three more launches have been followed , which makes it clear whether the test phase is as planned .	-5.9025
The results were lagged behind the forecasts and led to a fall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-4.2659
Cameron Doersen , National Bank Financial analyst , lowered his evaluation of “ outperforming ” on Thursday to “ sector perform ” with a view to keeping the share in the next one to two quarters in a limited spot-potential .	-5.6427
“ While weaker delivery numbers for aircraft were largely expected , margin development in the transport sector is clearly disappointed , ” doerrates said in a customer letter .	-5.1997
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program processes for the aircraft .	-3.6282
If , however , no new orders are issued in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical of the programme .	-3.3938
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft craft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.9271
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flowed for the first time in September after months of delays .	-2.4917
But binding orders for CSeries with 177 are moderate , as potential buyers are waiting for the results of flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential for the new nozzle aircraft are true .	-4.9852
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.3283
CEO Pierre Beaudoin has confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .	-3.3157
On Thursday , company management also assured analysts and media , the program was on the schedule .	-5.4601
“ The test aircraft has stayed on the ground no longer than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the aircraft ’ s booth had been used as ground tests and software updates .	-4.3441
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.5981
We decided to take a first flight and then add a revision period , which we did .	-2.9288
This is happening throughout the entire flight programme .	-2.1900
The second of five test aircraft is likely to start in the next few weeks , the other shortly thereafter , it was from the company 's side .	-4.9737
However , analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the boy flight the first customer can take on an aircraft of the CSeries .	-4.0943
Bombardier explained that it checks the start-up planning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-2.2878
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if they obviously correspond to Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that start-up shifts to the first quarter of 2015 , ” Doersen said .	-4.8311
In the third quarter , at the end of September 30 , net profits fell to $ 147 million and 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 cent per share earlier .	-3.7638
The matched profit per share is 9 cent unchanged .	-2.6569
Sales declined slightly from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.0666
Analysts expected a 10 cents profit per share and $ 4.56 billion sales , as Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-3.4540
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-2.6419
The net statements fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.1240
The order book in the aerospace park was $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , unchanged to 31 December .	-3.2083
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were in our specifications , but the low order intake and market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.4394
Sales in the aerospace park fell 13 % to two billion dollars .	-2.6201
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales rose by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-2.7842
The order book in the transport party was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September and was thus slightly higher than 31 December .	-3.2415
The transport profit margin was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-2.4597
According to the management of the company , new guidelines will apply to the fourth quarter .	-2.7685
In the afternoon trading on Thursday , the bombardier stock decreased by 8.5 % , and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after it was also announced that the Google Finance Board , Patrick Pichette , will change to the Board .	-5.5336

Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss against police investigation must be in prison .	-2.6547
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to Neil Scarborough Underworld Size .	-3.0992
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light .	-1.8388
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-2.0318
A well-known prosecutor who warned a drug baron of a large police investigation because he feared his secret drug addiction was discovered was sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.3762
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provides Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after compromising his own cocain-seeking .	-4.2303
Criminalists ’ lawyer , “ first-class ” with the top name “ Bash , ” was arrested in 2011 , after the police had monitored Scarborough , which he had represented in a former drug procedure .	-5.2425
Officials watched how Scarborough ( 32 ) three Beutles cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a meal of the attorney .	-4.6612
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed drugs from class A , after his hair traces of cocaine were found in tests , on his wallet and on credit cards .	-5.4968
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to get unauthorized information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.7289
All four suspects were supervised by the police during a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-2.8677
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash in a series of house searches .	-18.8041
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that drug addiction could become public .	-2.2979
Today Ditta , working for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted of the Liverpooler Crown Court for a triweek trial in two charges for obstructing the judiciary .	-5.0300
He gave cocaine possession during a previous survey .	-3.3271
The lawyer was transferred after the police found in their investigations against Scarborough that it had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.6631
Two inquiries followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta 's house , where the drugs were put under the lawyer 's rubbish with a purity of 60 % in a black golf shoe .	-5.1877
Shortly after he delivered the drugs , telephoned Scarborough regularly with Ditta , who was at the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .	-3.4950
The lawyer returned home , drugs collected and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-2.6331
Prior to the court , it was known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after his hair , wallet , and credit card tests had been discovered in his hair .	-5.3115
Ditta was arrested later , but disputed to take cocaine and said that he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and said that her discussion was subject to the “ lawyer secret . ”	-4.2900
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a series of credit cards , but they were assured and a sample was taken from him .	-3.5609
He said at the police interrogation that he operated an office and clients at home for legal affairs , both under his private address and at work .	-4.4490
Prior to the Court , it was known that he had called for important drug trafficking actors , some of whom had previously represented , and informed what the investigators knew about them .	-5.3099
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.4107
Ditta is charged with abusing his position as a criminal defender , because he has too much involvement with certain clients .	-4.3306
The relationship in question is not simply a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-2.4889
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-3.2053
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.4483
He opposed police investigations as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-3.6448
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute .	-2.2586
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.1699
Ditta had any failure and claimed , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I did not want to pass on to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-4.9945
But after the hearing , Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta did the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to purchase drugs from organised criminals . ”	-4.1087
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-3.9107
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public .	-1.6777
Ditta has lost this confidence and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-3.1384
The Serious and Organized Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to condemnation in three cases due to the possession of cocaine and judicial impediment , underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.3170
This case should be a warning to criminals and show that none can escape the arm of the law .	-2.4048
We will find you and bring you to dish .	-9.3269
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after having declared guilty of conspiracy as heroin , cocaine , and cannabis trading .	-3.3323
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were condemned to a total of 153 years of punishment for drug offences .	-3.7942
Ditta published on his website an area of questions and answers about himself , saying that his dream job is to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and inequality is the motivation for his work .	-4.6880
Revolutionary work of Church Music	-10.3312
At the end of the celebrations of 160 years of existence , the Liederkranz Dunningen will surround two Services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.3848
After the great success of the musicals " Rock my Life " , which excited the spectators in the spring of this year , the song sick will enrich two god services with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert .	-4.9314
On Saturday , October 26 , this extraordinary exhibition will be heard from 19 during the dinner fair at the St. Martinus Church Dunningen and Sunday , October 27 , at the God Service in the St. John Baptist Church in Lackendorf .	-5.2577
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Songs to the celebration of the Sacred Victim of the Fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual music of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was nearly revolutionary at the time of the origin .	-5.2411
The fair will be listed in the context of the services of God , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-16.1180
Under the guidance of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ by the Blazer group .	-4.1972
Haslach : Skepsis is growing confidence .	-11.4742
Elections to the parish community 2015 , for example , will change fundamental things in the Haslach Unit ( SE ) .	-4.0939
There is then only one common parish gallery for all six parish trips .	-3.7421
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welshenstein prepared for the changes .	-3.0741
Because the fundamental decisions of the diocese have nothing to change and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.4097
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism of the new is hesitant but hesitant to grow confidence .	-5.0731
From the ideas and expectations of innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish community , the very constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the maritime team were enough .	-5.5660
Regional decan Georg Schmitt explained the new directives for maritime units at the Archdiocese of Freiburg on a presentation .	-4.4289
Thereafter , the SE Haslach , as a parish of church , will be a body of public law that will enter the rights and duties of the six parish church communin the past .	-6.3016
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation council in which the parish power is represented .	-4.0463
Each parish should be represented by at least two elected members , and the six parish teams are formed on the ground .	-4.0229
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in future .	-3.0903
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed a great deal of talk .	-12.8835
Innovations stipulate that accumulated credit is maintained for purposes purpose-bound in the parcost .	-5.9801
Liabilities , on the other hand , go to the community as a whole .	-3.2438
Especially with regard to the major planned investments , the obligation to which all paragraphs will meet , there were great concerns .	-6.9752
" Even in the past , only invested in projects that could be handled by the individual parish alone , " relativized Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-4.6142
Practical experience with a joint body for five parishes described Barbar Kritter , the chairman of the body in the Seelsor Unit Schutterwald Neuried .	-4.8600
They had set themselves the task in 2006 , ' becoming one , five will stay ' , and they had to say that it is not that easy .	-5.9709
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorgebietet then made an effort to answer questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-4.6301
The preparations will be specified in further meetings and decided in a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-3.9174
In the end , Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new maritime unit logo , which was approved by a clear majority .	-3.5487
In Pfullendorf , electricity is becoming more expensive .	-2.6149
Püllendorf ’ s citizens must adapt to higher cost of electricity . , , , , , and , . the , and the , the . the , the	-14.7965
As the Managing Director of the Municipal Works , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pfullendorf family will receive 70 to 90 euros per year .	-5.2300
A key reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC circulation from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.4760
Every year in October the four operators of the big electricity routes are re-established .	-5.2638
These indicate the additional costs incurred by the energy transition , which they can impose through a shift over the price of electricity .	-14.4782
The town of Pfullendorf is the last link in this chain .	-2.5998
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher level , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.1247
Now it is time to pay for concrete purposes before the towns could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week .	-6.5715
" We 're going from a 1 cent plus x increase , " said Bias , with the number more close to the 2 cents .	-4.2306
Lightning on permanent red traffic light : Eight waiting time	-5.4403
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not become green .	-2.8190
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is defective .	-2.8370
What do you want to do - drive red ?	-3.2938
If an affected person has waited long enough on a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine " Motorcycle " .	-4.2088
However , the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.7719
Becker advises to insist on at least five minutes before the traffic lights are eliminated .	-20.9566
However , anyone who continues the journey despite redlight must be aware that it bears full blame for an accident caused by it .	-4.5006
Those who are tolerated less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warn Becker and refer to a decision by the Hamm Supreme Court .	-3.9051
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes and had to respond to a negligent breach of redlight .	-4.5068
The traffic light was not defective , but jumped to green slightly later .	-3.9723
A driving ban was spared him because of the particular situation - but not the fine .	-4.4838
Public opinion is delighted about sound budget	-11.9265
When it comes to the budget in community meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-2.8992
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has stopped administration since 2005 .	-3.6403
The 2012 financial year can also be considered a success in this sense .	-3.0032
This became apparent in the presentation of the 2012 annual accounts .	-2.2672
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was higher than planned .	-2.6860
The surplus of the administrative budget is also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-2.4850
The surplus was mainly due to higher trade tax revenue and the share of income tax .	-4.1054
The wealth budget was also clearly higher than the planned values .	-3.6831
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-1.6715
" This is essentially the higher administrative budget , " said Rothmund .	-2.8811
Because fewer investments were made in the 2012 financial year than planned , the recovery rate would also be higher .	-5.6773
Overall , the general backlog has increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-3.2456
Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-2.4573
" You don 't simply shake off the sleeves , " Love Gerster looking at the annual calculation .	-18.0294
He and local councils are pleased with the good figures .	-2.7579
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon cost dearly .	-3.4895
In the past , the community was able to avoid high levels of funding .	-5.7816
In turn , according to the Gerster , grants have already been cut from the country .	-3.9208
These grants are subject to various compensatory kilns .	-4.0133
Amongst other things , cities and municipalities applying for grants must provide certain levels .	-4.9516
" We need to look at the issue of lifting beats , because investments in the coming years are up for which we would like to have grants , " said Gerster in this context .	-7.6425
Nagold : Hugo Wermter has been in the chorus for 60 years .	-2.3989
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter 's history is nearly twice as long as the autumn festival was solemnly honored by the men singer Caecilia .	-4.8910
Hubert Wermter was on stage as usual in the colors of his men 's anguish .	-3.0972
Even after 60 years , his singing still makes great fun with the choir that has now been won .	-5.4418
Wermter was also active in the association , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-2.0447
He received several awards for his commitment and his association : Jörg Kohr , Pastoral Reference on behalf of the Rottenburg-Stuttgart civil association , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an Honor Bishop Gebhard Print signed .	-5.5764
His singer colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German Choral Association as well as a gravest tinter .	-5.2745
In addition to the honour , the 31st autumn festival ran into familiar railways : the MGV Betra , the song sick of salt stettes , the Baisingen singer and the local music association , the Fullmaringer loaded a colourful mixture of different choirs and vocal styles , which had maintained around 400 visitors .	-7.9476
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In Wine Paradise " and " Music , Your Brothers " .	-4.1491
Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts " Bundeslied " , their honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared a small booth in honour .	-5.2618
The Betra Betra also sang classic choir songs like " Hunter Acquisition " by Julius Wengert , " Weit , far away " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-5.7243
The songwriter Salzstetten created the female quota with his mixed choir and his female group - the " Impulschor " - for the fema.	-4.8772
The mixed choir abducted by the Napolitan people " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " from Antos Gus to foreign countries , while the " impulchor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " belonged to their programme .	-4.7751
The singer department of Baisinger Sportverein returned to Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts " Bierlied " , where the Fullmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree .	-5.5987
For the kids there was a small side program - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer put up a castle theatre and read a few stories that children employed the lunch .	-5.7289

Kenyan press outrages controversial media law	-1.7814
“ We are in a frightening situation , and we can ask ourselves what stops Parliament from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow , ” was reading in the newspaper that considers the draft law to be unconstitutional .	-5.5665
“ The law is draconian and very punishable , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , CEO of the Capital Group , which also includes CapitalFM , one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya . , in , , in , , in , in the .	-14.4972
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.6997
“ I hope the President stops us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.6925
According to The Star newspaper , the government , through the new law , “ effectively embraces the media in a stranglehold , ” whereas The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of speech in Kenya wrote “ a serious blow , ” calling it “ draconian . ”	-5.8194
The adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists to the Western Gate Shopping Centre in September .	-3.5109
The Kenyan media moved to the wrath of the authorities , because they published recordings of security cameras on which to see how the units posted at the site allegedly exposed the luxurious shopping centre .	-5.1743
Head of police David Kimaiyo responded to this by interrogating two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the submission was withdrawn after the media crash .	-4.8324
According to the new law , media houses with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation .	-3.8343
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected unless a penalty is paid .	-2.6215
According to Daily Nation , “ one penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.0636
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a destructive impact on Kenya ’ s description of “ lively blogosphere . ”	-2.6912
If they silence the media , politicians could do with impunity whatever they want .	-2.5766
“ Nobody is ever experienced , ” Mutuma Mathiu , journalist at the nation that calls the Kenyan media a a decisive factor of control in public life .	-4.3406
“ If politicians are left to themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy and return us to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-3.9734
Kenyan legislators have raised the public anger in the past .	-1.5638
In May , they voted to reverse the cuts ordered by the national compensation committee and re-imposed their fragile salaries of about 532,000 shilling on tax free per month – they are among the highest in the world .	-5.5228
Bad Dürrrheim : A dream is true for the FC .	-2.0360
The official celebration of the Kunstrasse Square was not sufficient for the city and the football club , despite the cold weather and rain .	-5.4586
A pleasant celebration hour had probably all wished last Saturday , but Peter did not want to play with .	-3.4514
Thus , all those who came out without a rain screen or could not hold one for any reason .	-4.9212
This went to the musicians who surrounded the celebration , as did some speakers .	-4.7988
West was therefore also the FC chairman Albrecht Schlenker , who spoke of fulfilling a dream .	-3.4275
His thanks go primarily to Mayor Walter Klump , who has worked hard to implement the project , to the local council , to the companies and associates involved who have contributed .	-5.8780
Here , especially Lothar Held , Paul Weizenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .	-2.2195
The equivalent pensioners laid 400 square meters of plaster for the new routes .	-3.6416
This remarkable voluntary commitment was also acknowledged by Karl Rombach , .	-13.4552
Other greeting words spoke for the urban sports committee Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office , who announced a donation for the youth department of the club .	-5.3083
Mayor Klump reminded us that recurring weather-related influences in the spring and autumn to put the original lawn place so that it could not be played .	-3.9708
Fifteen years ago , we had the first thoughts on resolving the problem when we thought of building a third place at the grounds of the club or at the Salinensee Real School .	-5.7244
Both have been rejected .	-0.8478
Six years ago , there were ideas about the creation of a Kunstraßplatz , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .	-4.8360
Specific plans were accepted two years ago , when the FC took over the levels in inheritance , committed a cost sharing of EUR 100 000 to build the place , and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000 .	-6.4589
In October 2012 , the council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 in the total cost of EUR 560 000 , Klump summed up .	-3.7280
The construction starts of the 68 times 108 metres above sea level took place on June 4 .	-11.8111

There was a threat of extinction on roads , which are already an accident priority .	-4.9065
The introduction of tolls for all cars would also be Pronolds ’ first step .	-3.7165

Airport Vienna makes calls from passenger .	-2.5774
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-0.7980
By way of saying this , the Vienna-Schwechat Airport will no longer be available in the future .	-5.3513
Much of speakers are thus falling away - noise levels are to be reduced so clearly .	-5.6822
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .	-1.9837
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , the Vienna Airport follows the settlement of transportations affecting individuals , an international trend .	-4.2576
For example , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai have already abandoned noisy calls .	-2.9335
By abandoning these averages - on average , around 200 personal calls by the loudspeakers on a day - it is intended to become more calmer at the airport in the future .	-6.7338
" It was also shown in the experience that these individual turnarounds were relatively little perceived , but at the same time all other information on modified flights or departure times is a bit lost here , " Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-6.3138

In the event of a visit to the café on the opening floor in the Kleve district , to the Rhine-Waal University , it must not remain at the mere Déjà Vu feeling .	-6.9444

" Beautiful , successful and funny " , the two 33 years found .	-2.2708
But it is not everyone 's business .	-2.8862
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a very fan of events either : " You can 't make every right " .	-4.9483

UN announces new poverty reduction targets	-1.9065
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new targets to replace the twelve years ago Millennium Development Goals on Poverty Reduction .	-4.1845
In the run-up to the UN Summit on Sustainable Development , which began in Rio de Janeiro on the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Development Goals that expired in 2015 .	-4.1606
They were included in the final draft document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-3.2308
In the evening , UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon stated at the summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.7783
“ I am delighted that member states have agreed to address a process that is to be agreed to universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-4.2924
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-2.8319
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the member states to realize our vision of the sustainable development goals that build on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.5153
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Oberligists still have a good mood .	-4.3131
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this at all .	-2.9689

However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.2872
" I don 't know how a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-3.8635
Even though the Thirdliga reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet toppled trees , Malmon raises the finger in advance .	-5.1267
Many players I worked on A-youth .	-3.5511
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-13.6050
" Moreover , we need to wait for the first time to reinforce it , " shows the SG coach .	-5.9095
To finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must certainly increase compared to the past .	-3.6656

Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-1.7553
Thousands of people gathered together in the centre of Maputo under the vigilant eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the state founder , and first president of Mozambique , to support peace in a rare public demonstration .	-3.6387
“ We want again peace , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , managing director of an investment company .	-2.7219
From fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her clothing against a T-shirt with the sign “ We demand Security ” in Portuguese and joined the quantity on Thursday in the capital ’ s independence square .	-6.0306
For two weeks now , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst battles since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.7794
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that initially supported the White Rhodesia ruled and later the aparthesis government of South Africa in an effort to destabilise the country ’ s independent government .	-4.2382
Following the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.7116
Analysts think it is unlikely that the country will fall back into a growing conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and natives .	-4.3342
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas reserves in the north-west and coal camps could bring investments of more than $ 50 billion of firms like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko to the US in the coming years .	-5.1770
The ruling Frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for tensions .	-2.3760
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala , a traditional high-burg Renamo province on 17 October .	-16.7773
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated when Renamo ’ s government forces attacked and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , declared Renamo ’ s speaker at the Financial Times .	-4.0517
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-1.9403
President Armando Guebuza has tried to undermine concerns about instability .	-2.2390
On AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama is regarded as a “ loser ” who wants to use “ all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-3.9283
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.9734
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted , Renamo gives up the 1992 peace agreement .	-2.5753
Opposite the FT , he said that Frelimo would no longer respect the agreement .	-3.7999
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-1.3591
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions that have been fired by a number of clashes this year .	-3.4725
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who gather their heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , a lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-12.2386
None of them is good in negotiation and nobody is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.6675
Renamo , who is pressing for electoral reforms , has already stated that it will boycott local elections in November .	-2.8423
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.5978
Some commentators interpreted the use of violence as an attempt by a crucial movement to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.8343
Renamo ’ s electoral sequence has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Movimento Democrático de Moçambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in elections .	-3.6859
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – who will resign if his second term of office ends next year – is to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.2295
“ He doesn ’ t want multi-party democracy , he doesn ’ t want transparent elections , he doesn ’ t want peace because he doesn ’ t want to abandon the presidency , ” said Mazanga .	-2.8210
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made worrying attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection .	-3.2045
Most of the fighting took place in the province Sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , where Beira is located , the port , the mining companies like Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-4.5620
In June , Rio interrupted the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-3.1084
Mazanga replied cautiously to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-2.1489
Renamo wanted to warn “ the international community that things were not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.0617
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media enterprise , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development and recent kidnapping wave .	-3.4183
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the future of the country and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.0827
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.5114
“ No one interested Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-3.4170
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models of life , ” says an author .	-3.1024
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal power has no chance against clever tricks , ” and Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.0668
Many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too frustrated , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland pleaded for a “ careful selection ” of age-righted works .	-4.5951
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklores are already part of education , ” he said .	-1.7664
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years .	-1.7443
He added that in authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ disconnect completely , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would “ undermine . ”	-4.3820
Crossley Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-4.0085
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to communicate hope .	-3.3155
Not everything must be simplified or lead to Happy End , but there is an intangible sense of good and evil .	-2.5239
It must be undermined , history must be revealed and not declared .	-3.6555
This is the old story of the show rather than telling .	-2.6572
Hansjakob is once again drawing to Freihof	-3.0077

With her song " O Jesulin " they enjoy the audience at the outdoor courtyard as well as the store children with their noisy " Heraus , Edinburgh " .	-5.9461

" A troubled mind had finally found his peace and had gone home forever , " it was at the end of the scene .	-14.1357

Court is blocking decision on the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk Directive	-2.9830
A German Appeal Court in the USA blocked on Thursday the order of a judge calling for changes to the Stop-and-Frisk Programme ( “ Inhalation and Search ” ) of the New York Police Department , and disbanded the judge from the case .	-12.0461
The U.S. Appeal Court declared that judge Shira Scheindlin 's decisions would be suspended until a city 's appeal was made .	-4.0426
The judge had judged in August that the city contravenes the constitution with the way in which the program is implemented for the person 's personality and survey .	-5.5409
The city appealed against its assessment and the ordered remedies , including the decision to set up a monitoring centre to support the police in amending their directive and the relevant training program .	-5.0836
The Court of Appeals heard the arguments on Tuesday about the request for suspension .	-11.3883
The appeal report explained that the judge should be abolished by the case , because it violated the code of conduct for US judges , determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of party opinion ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the Court .	-23.4718
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they target black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk programme in an inappropriate way .	-4.0912
She appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and set up a pilot program with cameras registered on the body in quarters in which most controls were carried out .	-4.8444

In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities submitted a complaint that became a collective action .	-4.3539
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop-and-Frisk programme , changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other police presidencies use the regulation .	-4.2377
Opponents take the view that changes would dampen police morals , but not crime ; money would also be wasted and the wider problem of a police that would not be solved under pressure after the removal of thousands of posts over the last decade .	-5.4130
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-hairdress practice , which was constitutional , but reformed only the type of implementation of the controls by the NYP. the of the the was .	-18.1285

Coulson created telephone hacking for checking a tip .	-2.8741
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson supposedly used “ telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair of then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke .	-3.9863
Andrew Edis QC stated to the court in the Old Bailey , News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive Special Adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.3774
The newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire ’ s private detective to hack Pawlbys Voicemails , and persecuted them , but Coulson called them and left news , as the court left .	-4.4343
“ In the opinion of the Public Prosecutor , Coulson , who is now editor of NotW , nobody who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to stop it freshly , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their response , ” Edis explained .	-5.3451
He said that NotW uses three methods to research stories investigatively : telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation .	-2.8839
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.1347
Obviously he knows of the second , the supervision , but it cannot be the other way .	-3.7694
What about the first ?	-1.1176
Does he know of the phone hacking ?	-11.4651
He disputes this , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-2.5661
Rums about an affair clarkes were taken up first by NotW ’ s feature editor , when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Don ’ t waste your time , she is associated with Charles . ”	-4.4227
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was assured in Mulcaire 's apartment in August 2006 .	-2.8892
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective where Pawlby and their sisters were stored as “ projects . ”	-3.0429
At the time the searches went , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls in which they were asked for information about them , Edis explained .	-3.6757
Meanwhile , former Chief Executive Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised monitoring of the movements of Pawlby .	-2.7688
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-3.8751
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities on this story followed the same pattern as with other major figures , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-3.5467
The words heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman for an affair when he was living with the co-defendant Rebekah Brooks , who was married at that time .	-4.1369
Coulson and Brooks dispute having spoken to others to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-3.2771
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the phone hacking .	-1.8013
From protests against the planned rich tax , the French football will actually run through the first strike since 1972 .	-3.4838
A conciliation meeting is coming to an end without result .	-3.1306
In the conflict over the rich tax , the government and the professional football in France , after a failed settlement , took a dead end .	-3.7156
President François Hollande received association and association representatives on Thursday at the Parisian <unk>lysée-Palace , and also in complaint.	-3.8652
He refused to spare football from the planned 75 % levy on incomes of more than one million euros per year , which should pay all firms in the country for two years from 2014 .	-3.9488
The reverse side also remained hard .	-2.6811
The strike announced at the end of November will now be brought through , with the head association of the professional clubs ( UCPF ) , Jean-Pierre Louvel .	-3.9640
The game days in Ligue 1 and Ligue 2 , scheduled between November 29 and December 2 , are thus falling .	-3.7572
Change : No absolute protection possible	-1.4031
" We want to involve the inhabitants early in the planning " , Mayor Jens Häußler opened the Civil Information Event for the flood protection concept in Geichingen .	-4.4779
Around 80 participants had entered the community hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and introduce ideas .	-4.1249
Häußler made it clear : " Ultimate decisions are taken by the members of the municipal Council . "	-4.1864
The flooding water , which met unprepared on 15 May 2009 , was a major event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , according to Häußler .	-5.4331
A river base study was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-4.9967
" Protecting as many built plots as possible is the goal , " said Häußler .	-4.5748
The planning of protection against a German weather service statistically takes place every 100 years to expect flood .	-3.2632
Climate change is due to a 15 % surcharge .	-2.7415
In specialists this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-2.4658
The water masses that had caused considerable damage in Chinges in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood .	-4.5102
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " said housers .	-3.6093
In order to protect HQ 100a climate , some four million euros need to be invested in brain , with the community expecting approximately 70 % of national subsidies .	-4.9157
Häußler pointed out , however , that it only exists when an overall approach is implemented .	-4.1720
This requires the community to participate in the public .	-3.5974
An expensive planning and authorisation procedure must be completed .	-2.1785
In the best case , implementation could start in 2016 .	-1.8803
Among other things , the concept of protection , which was presented in the local council last week ( we reported ) , envisaged local measures in the influence of the river Irm from the Headquarters Valley .	-5.5182
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to make their requests .	-3.2325
Among other things , it has been called into question why no more dams and restraint basins are planned to protect the place .	-3.9047
Gregor Kühn , Specialist Planner of the Representative Engineering Agency Forest and Corbe from Hillsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that it needs the interplay of all the measures presented to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-5.2586
Moreover , it is necessary to find the most economic solution , Joachim woods and Corbe says .	-4.6320
Unfortunately , there were ancient suppliers who , even in the case of normal weather rains , always suffer from overloading the channel network .	-8.1057
The problem is known about the administration and the first measures have already been taken .	-2.5137
Häußler pointed out , however , that the guidelines for channel systems were different than for flood protection and should not be mixed .	-4.8260
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rainy events could be handled .	-3.7857
More dimensional sewage channels would cover millions .	-3.7027
Serious Injuries After Collision	-2.9299
On the early Friday afternoon , 44 near Revensdorf , two drivers were seriously injured at a frontal collision .	-3.4095
The police immediately blocked the street completely , but could say little first to the accident .	-4.4500
However , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated .	-2.8715
It is clear that the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW Golf went in the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf joined her hyundai .	-4.5048
Both vehicles collapsed together , with the wife tilted so hard that the fire brigade needed just half an hour to get rid of it .	-6.1982
The true accident cause remained unresolved .	-3.0192
Both accidents came in nearby hospitals .	-2.5700
The course remained fully locked for about two hours .	-2.6464

" They are convinced that their son was murdered , " Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , said to FoxNews.com.	-2.6018

“ They believe that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics and common sense , ” said Crump .	-4.3520

CDC Publish Allergic Guidelines for Schools	-2.0786
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of directives on how to deal with food allergies for children at schools .	-2.7167
These are the first such directives that the US Government has issued , as the number of school children with food allergies increases .	-3.2465
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.7318
According to CDC , the dissemination of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.5751
The guidelines contain information for schools , which should raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions .	-4.0583

Parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender undetermined ”	-1.7047
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with non-clear genitals .	-3.3579
Newborne is no longer assigned to be male or female .	-3.8240
According to the new law , parents no longer need to declare a gender for such children , but can indicate “ indefinite ” or “ not fixed ” on the birth certificate .	-4.7458
The purpose of the law is to exert pressure from parents , so that they do not have to take excessive decisions regarding sexual allocation for newborns , and combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-5.4089
An intersexual person said later , according to BBC , “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.6655
I remain mutilated and scared .	-1.8098
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children each year does not come as a boy or a girl .	-3.1562
They are among the intersexuals , a group falling under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation ” ( DSD ) , a concept for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( eggs or hods ) or unusually developed genitals .	-5.0204
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.1043
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before choosing , if anything , an operation .	-5.0952
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in the problems of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds a good thing ” .	-3.5111
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-0.9957
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not apply , ” he said .	-2.7630
You can assign a sex without operation and wait for identity to develop .	-3.6272
The scientific data about how a child develops its gender identity at all are not very precise .	-2.6800
No one knows why .	-1.1979
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.7777
A report to the European Commission dating back to 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished by transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender , but because their biological constitution is not exclusively male or female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-5.1384
These characteristics were reflected in vast sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , chromosom structures and hormones .	-4.7205
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination facing intersexual and transgender people in professional life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-3.3418
Not with the gender image is now a special camp .	-3.6405
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to indicate on official documents male , female , or “ third gender . ”	-3.1531

In neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , so a message about France 24 .	-3.1114
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.4282
The US Catholic Online website has also opposed German law , explaining that “ When the world is distorted into a new state , where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we are twice more pillars of civilisation . ”	-5.3718
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone , it would be better if babies were allocated a gender at birth .	-2.7654
“ The parent is already stressful enough without any restrictions , especially if you do not know the sex of your own children , ” she said to the parent website .	-5.1179
Children need stability and security .	-0.5201
Historically , children born with both male and female gender parts were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek God , who had both sexes .	-3.0383
Still ten years ago , medicine regarded the gender as something that could be wiped out and then reconstructed .	-12.9955
In the meantime , the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned , after it is now known how complex the gender identity is , and doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels when it grows up with the gender that they allocate .	-6.2585
“ In the mid-twentieth century , one called it a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-2.5116
When such a child was born , one called the psychiatrist , but the surgeons .	-3.0288
The ruling theory about the treatment of children with non-clear genital goes back to Dr John Money from John ’ s Hopkins University , who took the view that gender was formable .	-4.2208
He coined the term “ gender identity ” and argued that social and environmental offences – such as parents achieve a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , characterizing whether a person viewed himself as male or female .	-15.6773
But his theories were controversial in a case of 1966 under the title “ John / Joan . ”	-3.4334
He asked the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated when a bold circumcision had been cut off , to castrate the child completely and also to remove his soils and then brought him up as a girl .	-6.9817
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a transformation that he was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.1673
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to male sex and married a woman .	-1.9386
At 38 but he committed suicide .	-2.1946
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.3072
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the Internet , survivors of these sex operations have come to the public , which are “ not happy with the result . ”	-4.0080
For example , for Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author of Montana , who was born with XY-male chromosomes but ambiguous genitals . in , , in , in , , in . , in ,	-11.7905
Doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitorist or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man .	-3.8453
His external organ and the Hoden were therefore surgery removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was granded as girls .	-4.9319
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.3945
" I knew I am not a girl , " he explained to ABCNews.com	-19.3557
I was unfortunate , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.5194
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-2.2418
But , as he was depressive and knew that something was not right , he asked for his medical acts .	-2.8165
What he found out was shocking .	-0.5242
I was sterilised at my birth – and nobody has ever said so to me .	-2.7714
Bruce was born with a DSD that could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genital .	-3.1807
After learning the truth , he moved back to male identity , received testosterone injections , and was removed from his breasts .	-13.8973
Through the operation it has become infertile . in . , , in , in . , , in , , ,	-10.2402
Today , he is fighting for others in an organisation called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-2.6302
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of Advocates for Informed Choice , is concerned that German law can “ encourage stamps and stigmatize ” .	-3.1808
“ Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to take swift decisions and introduce the child to ‘ assign ’ , they declared .	-15.1820
We fear that this will benefit from interventions .	-11.0679
We think it would be better to allocate the male or female gender and then wait for them to come .	-3.0213
We do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-1.7985
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognise as a third gender . ”	-2.6720
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she said .	-2.5511
German law is about allocating birth .	-2.6997
This is not a battle to force small children at this stage .	-2.5052
If they are adult , they can decide for themselves about their body .	-3.7704
But Dr Arlene Baratz , a brush diologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says German law “ authorized ” both parents and children .	-3.6050
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD named complete drug resistance .	-2.3513
Female characteristics developed due to the recipe foil of the target cells for testosterone .	-3.0311
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-2.5269
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist .	-3.0126
It is infertile , but hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-2.9631
“ The law gives parents space , so they do not need to make excessive decisions , ” said Baratz .	-3.3671
It gives them the time to test and clarify things , giving them time to write them “ male ” or “ female ” .	-3.8552
In this way , everything is fine – one attracts the child and loves it .	-4.1963
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the parent happiness .	-2.5450
We do not need to hasten an operation that can no longer be undone .	-3.8351
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are raising because they believe they are not doing the right thing , ” explained them .	-4.5428
Ultimately , the child decides about the gender that better suits him – and that is a wonder. , , by , , , , in , . , , ,	-11.9463
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-2.2374
Unknown Injured Girls by Auto Shot	-2.1810
Unknown have injured a twelve years in Saxony-Anhalt for shots from one car .	-3.8307
The perpetrators had probably fired on Thursday evening in Genthin with a weapon of air pressure on a group of children .	-3.4228
This divided the police in Castle .	-3.4576
The girl was easily injured on the left Wade .	-1.7489
Saving forces brought the girl to hospital .	-2.5158
The shot came from a small car that was driven by a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-2.9994
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.5660
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .	-1.9549
A disc broke down .	-1.7030
They then went out of it .	-1.9947
The police determined it on Friday .	-2.4826
Until now , the police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-2.1657
The officials were called only twice for irrevocable children who thrown them against house façades .	-4.4655
Since house owners recognized this in good time and eliminated the egg removal , no factual damage is likely to occur .	-6.2571
Also , some sylvester pellers were burnt in the municipal area , but there was no real damage .	-8.3553
A resident in the Bishof-Friendorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with clopaper and his cycling blenders were deprived .	-6.2652
Until the police arrived , however , the man found his cycling blind people in close proximity , which is why the police did not have to take any further action .	-6.0746
Living with Prospects for the Future	-2.7301
Actually , Waltrud Ries lives dreamy .	-1.9056
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.6160
It is only a few minutes by public transport .	-10.9141
" You are hopefully not afraid of spiders ? " , asks Waltrud Ries and shows a fat spider at the Turkish Tower .	-4.3113
I have been looking for a new flat for my husband and myself for some time now .	-2.0219
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.1215
The reason for this is not a spinning phobia , but the concern that the many stages of the house and the apartment can no longer cope with it is explain.	-6.7043
Furthermore , since a Meniskus operation , the mid-fifties have had to learn on their own body , which means moving around to a floor with handicap .	-5.9062
Only recently is a book of her published on the theme ' Happy living in age - what kind of living is the best for me ? ' .	-4.9426
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not happen at all at age ' , it begins to tell them .	-3.9642
When she moved her husband to the maizonette apartment more than 20 years ago , she was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-3.5867
Today , Waltrude Ries is thinking differently about it in the mid-fifties .	-3.7117
She also knows that she is one of the few people who are dealing with the subject of ' living in age ' .	-4.2613
Most people are forcing for as long as this goes .	-3.1921
Old will always be just the other ' , she says smiling .	-3.1747
Only when suffering pressure is really big is worth considering .	-3.6763
'Then it can be too late ' , Ries said .	-3.0403
In its book , the interior design presents 17 living models for self-determined living at age .	-3.5829
" Which type of home you choose is always an individual decision , " she explains .	-11.4739
D i e solution gives it not for age .	-1.7960
Even those who can afford retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can also become ill .	-3.7039
And : ' Without good knowledge of the country language you can also resemble in the Dolce Vita , ' gives the author the willingness to consider .	-6.5862
Among their models , classic care models , alternative housing forms or the often cited Rentner WG are found .	-4.3744
Everyone has so many ticks and packs at age .	-4.2637
" For me , such a community would be nothing , " she says with an eye-catcher .	-3.6970
Not even like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-4.0729
'At age you simply need your withdrawal rooms ' , according to Ries .	-4.7392
However , the book author does not want to rule out the functioning of a community of seniors .	-3.5132
This should be done differently from the classical student panel .	-5.1880
And sometimes you just want his rest , " she believes .	-3.3291
It is not alone , at least in the state capital .	-13.4957
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment ' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the civil service life at the age of the state capital .	-4.4771
Your department advises people about ' old age ' .	-2.7315
That is why older people would often take inconvenience and restrictions only to remain in their familiar environment , that is also the experience of the Foundation Warentest .	-4.9450
Today , there are many ways of making the house or apartment accessible .	-3.1971
Ries recommends to everyone who deals with the age-oriented reconstruction of their house or apartment , that they should be kept thoroughly informed and not to charge the best craftsman .	-8.2237
Today , we also have specialists for the reconstruction of old age .	-4.6007
Even in the rental apartment , you can realize one or more , and if it is only the toilet heat increase , the interior design explains .	-5.5951
But it is not always possible to convert the existing property according to age and thus to its accessibility , even if it is still so beautiful .	-5.8734
Waltrude Ries had to experience this .	-2.1274
One could install a lift inside the apartment , which also paved with stairs to the housing door but would be a much greater obstacle .	-6.7471
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for her husband and her hus.	-2.6971
Before moving , it 's more gratifying than before the spider of its housing door .	-4.4083
US wants to continue prosecuting Snowden	-2.2308
The US has not changed its position as former US intelligence official Edward Snowden .	-1.9375
He will continue to be accused of sharing unauthorized secret information .	-11.0503
Therefore , in the US , he must face a criminal proceeding , said the spokesman of the US Department of Foreign Affairs , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-4.3028
Recent Snowden statements would not change this either .	-2.7418
Previously , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow not to threaten him any further .	-3.5259
Psaki stressed that there are currents of statements made by a parliamentarian , not a German member of government .	-5.0914
Secret dishwasher Edward Snowden is willing to talk to German authorities in principle .	-3.8392
But first he wants to know his situation clarified .	-2.0476
This has made the US ’ s former NSA staff clear in an unaddressed letter published by Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , Bundestag , and General Federal Prosecutor .	-5.8792
The letter has the following wording following following a translation that is widely used by crowd :	-5.3784
Responsibilities	-1.5168
I have been asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass monitoring .	-2.1987
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and was earlier contracted or employed by a direct position as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-3.4013
In the course of my employment in these institutions , I witnessed the systematic lawbreaking of my government , which prompted me to act on a moral duty .	-4.6937
As a result of publishing these concerns , I saw a serious and persistent heat that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-3.1972
I currently live in exile and enjoy a temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law .	-2.7576
I am encouraged by resonance to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-1.6374
Citizens around the world and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged revelations on a system of overall surveillance that nobody accounts as a service to the public .	-3.3681
These spy revelations entailed many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence .	-3.3660
The benefits to society from these obtained findings are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks associated with purchasing have been clearly .	-5.0234
Although the outcome of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government still treats Dissen as a virus and seeks to criminalise and charge political opinion .	-4.5280
Yet the truth is not a crime .	-1.5212
I am confident that the US Government , with the support of the international community , will adopt this dreadful attitude .	-3.1010
I hope that if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible explanation of the facts relating to the statements made by the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.4404
I look forward to a discussion with you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold the international law that protects us all .	-3.5280

Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-1.4656
" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlingen 's mayor Michael Maier .	-1.8497
The former kindergarten in the Gardenstraße has sold the municipality to a private person .	-2.6956
The municipal council approved the sale in its latest meeting in the non-public section .	-4.6265
The building changed its owner to a " reasonable " price .	-2.1006
" The community is satisfied " , emphasizes Maier .	-2.3265
The budget spent EUR 100 000 .	-2.0781
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former kindergarten .	-2.6059
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has passed responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to pay for the house 's entertainment , as to heat , look after the garden and clean the walk .	-5.7508
" This effort is now away , " Maier is pleased .	-2.2619

Report : Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.4682
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers have thought in secret of replacing Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton , the New York Times .	-2.9519
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-2.9175
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and it reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had conducted “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 , ” in order to find out whether Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election looks better if he drops bids .	-5.8619
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ national correspondent , the book thoroughly endorses the history of the efforts of leading Campaign and White House staff , namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect that it has on polls concerns to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President .	-5.7658
The potential shift was a strictly protected secret in Chicago 's campaign infrastructure and Oval Office .	-2.9873
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s narrowest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and the former senior adviser of the White House , David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew about the intended change .	-12.0870
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley was at the forefront of efforts to exchange bids despite their “ close , personal relationship , ” before deciding to move against such a move , after showing that Clinton ’ s candidacy would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.4139
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.0689
“ I said a whole series of things to be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine .	-2.6493
It is worth remembering that the President had awful surveys at the time , so we thought , ‘ To God ’ s will , what do we do ? ’	-4.9013
While Daley referred to the studies as “ a diligence , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that significant efforts were made during the campaign for re-election to determine whether such a train would pay for the ballot box .	-5.2216
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you are not seriously thinking about something , ” Martin declared AC360 .	-4.1332
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about exchange .	-2.5507
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley whether his then boss had known about the potential change .	-2.6152
While Daley explained that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew it .	-3.8128
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political soldiers had reached a desk .	-2.8159
Cooper asked Martin if he thought seriously that Obama was not aware of the investigations into making bids drop in the elections .	-4.5857
Martin replied .	-1.8940
What happens on the way to my e-mail ?	-1.8807
Email actually means electronic letter .	-1.3070
Was it similar to traditional post secret to the design of the Internet service ?	-4.9518
The focus of the early Internet services was on making communications possible .	-2.5992
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been taken into consideration for creating a stable foundation for a listening change of letters .	-4.6929
Therefore , a conventional email is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-2.8334
If user " Anna " sends an e-mail to " Benni " , are the machines of the two directly connected ?	-2.7144
The Anna e-mail program or browser will send mail to the mail server of their service provider in the first step .	-2.9853
For example , if it has a GMail account , that would be Google .	-2.0813
This mail server sends the content to the provider that uses Benni .	-1.9807
On the track , you can run the mail on a number of other servers on the Internet .	-3.7378
Bennie can then call the content to your provider .	-2.0734
Will traditional emails be read through the network ?	-2.6349
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the move . , , , , , , , , , , , in .	-19.1049
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail leads a damage program as an appendix .	-13.8064
A virus check is also made on the recipient systems .	-2.0815
Moreover , the providers check whether this is a burdensome and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least removed into a spam folder .	-5.5290
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.2493
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.0206
If Anna and Benni communicate with GMail about their upcoming holiday tours , Google can display links to the tourist offers .	-4.4174
Do you also read unknown people the e-mails with ? ! !	-11.6665
The likelihood that unauthorized persons are reading an email is extremely small .	-3.2847
In theory , however , this is possible .	-1.5143
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.1399
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of withdrawing or notifying emails .	-3.7943
In addition , possible illegal phasing-out actions . , , and , with , . , and , , , with .	-15.1617
Is it possible to protect emails against your colleague ?	-2.9330
With a encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against complaints .	-3.9321
With a high technical effort it is also possible to obscure metadata from an email communication so that it is not even easy to detect who has communicated with whom .	-4.2389
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.2417
According to a study of Convios Consulting from August 2013 , Yahoo and Google played a subordinate role in the mainly private postboards .	-4.8537
While the shares of Yahoo mail were last pleased , GMail from Google could clarify .	-3.8474
Mother in the forest goes beyond retirement and pensions are cashing out .	-5.5571
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-1.4516
He grew up in a forest - and continued to cash her pension and care .	-3.4887
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after investigation of the police in the forest .	-3.1953
First , he covered the death of the 89 year-old , then he wrote the money for more than one and a half years .	-5.1486
Now the 67-year-old must respond for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-2.7660
The man hid the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.7782
Suspected the man was already in May : At that time , medicines were no longer needed for the mother in need of care .	-4.3461
The pensioners told the investigators that his mother travelled to Spain .	-2.1290
Because officials were strange in advance , they continued to identify .	-3.8708
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had maintained them last .	-3.7904
After all , the 67-year-old granted the death of his mother .	-2.1860
According to the police , obstruction did not indicate a capital crime .	-2.8675
Are you looking for ice-cream lighting in the dark ?	-2.8886
A British entrepreneur has developed the first light ice in the dark – thanks to quallen .	-4.2004
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animals and thus created a luminous delicacy .	-4.0320
His idea came to him after reading a research on tongues and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the luminous protein .	-5.9038
The ice cream responds to the tongue when consuming , raising the pH value in the protein and triggering the lights .	-3.8072
Chris explains that the food responds to the warmth in the mouth and light – the more you lick , the lighter it will .	-13.5948
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious , ” says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and one receives two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.9318
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with a neutral pH value .	-1.9336
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value and ice illuminates .	-2.7281
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed to us to put it on the market to Halloween , because it has this wonderful light effect . of all this .	-23.1420
It is probably the most expensive ice-cream I 've ever produced , because the microlight is four times more expensive than gold .	-4.0259
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.4035
But for that it is tasty .	-1.8323
Charlie 's experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-2.6449
But his latest creation should become even more ambitious .	-1.7308
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-1.7908
This is impossible in itself due to the breaking of light caused by the ice crystals from which ice creams exist ; but I suspect we can find a way of creating it .	-5.1867
The ice cream uses the fluorescent characteristics of a qualle produced artificially by Chinese scientists .	-3.3060
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League after six days of play .	-12.8200
Now it comes for the Ingo Ehlers team tomorrow to Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-3.8233
With this game the season starts new for us .	-2.1624
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " Ehlers behave optimistically .	-3.1916
Here he finally has his full cader at his disposal , except for the permanent Hendrik Blohme .	-5.4998
Daverden also sets up the pace .	-3.4495
Therefore , we must minimise our error rate .	-2.2219
However , the cover must be enhanced primarily , which has left everything but a safe impression .	-5.3713
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-3.3578
The game was of course a house number .	-0.9386
But that is why we are far from favorite , because everything can happen in the Derby .	-3.6289
However , Panitz wants to look for Morsum to start a series .	-3.5530
Failure will be Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.4631
For this , the A Jugendliche Jost Windsuss , who is active with double playing rights at the A-youth limestone HC Bremen , is celebrating his season debut .	-6.5156
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.4843
Halloween 2013 : In Numbers	-1.0139
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.1859
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress us for the neighbourhood .	-2.6170
Today I became a Halloween buffel .	-3.6093
In the last two years I have not explained to distribute my apartment from sweets , and I think it will not do so this year either .	-4.2283
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep in Halloween .	-2.4997
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , such as the US Retailers ’ Association ( NRF ) .	-3.2870
One thing I am pleased to see every Halloween again is the trend values .	-3.8947
The costumes will account for about $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NGF .	-2.9458
This year , exciting unlived items are the last cry .	-3.9477
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothing ; they can now also embody tempting food such as pizza , hamburger or carotts .	-4.8200
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the jft-punk space men will create it this year in the instagram feeds .	-3.8047
According to Google , most of the costumes are zombies , Batman , pirates and witches .	-2.8550
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.7066
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone to my surprise .	-3.2320
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , such as the NGF .	-2.3319
These are a lot of “ hot dogs ” .	-2.3739
As far as sweetness is concerned , we are not shy .	-3.0411
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , The Nielsen Company .	-1.3784
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , lutchers , bonbons and rubber bears .	-2.9844
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Trade Department , who are pulling through the quarters by saying “ sweets or sauces . ”	-4.1928
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and , let us not mind , eat .	-3.1941
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms are sold around Halloween , the National Association of sweet producers .	-3.4127
That is about nine billion mask grains .	-2.3389
It is a mystery that I could not solve yet .	-1.6453
Nothing is more part of Halloween than houses where it sprays .	-2.8475
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-2.2423
In fact , there are 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States that achieve $ 500 million revenue , America Haunts says , and this includes the wonderful photographs on which one can pink up in the trousers and then place friends on Facebook , where they are not going to get rid of them again , and one of the type on which you are standing will leave a comment like “ nice face expression . ”	-8.6845
But finally we come to the cuts .	-2.9873
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Spring when we were children , and the cutting of a springboard is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we made from small ones .	-4.8886
Fortunately , the “ Baby in the Kurbis ” trend only began last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us have grown up in sitting the shortcuts and not sitting in them .	-5.5958
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on cumbers , the US Census Bureau .	-2.2076
The pumpkin slowly rotting in the pregarden is probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms were harvested this year .	-4.5304
If you want to put right , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut some hints from their 921 kilo of heavy cumbers .	-4.0222
Housing fire in Helmbrechts : rescue forces mount crafted corpses	-5.3447
The fire brigade had to return to Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening .	-3.9459
A three-family house in the district of Hof starts at night to fire on Friday .	-13.3495
The rescue forces have a paid corpse from the house .	-4.3288
In the case of a fire in Helmbrecht , rescue forces have found a collected body in a three-family house .	-5.3185
Whether it was a resident is still unclear , as a speaker from the police in Bayreuth said .	-2.9173
It was burnt on the ground floor of the house late on Thursday evening .	-2.6018
When the fire fighter arrived , the flames were already out of a window .	-4.1426
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-3.8828
This room and another one burned out completely .	-3.7105
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.6608
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police spokesperson continued to exp.	-3.1048
The building cannot be inhabited for the time being .	-3.6646
First , the precise cause of the fire was not clear .	-2.3613
Germany ’ s largest country church has an offensive way to advertise the profession of the pastor .	-3.1147
Background is a potential parish deficit : the Gospel and Lutheran Church of Hanover estimates that the number of pastors currently about 1,800 will halve by 2030 .	-5.4098
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical press service .	-14.6174
It is attractive to determine the course of the work and the daily life .	-3.8918
With Burfien , the Landeskirche has for the first time ordered a full pastor to inspire young people for the theology study .	-13.0088
Currently , fewer and fewer young people choose the abitute to study theology .	-3.4636
Burfia returns this to the process of deciralization : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.2070
It is the profession of great freedom and diversity .	-2.6207
I am Mr My calendar and can focus my attention where it is important to me .	-4.2372
Pastors could be a pastor very close to the people .	-3.0701
They deserve as much teachers as they can live well .	-2.8358
To be sure , the free economy is paid more , but theologists would have a safe employer .	-4.0851
This is coming to fruition with the young people of today who are not only concerned with careers but with a sense of reality .	-6.0311
According to the State Church , which covers three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are currently retiring each year .	-3.4039
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study begin their vicariat .	-3.5741
In sparsely populated areas such as resins , the Emsland , or the Wendland , it will be difficult to fill jobs in future .	-4.1724
Burfien , among other things , wants to organise days of study for young people and invite celebrities studying theology .	-5.1360
The theological study offers broad education .	-3.1963
It can even become the Federal President .	-3.3599
Land Rover Rally Series announced a new announcement .	-2.8675
In the interior you will find racing seats and six-point belts as well as a leisure facility .	-4.0514
The options range from enhanced brakes , a service package supporting Bowler workshops mechanics and logistical support to vehicle instorage between events .	-4.3656
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.6744
They are not all experienced race drivers , but people who are looking for tension and adventure as well as after a reachable way to world class events .	-4.4542
We are happy to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare new ones for the straps and reality of Rally Raid .	-4.9958
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship .	-3.0337

Firebruary to rescue an intruder that was fixed 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock head in a stone break .	-6.0003
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was evolved after a smaller traffic accident .	-2.9101
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in a stone break in her miserable location .	-3.9999
Firefighters died on a rock wall and saved the dog from safe death .	-4.1444
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing into security an alliance that was fixed on a 15 metre high head in a rock wall .	-5.9568
The nine months old cocker Spaniel-Hündin Ruby went off after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before it was saved on Wednesday from a stone break .	-4.3817
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 who belonged to the dog , came to the stone break of flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.7972
They had desperately sought their missing wildlife and released assistance calls into social networks when she was in the stone after the small traffic accident .	-5.9342
About 14 : 15 am Wednesday , a walker who executed his dog , stranded Ruby on the 15 metre high sales in stone break .	-5.5941
The Cleckheaton Fire Station ’ s technical rescue team held to rescue Ruby , which was then transported upwards in a dog box .	-14.4977
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical bailout team , said : “ It was in a dangerous situation .	-2.7760
It was in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from above and the ground .	-2.3378
She did not move muscles during her salvation – she was as freezing as .	-2.6484
But now she is doing good .	-2.1951
She then felt a few dog cakes .	-3.3594
That was quite unusual .	-2.6362
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.2764
Peter Lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a giant happiness . ”	-2.2397
It was possible that it was very hard to injure or worse .	-2.3270
Ruby was brought to the veterinary to the investigation , but he did not notice anything other than exhaustion and dehydration .	-3.7732
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ At the rescue was frightening . ”	-3.0295
I could not believe that she really was up there .	-2.6823
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-1.5633
The veterinary explained that if exhaustion had become too big and collapsed it would probably have crashed .	-3.4942
The fire fighters have done great things .	-2.0686
It was really courageous what they did .	-1.9337
We are just so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.2746
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that she would fall down , but she remained above . ”	-12.8335
The fire fighters were great .	-1.2047
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.3375
Mick Jagger explained that he never made Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.3285
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop-star said that she worked as a background singer to hunter ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” in 2004 .	-12.3885
Perry explained that she had eaten with the Aldryer in the evening , and that " he caught me when I was 18 " .	-4.3889
She added : “ It has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.7563
In a statement , a representative said Haggers , 70 , on Thursday that he “ denied categorically that he had ever attempted to bring this approach to Katy Perry . ”	-4.5413
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.2754

George Kerevan : European Unbundling gives the Scots the choice	-1.6783
A new day , a new terrible story about independence .	-1.7943
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-1.8408
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian Wall .	-2.9170
Indeed , the Strathclyde template referred to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel to the rest of Europe , but , as expected , it did not matter in the headlines .	-4.8658
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often accept their strict rules when it is more favourable to them .	-4.2710
Since Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area , the continued failure for Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what we really want from the Scots .	-15.6757
So there is no story . . . . , . , , , . , , , , ,	-11.1960
And one that has already come so in the years that she is already like a fossil : the first time I heard “ independence means passport controls ” -enthusiasm at least 40 years ago .	-5.2457
This is an interesting point in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-3.2516
Why should one expect an independent Scotland to dance to the European pipe ?	-15.7421
Why exchange the London yoke against Brussels , especially now ?	-2.3242
These are the real news of Europe : the large plan for unification of Europe following the war has stalled .	-3.4888
The euro crisis has officially died Europe .	-2.3780
Parties across the EU are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to aboard the euro as a common currency .	-3.6602
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party ’ s alternative for Germany – founded this year – was able to hold nearly five million votes in the German election in September , thus effectively driving Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-5.2454
There has always been domestic resistance to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.5817
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-0.8983
Because of the rigorous austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the national economy is needed by maintaining the common currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.1095
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – that was the case only in Greece .	-1.5842
Instead , the Eurosystem has confirmed its members at exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians want to let them do . with , .	-17.9420
Without the possibility of local currency devaluation , southern Europe will find itself with an integrated productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-3.2530
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – sported by Berlin .	-2.5057
A deeper European productivity problem lies behind the current budget and currency problems .	-3.0118
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and gas compared to the United States .	-3.5558
This is a paralyzing cost disadvantage , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.4026
All the world ’ s wage sentences do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-3.5832
As a result , a revolt is being drawn up , especially in France , the former EU cheerleader .	-3.0943
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and lift Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.0728
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe up its own economic policy , which has to struggle with the battled French economy .	-5.1610
The result is that Marine Le Pen 's right-wing anti-EU front National has just won a decisive re-election , pointing the governing socialists to three .	-4.7170
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot expect to split in the right spectrum would automatically benefit the left .	-3.7446
What makes Le Pen popularity among the working-class white French ?	-3.2034
It wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.0819
If the anti-EU parties perform well in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.3205
This is the point I want to make : in the not-too-distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-4.0144
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of the ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-2.7453
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-1.7455
I expect the United Kingdom to distance itself from this project in the hope of intervening in the United States .	-3.0820
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain will stand alone in the Atlantic rain .	-2.0611
Where does Scotland stay in all this ?	-2.0750
We can decide to be a region of ( in the last consequence ) small England .	-2.0754
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including Berlin and Brussels – what they can hide behind .	-2.3270
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a easier European association if we retain our own currency .	-3.8076
Cooperation with other countries that think similarly is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-3.1235
Otherwise we should consider doing the same thing as Norway and retaining our economic independence .	-2.2271
The SNP administration in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and in 2011 has gained a spectacular majority , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister , Alistair Darling , and the subsequent Tory Lib dem coalition .	-4.4476

Early Puberty : Faster Adults	-2.1561
African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age groups , as inquiries show .	-3.1917
Physical changes do not mean immediate puberty yet .	-3.5312
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible for this .	-1.5972
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty .	-1.5859
The early puberty trend is less pronounced by boys .	-1.5876
The former CNN correspondent , Pat Etheridge , is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-17.2114
Should a mother be concerned when their daughter grows at seven or eight years of breasts and shame ?	-2.9809
At the annual conference of the Children ’ s Association of American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , Pediatric Endokrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal under American girls and a new standard .	-3.5665
“ I spend a lot of time calming parents – usually that is not a sign that the puberty is now entering fast , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-4.2130
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame and hairs as well as body smell , are seen earlier in girls .	-4.4345
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of the Menarch ( incidence of the first bleeding ) over the last 40 years .	-4.2113
In the United States , the average age age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.0040
“ When the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the menarch , ” Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early Puberty in girls : the essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-4.8115
Time is the most accurate test of how the puberty goes on .	-2.8229
There is controversial about what actually is the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early ” when breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost aged eight years ago .	-5.0380
In most cases , the process is slowing down or stagnant – something that a child can closely monitor .	-3.2928
Tests by an endicronologist could be shown to avoid serious problems such as tumour or cysts .	-16.5602
There are treatments for delaying an early menstruation and preventing another consequence : the premature ageing of bones that can ultimately lead to growth inhibition and thus small growth in adults .	-6.2258
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and emotional maturity .	-3.8859
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.4834
Kaplowitz is restrained in terms of medicines , but he acknowledges that “ suppressing puberty can mitigate behavior problems and feelings of girls , unlike their retirees . ”	-5.1115
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.6247
“ They worry about pregnancy risk or how they handle the hygienic side , ” Kaplowitz said .	-2.5565
“ It was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter received ten days .	-2.5978
Although there were first signs and we spoke about menstruation , it was emotionally not prepared .	-2.5002
She was frightened and excited from school home because she was the first in her friendship .	-13.2572
There are many widely published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.0035
But there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be cause .	-3.1487
Young are similar to girls in puberty earlier .	-2.9321
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is obesity epidemic .	-1.8282
He supported carrying out a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years , which establishes a link between body fat and entry into puberty .	-3.7133
Other investigations support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-1.9364
In that country , African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white pensioners .	-2.8767
There are different explanations for this .	-1.5138
Globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .	-2.9391
Another mystery : Although boys grow hairs of face and shame earlier , the trend to a full-scale previous puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .	-4.6226
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-1.7445
The emergence of acne and shame hair is spread even among babies and young children .	-2.7468
“ We need to be careful about identifying the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-2.8723
Parents should not hesitate to get advice from their doctor on how they should speak to their child .	-3.2110
“ This can mean that you should have a discussion earlier than expected , ” Kaplowitz righted .	-4.2941
When you remain calm , the child usually reacts fine .	-2.9110

Jumbo manufacturers are fighting in the face of large orders over seat width .	-3.3876
There has been a debate on the width of long-haul seats among leading aircraft manufacturers , indicating the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.3770
The dispute revolves around the sitting width offered by passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who seek to carry out airlines most , but this proven space is the key to the efficiency assertions in the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-7.0972
Airbus demanded an industry standard this week , requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inch ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that airlines should decide . , , , in , , in in the , in in . , in , in , in , in ,	-18.1900
The fight comes at a time when aircraft farmers compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul aircraft and expect record orders from November 17 to 21 .	-4.7797
How the back part of the aircraft is equipped – especially whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the given economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design will deliver .	-4.8421
Boeing claims that its modernised “ 77X ” will grant 406 people in tourist class seats over 17 inches wide , thus allowing ten per line .	-6.2119
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-14.6772
Aircraft giants often share love about technical details by advertising in the specialist press .	-3.4918
Now Airbus appeals in front of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X will likely make the race directly to the public with over 100 orders .	-3.6898
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new war of advertising and donors showed an image in which three people sit together in a restaurant , and the title : ‘ would you accept that ? ’	-6.0299
“ Boeing proposes long-range flights in seats that are closer to regional turbo props , ” says Airbus Chairman John Leahy .	-3.1084
Faced with modified diet habits , people are getting thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically . in the .	-12.4066
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing defined the modern long-haul journey in 747 , and the weight of the male average American between 40 and 49 years increased by ten % , the US Ministry of Health data .	-4.4870
The waist size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm , according to US health statistics .	-3.0453
Airbus says that his rival was kept to a 1950s concept when the average size of the freshly baptized Jet Set was narrower .	-4.3452
Airbus carried out studies showing that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased the sleep quality by 53 % .	-4.1926
Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus regarding seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between fares and equipment .	-4.4093
The company also explains that , according to investigations , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the width of the seat .	-13.4694
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains Kent Craver of Boeing .	-4.4609
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.0581
They know their business better than any other .	-1.5649
For passengers , freedom of misery is at stake , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly a subject that can affect sales .	-4.8468
A race for aircraft orders , estimated at least $ 700 billion in listing prices in the coming decades , may have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-4.7297
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the confrontation over the new jets .	-3.1214
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 % more efficiency per seat at their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.4896
The Boeing statements on the results are partly dependent on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-4.3056
Increased costs per unit are still lower than the number of machines currently used with ten seats per row .	-4.1665
“ Boeing therefore crosses more seats into his aircraft to make it more competitive with our products ” , says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at the European Airbus .	-3.7098
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per series of existing 777 pointed out that many passengers decided on the closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-4.1024
“ Eighteen customs seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin equipment , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-3.2658
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose from .	-2.6098
World-wide jet vendors even wear bandmass in themselves to measure the facility for competition .	-5.7806
Even if they price the comfort , all manufacturers also offer highly compressed equipment for cheap airlines and regional flights .	-4.2694
Airbus offers an A350 of ten seats , but , according to its own statement , it has not yet sold it .	-4.1133
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability for the cabins and offered broad seats for some jets .	-4.0028
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts are saying that the reputation for a new industry standard might probably be pushed , but distract from the wave of 77X sales .	-4.0116
New anti-nicotine vaccines could yield to pleasure in smoking .	-2.8927
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-2.0347
Mäuse has been able to protect one dose of the vaccine for life from nicotine addiction .	-3.6240
Further attempts are needed to test human beings , which can take a few years to come , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Well Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-4.4847
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccine strategy can once help millions of smokers who tried to stop while testing all the methods available on the market , but experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than those approaches , ” says Cornell .	-4.5390
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed so that it contains genetic information about the manufacture of nicotine antibodies .	-3.3259
The virus infects selectively the liver cells , which then produce a permanent flow of antibodies .	-2.4858
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which means that a smoker does not experience nicotine high .	-3.6730
Vaccinated mice , administered by Nicotin , retained its normal level of activity .	-3.4393
Mouse without vaccination , on the other hand , would have taken a “ time , ” explained the researchers , a sign that the nicotine had reached its brain .	-4.2273
Experiments are described in the specialist sheet Science Translational Medicine .	-2.6041
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.4296
The vaccination had to be so often given to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-2.9128
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories . the of , , , in , , , in , , in .	-12.2181
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is quite certain , could be administered before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine .	-4.3757
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-1.2938
“ You know , when they start smoking again , they no longer feel pleased about the nicotine vaccine , which helps them to take the habit , ” he explains .	-4.9002
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but warned at the same time that further research was necessary .	-2.9337
Tripodi disputes having been influenced by Obeid	-1.8995
The former Lab Laboratory Minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales begins an investigation by the government ’ s corruption record .	-4.8401
The former NSW minister disputes changing the maritime packaging arrangements to his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had hidden participations in three properties in state-controlled land .	-5.6213
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC Independent Commission against Corruption ) expanded its investigations into the question of whether Obeid had influenced various Ministers of State , pacht contracts at the Circular Quay , where Obeids operated two restaurants and a café , with no tender after their expiration in August 2005 .	-7.3221
Now is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi knew obeids ’ obscured interest in the property after Tripodi ’ s former deputy chief Lynne Ashpole said accordingly on Thursday .	-5.3306
In years of talks that started in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for pacht contracts .	-3.0583
The backgrounds were opposed to this and also wanted longer runtime .	-4.6676
In 2009 , the Circular Quay pacht contracts for companies brought in the obeids annually to $ 2.5 million were extended without public ten.	-4.8212
Tripodi , who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , was originally in favour of public tenders .	-3.0944
But he disputes having made the changes to Pitt Obeid , who , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for the government ’ s pache regulations to be transformed .	-5.7360
One of the ICAC ’ s telephone records showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi , and Steve Dunn , a senior official who changed to the Ministry of Port after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-4.8134
“ Was the issue raised in these telephone calls about the preparation of commercial packaging rules ? ” , Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-4.7375
“ No , ” Tripodi responded .	-1.4784

Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to “ genuine test ” .	-2.6024
The government is considering , within the framework of extended measures , a “ real test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-3.7250
If the test is introduced , it would be used over a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to occupy unqualified jobs or as a back door for the influence of family and friends to Australia .	-4.1017
Today , a proposal for a discussion has been published by the government , after the former Labor Party Laboratory MEPs , Maxine McKev , condemned the government 's comments on foreign workers because they could be seen as an insult by Australia 's neighbours .	-5.4577
“ Volume statements like foreigners are supposed to hit behind ‘ and , first , Australians are a very uncomfortable retreat in times when unions demand a protected labor market , ” they told the Australia India Institute today .	-5.9023
Historically , white workers were to be protected – and if some in the region admire this historical artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.2033
The proposal for a debate covers twelve measures once considered by former Minister of Immigration , Chris Bowen .	-3.1509
Immigration Secretary Brendan O 'Connor , who visited yesterday on human smuggling in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and others are still being considered .	-3.4700
If the ‘ authority criterion ’ is adopted , someone who applies for a visa could be checked to see whether ‘ the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to or personally connected to the holder or relevant person of the support company ’ .	-18.0360
Companies could also be obliged to provide accountability for the number of 457 visa holders , having finally stopped companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers in the past .	-4.3090

A study has been announced by the British Government to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.4434
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to achieve high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England as early as the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .	-18.6495
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring the UK closer together ” .	-2.3281
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.4106
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-1.4248
After completion of phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-10.1124
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-2.5012
The British Government , which is in discussion with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to look for further track capacity and enhancement of travel time for Northern England and Scotland .	-4.4514
This includes the possibility of travelling to London for three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh .	-3.0748
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings the United Kingdom and its cities closer together . ”	-2.3744
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-1.9556
Without it we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network .	-2.5764
It is also a question of connecting 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which are improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.2024
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-1.8384
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael urged “ unmistakably ” to engage in the HS2 network in Scottish territory .	-14.0617
Brown said , “ The high-speed rail link has the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland , but also provides Scotland ’ s economic power an argument for rapid rail links across the United Kingdom . ”	-4.1689
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-4.8014
I am looking forward to examining the report of the British Ministers next year and jointly adopting the next steps .	-3.5762
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft remain temporarily in force in Australia .	-16.0801
Australian passengers must continue to turn off tablets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax the regulations for such devices .	-3.7431
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their requirements , so that passengers can read , see or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases , see videos or play if they are in “ flight mode ” .	-4.8013
Most of the flights are already allowed to pass , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-4.3258
Australian societies observe the decision to implement which US airlines have to do vast amounts of work , but do not pursue immediate plans to amend their regulations .	-4.3919
The CASA Air Service also declared that the announcement will be considered , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment remain in critical flight stages in Australia .	-5.2981
“ CASA does not currently have specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft ” , has been declared .	-3.9359
The issue is subject to provisions according to which airlines must uphold safety at any time and passengers must follow the safety instructions given by cabin staff .	-3.7578
Virgin has already had talks with the CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and explained that it is open to change , but that these must be initiated by the legislator .	-4.7016
“ We would welcome a review of CASA ’ s licensing of electronic equipment , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.7506
Qantas explained that it will remain with the current rules until further .	-3.3862
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic equipment cannot be used when starting and landing , and we currently have no plans to change it , ” explained the company .	-3.6892
FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.4680
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers , and we will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.8693
The decision differs from the age of the fleet in US companies .	-3.2042
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders by mobile devices , and manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer referral .	-4.1963
“ After an airline confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it was able to passenger passengers to use portable , lighter electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers , and smartphones at all levels ” , the FAA announced .	-4.2643
In rare cases , the crew will tell passengers when landing .	-3.5236
The group also recommended staying heavier devices on startup and landing safely under the seat or in subjects over the seats . , , , , , , , , , , , , . the , , ,	-17.1238
Before the Revierby against Schalke , mid-round BVB supporters with light missiles provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-5.4610
Borussia Dortmund then announced hard consequences .	-1.9902
Before the Friday game of the Football League against the VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras reacted with one silence - first .	-3.6300
It was an unusual acoustic , almost acoustic , offered to the viewer until just before the appeal of the federal liga game between the German vice master Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in Signal Iduna Park .	-5.6973
They were mostly guests with their songs .	-3.5240
The South Tribune , on the other hand , where the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans are faithful , presented themselves with exceptional quietness : no songs , no slaughter .	-5.4273
The podium of the capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint firing , remained unoccupied .	-11.9755
And in front of the gallery a big flag was sweeping with a label called ' Section Stadion Ban ' .	-6.4383
Only when Torchard Roman Weidenfeller first entered the place as the first BVB player did short-term jewels burn .	-6.5355
When his team members followed , there was loud vocals and black shell - but not everywhere .	-5.4903
There was nothing in the central blocks of 12 and 13 in the southern gallery .	-3.1505
Also that stadium speaker Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of recent days - derbysig , victory over Arsenal , extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not care for celebration .	-4.4367
Only five minutes prior to the attack , the Capo clammed his podium - and the tension that was tangible until then escaped in a noisy cry , when the mood wondered on the ranks in the stadium as usual .	-8.2774
As always , the South Tribune was the turn of the gallery - and once again , as usual , it was here the loudest place in the stadium .	-6.6054
And , at the latest , when the southern grandstand , the loud invitation " Derbysieer stands on " came on , everything was again as always .	-7.5876
Previously , silence was a response to what has happened in recent days .	-2.4354
Immediately before Revierby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the middle-class BVB supporters had fired lightweight missiles into the viewers and the place - almost torhüter Roman Weidenfeller hit almost .	-7.4012
The game was late thanks to the chaotic scenes .	-2.3446
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the top of the Ultra Dortmunder in his office - and I think Watzke 's words , this was a rather unsatisfactory date for the fan representatives .	-5.8245
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.7210
As an instant measure , Watzke prohibited the ultras a choreography for his home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-3.7447
" I have banned this " , he explained .	-2.0935
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.9914
Moreover , the Ultras have shown various ways of punishing - until Tuesday , they now have time to opt for one .	-4.5822
Otherwise , according to Watzke , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .	-11.3227
" This becomes increasingly " , insured watzke .	-3.1614
The reactions in the southern gallery must be eagerly awaited .	-3.7987
Pfandhouses are booming in Singapore , as the crisis in the middle class has arrived .	-2.0666
In a Pfandhaus in the Bendeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden strip , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of its daughters .	-12.3717
“ My husband and I bought a house just because my whole money is there ” says Amirthalinga .	-2.5978
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( approximately 1,730 euros ) as a member of the administration and her husband also work , the monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-14.8940
Indeed , the demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is so great that ValueMax , where she has exchanged , was the third house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-4.2167
The jewellery of jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Jani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsafe bank loan .	-4.2411
Typically Pfandhouses in Singapore demand an effective annual rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % that the United Overseas Bank requires , a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-4.5127
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that there is no need to verify credit ratings or income proof , which is why loans can be faster than for banks .	-5.2219
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to Pfandhouses after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-3.8337
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to easier fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and medium-sized incomes are looking for housing to compensate for fatal economies .	-4.8965
This week , the rating agency called Standard & Poor ’ s growing budget debt , mainly through rising mortgages , as a risk factor for the credit ratings of Asian banks .	-3.2339
According to the Agency 's assessment , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to gross domestic produc.	-2.3891
Malaysia , with 80 % of GDP , is at the top of the list , an increase of 60 % in 2008 .	-2.2475
Economists are also concerned about the high levels of consumer debt in Thailand , which has just emerged this week from a technical recession .	-2.5891
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing export weakness and a dismantling of consumer demand .	-3.2201
“ In the end , this means that , given rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to complement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.5832
Historical maximum levels of gold prices in the last two years have reinforced the trend towards the frightening of personal objects , as people use the opportunity to transform the family ’ s jewelry into cash .	-5.8389
In Singapore , approximately 70 percent of the primary objects are in the 200 houses in the city of Gold .	-4.6512
People say , “ The price of gold looks good , let us mortgage grandmother ’ s gold chain and bring back next month . ”	-4.0629
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator , EasyMoney , has seen a 20-percent increase in customer growth in recent months in his branches .	-3.7558

Rebailout package over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare	-2.9939
The Australian government insists on the tough conditions associated with the bailout package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the government of the federal state cannot waste the money .	-3.9941
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases , and system restrictions .	-19.6425
Four years of funding was decided after government meetings with the independent Tasmanian Member Andrew Wilkie .	-3.1837
“ The Government has created an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state ” , Plibersek has today declared .	-4.3852
The $ 325 million package comprises $ 31 million emergency electoral support .	-2.8700
Other 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments for gray star , are intended to remove residues .	-3.5815
In addition , there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better care for stationary stays , specialist medical training , mental health services , and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-4.5566
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected my clinical staff that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” Tanya Plibersek said .	-3.7425
The Minister consisted of a strict accountability of the Tasmanian Government .	-18.6729
The Federal State must retain the current level of financing to receive money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where additional money has been spent .	-3.9309
A three-headed Commission will be established to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.2836
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would benefit little if “ it is not accompanied by real reforms that will bring the public Tasmanian health system to a more sustainable path . ”	-3.9284
Nevertheless , he commended the government for responding to his request for urgent aid , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .	-2.7832
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the Federal State ’ s public health system from the list of concerns , ” said Wilkie .	-3.5756
According to the Federal Government , these electoral services will largely compete with the recent cuts .	-2.5367
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman at the federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ patch solution . ”	-3.3968
“ We are therefore in a position today because the Labor Government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the healthcare system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.3292
It cannot be that a state government is dragging almost half a billion dollars out of the system , and the Commonwealth is hitting 300 million , and then actually as if it were good news .	-6.0534
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not one dollar of the bailout package is spent on extra bureaucracy .	-2.7643

Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition facilities , said Thursday ’ s global surveillance group , while in the north of the country there were serious clashes close to one of the locations where poisonous substances are presumably stored .	-24.6305
A Syrian activist group also announced on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed soon three years ago since the civil war began .	-3.9771
The announcement of the organization for the ban on chemical weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline .	-2.7190
1 November , which had set the Damascus organization based in The Hague , to destroy or “ inoperable ” all the facilities for manufacturing chemical weapons , including all the machines for mixing chemicals to toxic gas and filling ammunition .	-4.4848
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at the destruction of all Syria 's chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.1924
Destroying the facilities means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons .	-2.1516
But Damascus still has to begin to destroy the existing weapons and stocks .	-2.7221
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senfgas and nerve gas sarin .	-3.1538
The announcement came at a time when struggles took place on Thursday in the city of Safira , experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses , as the Syrian observatory on human rights that was based in the UK .	-4.7787
The group of activists who persecute the number of deaths through a network of activists in Syria explained on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-3.6487

This number has not been updated .	-1.0313
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape the country .	-1.7188
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting against the rebels for weeks in Safira , many of which have links to al-Qaida groups .	-2.9632

The struggles highlight the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal of weapons is a race against time in the midst of a top-down civil war .	-3.7173
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , “ the team is now convinced that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and experienced its destruction . ”	-4.4953
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-2.2637
Earlier this week , the inspectors explained that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-2.8186
Because of security concerns , visiting two facilities was not possible , the inspectors said .	-3.5180
On Thursday , OPWC declared that , according to Syrian statement , two sites were “ abandoned ... and the existing objects of the chemical weapons program were relocated to other stated facilities that were inspected . ”	-4.6536
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.4909
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved next month by the OPWC Executive Committee .	-2.6156

Anger at Bali ’ s Bombers	-3.9370
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 in the Bali bombing attack reacted angry at the judgment for the last of the attackers to be brought to trial , as Umar Patek believes should be shot down on a legal basis .	-7.1976
Patek , who was in flee for almost ten years as one of the most willing people of South-East Asia , was condemned yesterday for his role in building explosive bodies for a sentence of 20 years .	-5.2894

A claim was also made in a series of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on sanctuary in 2000 .	-3.8979
The prosecutor had called for lifelong imprisonment , even if for the man who is also called a “ demolition man ” because of his reputation , she could have applied for the death penalty .	-4.8282
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost their 39 years old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago .	-3.4622
She struggled with tears that patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.3693
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-1.9234

Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the other three members of the terrorist cell Yemah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-2.7975
Indeed , this type should be given the death penalty above all .	-3.2246

He escaped almost a decade of arrest , but finally took up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011 , where US forces killed Osama bin Laden almost four months later .	-3.7699
During the negotiation , a FBI agent stated that intelligence reports would have indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between South-East Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.8413
“ He did not make up himself , ” said Corteen .	-3.1086
Until recently , he has shown no repentance of how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-2.7187
The judgment came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is being committed with commemoration ceremonies in Bali and Australia .	-3.8780
“ There will be many tears this year , ” Corteen said .	-2.0683
Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-2.0433
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not conduct mobile calls )	-2.7245
Air travellers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , works , games , music and use the reputation of films , but not with the mobile phone , so the new directives issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-5.6693
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.7620
How quickly they would be implemented by the respective airline , FAA employees Michael Huerta declared at a press conference .	-3.2959
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and have updated the aircraft training manuals and regulations for the confidence of the equipment in accordance with the new regulations . , , and in .	-15.5624
The FAA explained that it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.1225
Among these airlines were Delta and JetBlue .	-1.6768
“ Depending on the condition of the plan , we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic equipment , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-3.3609
Currently , passengers must turn off smartphones , tablets and other devices when aircraft doors are closed .	-2.6701
You may only restart them once the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and gives the captain a green light .	-3.5326
When you arrive at the landing flight passengers must turn off them again and they must not start again before the aircraft has arrived .	-6.4360
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are safe against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use equipment even when starting , landing and rolling field , FAA declared .	-5.1715
Most new transport aircraft and other aircraft converted to a large extent for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.3401
Laura Glading , President of the professional flight manager , welcomed the changes .	-2.6126
“ If the new regulation is securely implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both parties will benefit from it , ” commented glading .	-4.0172
Frankly , we are sorry to have to feel as cautious about this issue . in the . , in , , with .	-13.8289
Nevertheless , Internet connections to surf , exchange of e-mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , explained the authority .	-4.0445
Passengers are required to put smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .	-1.9570
So still no “ Words with Friends , ” the Scrabble similar online game played by the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 at his smartphone when he had to leave American Airlines ’ public-effect jet because he refused to turn off the device while the aircraft was parked .	-31.6619
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be stamped , as there is a risk of injury in the case they fly through the cabin .	-4.8384
Talks on mobile phones during the flight remain banned .	-2.5264
The regulatory competence for telephone calls is with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-3.2921
FAA may lift bans on certain electronic devices on startup and landing .	-12.1047
Last month , Mark Rosenker said by the Transport Safety Authority National Transport Safety Board , security experts on national transport issues on CBS News , mobile phones would still be viewed as risk .	-13.2729
“ Handy are really a problem , not only because they could cause potential disturbances in navigation equipment , but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disturb sendemasters , ” says rosenkers .	-5.3658
A industry advisory committee launched by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government should allow a wider use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.2060
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-13.6285
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri believe that there are no valid safety reasons for banning it .	-3.6401
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become omnipresent .	-3.6967
Some studies talk about this which forgets or ignores up to one third of passengers the disabling of the device .	-4.0760
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment had become known by passenger guided UK radios , which then represented the latest technology trend .	-5.3062
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed and authorised by the FAA to make electronic interferences nothing .	-14.3254
Airlines have been offering Wi-Fi passengers for a few years now , when the in the .	-5.4960
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more unsensitive to interferences .	-2.7955
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.9687
Today ’ s electronic devices generally give much less radiation than previous generations .	-2.4688
For example , e-readers provide only minimal radiation when you shift .	-4.0182
However , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-1.6769
Amazon is one of the advocates of relaxing the restrictions on the use of passengers ' equipment .	-4.1890
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but were unable to identify . flfland with , and , , and . , , and , ,	-14.0590
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.6756
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that disruption by the devices is true , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.6071
Other committee members said that there are only separate reports of pilots who spoke for the disruption of aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .	-3.9850
The Committee , however , recommended the FAA to allow pilots to arrange for passengers when landing instruments in poor conditions of view .	-4.8162
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adaptation for travellers , who would be widely equipped with technology today .	-4.0012
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.5109
Biogel rescued by North Sea Bohrinsel for air rescue service again released by the North Sea Sea B.	-6.3832
A bird floated by air rescue service to the coast , exhausted on a North Sea bear island , was redundant to nature .	-5.3900
The waterralle was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was carried out by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue center in Alloa .	-4.1122
Colin Seddon , head of the center , said : “ This waterrall was probably a winter track from Northern Europe , held by the strong winds across the North Sea . ”	-4.3491
Apparently the exhausted bird was looking for refuge on the drilling island .	-2.7278
He added : “ He could no longer fly over , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.4182

Is Europe ’ s Elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-1.6122
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those in the UK want to change to our relations with the EU .	-16.3244
To this end , we commissioned the biggest and most comprehensive survey among British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-3.1007
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 executives from the economy , representing approximately British corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.1255
The results of the poll will surprise many .	-1.6538
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while states in the EU stagnate .	-3.2834
They want new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil from the government to be favoured , rather than stopping the long and hard process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.4764
In their view , questions about certain legislative issues – from antitrust to product legislation – the majority of business leaders believe that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster .	-5.1344
There was widespread dissatisfaction over the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of Brussels ’ regulations would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of big companies agreed to that traditionally most pro-European .	-5.9594
Finally , and probably most , our survey of business leaders revealed that a substantial majority would wish Britain a course to change the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade not on politics .	-5.0717
This realization , found in corporations of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for “ meaningful change , ” which brings the boost to Britain again .	-5.3934
Much is at stake – an amendment to the agreement and better conditions for the UK would lead to a referendum in opinion at 16 % to a referendum in support of rem.	-5.9155
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this poll shows that the British economy is behind his plan for the renegotiation of British conditions for EU membership .	-3.0225
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations from renegotiation to the United Kingdom .	-14.2277
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary after the eurozone is moving toward a closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.6795
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our poll shows , which means increasing attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations .	-3.7829
Alexei Miller von Gazprom calls Pipeline in Bulgaria the beginning of a new gas era .	-3.1573
The starting point of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects , explained by the Gazprom Board .	-3.7833

The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.6821
South Stream is supposed to ensure greater diversity in Russia ’ s export routes across Europe .	-3.3675
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , in which most of Russia 's gas is stored for Europe , causes increased risk in conventional routes , as the official ones are hearing .	-5.5716
Miller said that the direct connection to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries were “ forever . ”	-2.5340
Bulgarian consumers get South Stream gas at cheap rates when the entire project starts in 2015 .	-3.0913

Consultation to the Royal Commission : Two YMCA officials charged against Jonathan Lord for sexual offences accused two YMCA officials of charges against sexual offences .	-5.4627
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were charged with child sex offences before 2011 allegations were levied against the child carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission learned for the sexual abuse .	-4.8304
But , when the Commission opened its statement , the YMCA stated that ‘ the organization never had an incident of sexual abuse ’ .	-5.0671
Managing Director Phillip Hare was interviewed by a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of abusing child pornography , and another one where a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 was convicted of abuse of children entrusted to him .	-6.3349
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the lawyers assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-2.7079
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “ there were external YMCA checks in which the YMCA was recognised as the forefront of child security . ”	-4.8746
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.2508
Hare , starting with 21 at YMCA , admitted that the management failed ‘ from me to downward ’ to recruit Lord , not ensuring that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the directives on child safety .	-5.4706
Lord was convicted of twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA at the beginning of the year .	-3.5372
He has been sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.5599
Hare disputed , however , that the YMCA had a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lords ’ infringements of children ’ s safety .	-4.2573
The staff said that they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , cared for her private as a baby sitter , let them sit on his lap , said that he loved it , and that children played with his mobile .	-6.1259
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord had asked for training in child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the Child Service Leader Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior Lords at YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most time was very unclose . ”	-5.5136
The Managing Director declared that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report their superior notification .	-4.4649
Instead , he said , her friendship with Lord impacted her judgment , which is why she would not have reported it .	-4.3857
Hare explained that he told the board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson to learn from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” concerns “ not the message ” by employees , and the Board agreed to it .	-4.6299
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations had been made by the managing director of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-3.7785
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence , but that was “ over-hasty ” and badly implemented .	-3.9209
The YMCA NSW was not a safe organization at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , explained Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert for sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-13.1828
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , review , processing , training and supervision of employees .	-3.1757

In an interview this evening , on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his exit from office , the 59 year-old announced his views on various domestic political issues .	-3.5412
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade of Head of State , Blair has largely avoided speaking about British politics , and his comments mostly limited to foreign policy and his role as the envoy of the Quartet of the Middle East peacekeep.	-4.6251
The question of whether he would like to return to Prime Minister 's office was quoted by the Evening Standard from London in the words : ‘ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ’	-3.9998
When the Horse Shaw experts met in Cardiff to cut the horse of the year , they were aware that a tough competition had occurred .	-5.5327
But none was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.0223
The Knirps , which is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago made his first steps , and his Shetland-Pony Toffee worked easily through the three rounds and gained the first prize – with 30 adult opponents left behind .	-5.7584
The indivisible couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition held by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry , Cardin Rud.	-5.2465
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had set up his leghold caps in a narrow angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-5.6132
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural capabilities in dealing with the pony that goes far beyond his age .	-3.8325
And Toffee received best notes for his appearance and personality .	-2.2351
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and since every day exercised with the Shetland Pony .	-2.7968
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great excitement . ”	-1.9635
They had to compete against the entire field of participants and have gone out of place with gold pocal and rosette .	-5.4506
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with toffee , and we were all delighted when he won .	-11.3372
Fully strangers in the Arena kept him phenomenally to be photographed with him .	-4.2381
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his Tante Sharon Howells , which has been horses for over ten years .	-3.3079
Howells told : “ All the audience was like electric , and everyone fired and clapped it . ”	-4.7824
He ran on sand the entire length of the Arena and although he looked so tiny , he did a fantastic job .	-3.7461
Fenton is mad after animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of .	-2.9876
It will not take a long time for it to be on the horse of the year – and I am sure it will be done well .	-4.2087
One speaker from the annual Horse Chair said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.5913
Together they are a great team .	-1.0518
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had fallen and presented in the lead .	-13.1480
They focus on good cooperation between Pony and Leader – and here Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-3.8490
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has contributed its part to making a perfect match .	-4.4557
Chinese newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after call .	-2.5294
A Chinese newspaper , which had requested the release of a reporter on the front page , charged with defamation , was to be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-4.2228
Neue Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Che Yongzhou .	-2.6027
But Chen later admitted on television that he accepted bribes to forge reports of a partial . the was . , , , , , , , , the , . the ,	-14.3307
Now the New Express is subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the Regulatory Authority expla.	-3.2557
The “ Rectification Order ” came from the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdon.	-3.0704
Preliminary investigations revealed that the Neue Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several inaccurate reports on the Zoomlion listed company between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-4.1610
“ New Express editorial management was disordered , ” the Regulatory Authority announced in a declaration .	-3.4389
She said that it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license . ”	-3.2817
Moreover , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to make a full rectification of the New Express and recommend that the relevant responsible be determined at the New Express and review the leadership team immediately . ”	-5.8846
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines named Zoomlion .	-2.3694
After he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and behind his journalistic work .	-2.6648
But then Chen went on state television , admitting that he published false reports against payment .	-3.0632
“ In this case , I damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he declared to the state news agency CCTV .	-4.7275
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-1.6199
I realise that I have done the wrong thing .	-2.2858
Following Chen ’ s apology , the Neue Express published an apology on the front page and explained that it was not possible to properly review the reports .	-4.7633
Various well-known suspects have recently made television confessions .	-2.4376
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced , despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year in which the authorities were banned to force someone to accuse themselves .	-3.4631
Drug Tunnel discovered by its own railways between the US and Mexico	-2.7677
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was completely equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electric rail operation , has now been discovered .	-3.2718
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever had found .	-2.6619
The tunnel , which runs in the zickzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.2723
There are countless unseen storage halls in the area , making it easier to hide loaded trucks with drugs .	-3.8797
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized , the authorities declared .	-2.3006
During the discovery of the tunnel , eighteen and a half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were assured , the records of the court .	-3.5247
Three men who worked as a driver according to the authorities were charged with the ownership and intended sale of Marihuana and Cocain .	-3.4823
They are threatened with a debt sentence between ten years and lifelong .	-2.8390
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels .	-2.3830
The tunnel is the eighth big passage discovered since 2006 in San Diego .	-1.8056
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which puts drug cartels before the challenge of bringing their product to the consumers quickly .	-4.2224
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 metres long passage with railways , which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-3.4470

Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about separating his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr . , in , , by , . , , , he the the , and , the . , , the the	-15.7255
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which was to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or hope . "	-11.6111
Kerr and he still loved himself , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-1.9413
" We will support each other and love to be Flynn parents .	-2.8390
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , their son Flynn was born in 2011 .	-2.4681
Veganism , according to Lexico , is a vegetarianism , but it differs significantly from that .	-4.0683
For while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream tours , ice or a powerful Edamer , these sluts are not on the vegan 's menu .	-5.7600
Milk , cheese , eggs , besides the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegan derives from all consumption of animal products - honey is also denied .	-4.1580
What remains , you may wonder , but the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable resource of ideas . in .	-15.9891
" Brotate strokes are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform House , who has a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.6771
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the store in the Domgasse .	-3.4560
For the past 13 years , the native New Zealand vegan has been living in Lampertheim , finding ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 , I was a vegetarian .	-6.0892
The next step was taken around the turn of the century and I was Vegan .	-2.5311
" The conviction came not only because of the diet but because of the shoe choice " , says Proctor , who prefers art leather normal leather .	-3.8330
He recognized that there is no animal products in other everyday situations .	-4.6357
First and foremost , vegan is an ethic .	-9.7861
" I don 't want animals to die for me " , Proctor speaks out the maxim of the vegans that extends to all consumer behaviour .	-4.0500
Instead of trying to rubber , smoke or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered new products , the enthusiasm has risen .	-6.2476
" It 's a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " actually does not constitute a waiver , not an asque , but an enrichment " .	-5.4782
And that is precisely the conditioning that has caused some attempts to fail .	-4.5105
" The addiction factor is a crucial factor that lets many abandon quickly , similar to that of smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-3.9687
And uses one : " Certain tastes are not to detect at the animal " .	-5.4297
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste . , , , , in .	-11.1362
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " the vegan clarifies .	-3.6754
Proctor brings you to a barbecue , for example Aubergine , Champignon and also a few vegan dishs .	-5.2873
It pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , where it is supposed to taste it frequ.	-4.8924
Of course , one wants to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.0383
" It should taste , but this is not only to reduce animal food , " says Proctor .	-3.1349
He did not suffer health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-1.9518
For me , the change had a positive aspect .	-1.9333
I do not take a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share .	-3.2311
There are high-performance athletes that only feed vegan .	-2.2674
" My blood values are good , I leave myself checking , " treasure Proctor .	-3.4046
Especially before the lack of vitamin B12 , many vegansimus critics warn .	-2.4917
" Since animals are nourished with feed instead of grazing on pasture , it is questionable whether the meat that you buy in the refrigerator is high vitamin B12 share , " Proctor finds .	-5.5097
For Veganer it also gives the opportunity to take the coenzym in the form of tablets .	-13.2846
" My B12 values are in order , " he explains .	-1.7317
Large paths do not need to be Proctor for food procurement .	-4.0797
Basic foodstuffs are available everywhere and each supermarket now has soyamilch and other products .	-3.9092
I think everything I need on the ground .	-10.3540
I only bought something special .	-2.8073
" Many people overlook that only finished products are expensive , but this is how they are known for " ordinary " finished products .	-4.1885
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is much more favourable and less time-consuming than is commonly accepted .	-3.9796
" In the house kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small knives you can get good if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-4.3789
Margarine instead of butter , a little more backpowder and carbon acid instead of Ei , with his vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring his silent parents to the woods .	-5.3017
The Vegan family festival gives a new source .	-3.9031
Dynamism , when you cook together , has a new role to play .	-3.8405
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves " says Proctor .	-2.6766
He was , of course , already skepticised .	-2.5503
Do you taste my food no longer ?	-2.4627
" Should I now feel bad because I drink milk ? " - if such questions you have to act as a vegan with a sense of finger .	-4.8038
" I don 't reject the people , I am part of this society " , Proctor does not want an enclave deadline .	-4.1221
And , more precisely , the world of everyday life does not appear as strange as suspected - and the vegan does not appear as restricted as usual .	-5.0979
Also Fast Food is allowed .	-2.1992
Pomme is there everywhere !	-1.1961
" Many doors offer Falafel , or a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-2.7363
In a pizzeria he deviates from pastage reports , or orders a pizza without cheese , everything a question of habit .	-3.7884
Restaurants are getting ready for this .	-3.6549
" When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult " , the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to the people , make them attentive to it " .	-4.9651
" If there are enough demands , they may be inclined to complement the menu , " he hopes .	-2.9136
Vegane restaurants are developing , such as the Mannheim combinations or the Café Vogelfree .	-3.4945
Proctor wants other restaurants to have a vegan meal on the menu .	-2.7384
Basically , vegan dishes are available for everyone .	-2.4962
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-1.4789
" Meat courts are exclusive , in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor states .	-12.7544
" If we want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority of them impossible from the outset " , says Proctor .	-3.1550
But purchasing vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-2.8361
Especially if you learn to understand that animal additives can also be a color supplier in earth nuts , you seem to have the courage to leave ethics with so many hurdles and traps quickly .	-14.8622
Not only have the vines Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal Contents and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are supplied by food and cleaning products . in , and , in the . in the of and in , , in . the of and the , in , the	-20.9400
" After and after you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to attend " It 's sometimes better to do small steps than stumble or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-4.4924
Veganism , it is an important moral sign that attacks awareness .	-3.3376
Perhaps he does not entirely manage to take his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question his habits critically .	-4.5522
The Nasdaq OMX stock exchange operator keeps its customers in breath .	-2.2530

British police forces Assange a shipment note .	-2.9189
Today , the British police have given a dispatch to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who has sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-3.6573
Scotland Yard explained that Australia ’ s 40th anniversary was sent a “ invitation to stand up ” that asked him to appear in a police guard , and added that he would not comply with it , threatening him to arrest .	-6.3501
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence , after exhausting its possibilities under British law , since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition early this month .	-4.2587
As he feared that Stockholm would extradite him to the US , he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked South America ’ s country for political asylum .	-3.2649
Scotland Yard , “ a 40-year-old man , sent an invitation to attend a police guard at a time we were elected , ” said a speaker .	-4.9470
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .	-2.0875
The message did not give any comments on the request for police .	-3.3202

Tax on foreign real estate owners against London ’ s speculative bubble	-1.7126
The Treasury has calculated the CGT measure on a provisional basis , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a stamp tax on apartments in the 2012 budget , which cost more than two million pounds and annual charges for buyers who consider apartments as a company and not as individuals .	-5.9511
Already , revenues from the stamp tax for residential property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which were at 708 million pounds in the tax year 2012 / 13 , the revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North-East , North-West , Yorkshire and the Humber region , are already exceeding re.	-5.8122
Cook said : “ After the raises in the stamp tax on high-priced housing and the introduction of associated legislation against handling it , it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the impact of the obsolete community tax system . ”	-6.3663
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more likely in terms of purchasing real estate in London , or discourage owners from selling it , ” he added .	-3.3541
First class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy London South-West Bürtel , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , has taxed around the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-5.1237
The prices in Central London were equivalent to 5.6 % annual growth , but were overshadowed by an emerging domestic market , where the south-west part of the city , the North ( 7.4 % ) and the East ( 6.5 % ) experienced a upward trend , such as an investigation of Saville .	-4.4454
Scientists could take more light on the relationship between a dog 's tail and mood .	-4.7563
Previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail were swept to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left at nervous dogs .	-4.8732
But scientists now say that other dogs can see these subtle differences and respond to them .	-2.8153
Professor Georgio Vallorgigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ Man is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that produces positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.6041
We have tried to look at this in other species .	-2.6050
He also noted that the right brain half of the left movement , as in humans , is responsible for the movement of the left , and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-4.8429
In order to learn more about how dogs respond to the side tail of their species , researchers monitor the animals while these films looked at other dogs .	-4.6494
They measure the heart rate of the four-legged and analysed the behavior .	-2.4829
We probably will soon understand why the cock is moving in the other direction .	-3.7744
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown dogs with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and thus we have managed the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-4.5066
When the animals saw an otherwise impressive dog moving the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the moving dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.1543
But the tail was mainly left ( from the perspective of the dog who turned away ) , so their heart frequency rose and they looked uncalm .	-5.2398
Professor Vallortigara believes that the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-2.4277
Instead , it is convinced that dogs have learned from experience what movements they should be concerned and when not .	-4.0227
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and if you are linked with the tail in a direction more friendly behavior , and the right side is more of a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.3713
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to understand the emotions of their animal .	-2.9999
John Bradshaw , expert for dog behavior and guest stipendiate at the Faculty of Animal Healing at the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study to examine whether left and right is important for dogs .	-4.5468
Last year , a team at the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they see an aggressive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .	-3.7621
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when being tail ‘ left and not right , rather than becoming troubled – precisely other than in the Italian study . ”	-7.0220
According to his statement , the differences could thus stem from the fact that the dogs in various studies did not interpret animals in films or robot dogs as dogs .	-4.1875
A study how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.0863
“ There is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for various purposes , but many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” said Bradshaw .	-3.3371
But since their behaviour is simply recorded , it will probably not take a long time to understand why the tail sometimes moves in the other direction .	-4.3908
Arctic Monkey 's appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners was postponing .	-12.8592
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys has postponed a appearance in Glasgow after their lead singer is ill-head inflam.	-3.9013

Pope Francis appoints February ’ s first cardinal dials in February .	-3.7066
On February 22 , Pope Francis will first invoke new Cardinals of the Catholic Church , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.4905
Cardinals are the highest ranking clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the ones who choose a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.4595
Currently there are 201 cardings .	-2.2011
However , a cardinal reaching an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope election – one group of 120 “ voting cardinalists ” .	-4.9941
In a statement in which the message was announced , Federico Lombardi , a speaker from the Vatican , said that there will be a meeting of all cardinants before the ceremony will be held for the appointment of the new cardinants , which is also known as the consistency .	-5.8586
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the consistency in February in advance so that other meetings that require cardinal participation can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-4.2292
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardings eligible for elections will probably fall by February .	-4.5475
He explained that a Pope normally appoint as many cardinal cardinants as necessary to return to 120 , and so many cardings above 80 as he wants .	-6.0630
The consistency of next year is important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year , says Valero .	-2.7827
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and in particular Italy .	-2.2161
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinal from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-2.2296
Fourty percent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinalists .	-2.9212
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called the Cardinals Council , established since the formation of the Francis Council , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church .	-6.0553
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.9022
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinances to help him , ” said Valero .	-3.0683
He explained that it was “ good ” that Francis would ask for advice .	-4.0241
But we have not been able to do this until now – that is all very new .	-3.6679
Valero said that the bishops would typically be called to cardinals from large places , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints . ”	-4.7491
GM calls for new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seat lean .	-2.6609
General Motors call almost 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra-Pickup trucks with construction year 2014 to address a problem with manually adjustable seat rears , such as a communication from the US Regulator for Vehicle Safety on Friday .	-4.8796
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism of withdrawing the front seat belt .	-3.2238
For this reason , they do not comply with the German vehicle safety guidelines on head restraints .	-3.2273
“ When driven from behind the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the insults so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” the news was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration website ( NHTSA ) .	-4.4117

Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what might have been possible .	-2.0231
Nathaniel P. Morris is a second year student at Harvard Medical School .	-1.6646
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .	-1.3960
It is a book of which I believed it would listen to my medical study during the fragile second year and give me hope again .	-4.8270
It is called “ The Audacity to Win , ” and describes the Memoir Barack Obamas as as presidential election in 2008 .	-3.3045

In the years since I voted for the first time , something has changed .	-2.1736
But it is simply not something I could have imagined .	-2.1348
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army , and the killing of Osama bin Ladens .	-13.4759
I also believe that the party political blockadetics have tilted too many efforts to move our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay to name just a few .	-4.6715
But after I have defended the Obama administration countless to colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my explanation attempts .	-4.4436
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.2697
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows foreign leaders to listen or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-3.0097
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ private lives , and why whistleblowers are punished that disclose government misbehavior .	-3.9626
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without procedure , nor why public financing and spending ceilings will be circumvented during the presidential election .	-3.1349
It does not justify the results of a report that says that the White House ’ s efforts to bring the media calm down are the most “ aggressive ... since the Nixon administration . ”	-4.2514

The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether or not to cut CO2 and mining taxes .	-3.1775
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.3844
“ He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant he has a direct interest in whether or not to spend a holiday , ” Palmer said .	-3.9762

RBS suspends two foreign exchange dealers	-0.9464
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from their foreign-exchange department , so two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global authorities are quickly taking on the presumed manipulation of the currency market .	-5.0914
Some of the world ’ s biggest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and RBS , confirmed that they cooperated with the authorities in investigations in the world ’ s largest financial market , where US $ 5.3 trillion changes the owner every day .	-4.0563
The two traders would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation that the Libor interbanking scandal causes .	-4.2889
The Bank , which did not comment on suspension , confirmed this month that they received information requests from authorities .	-3.3633
“ Our investigations on this issue are continuing and we are fully cooperating with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-15.3735
Last month , the situation admitted that the RBS forwarded records of emails and instant messages sent by and to a previous dealer to the British supervisory authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-3.8004
This dealer , Richard Usher , had left the RBS 2010 and is now to have been judged by his current position as the European head of Forex Spot Trade at JPMorgan .	-15.9752

UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss Regulatory Authority , Finma , declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign-exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-4.6778
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Agency Weko , the FCA , the US Ministry of Justice , and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently engaged in charges of bankers dealing with transactions to the currency market .	-4.1217
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said familiar people with the situation .	-3.4188
Banks break through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-2.5685
The news of these investigations has turned traders into an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year was under pressure because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .	-4.5089
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extensive and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.5464
A leading retailer noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to the “ influence of the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-4.9525
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she announced a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office this week , after losing almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-3.8393

Egypt ’ s First Free-elected presidents	-15.9289
Mohammed Morsi denies the official , but his triumph day is unlikely to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt .	-4.8673
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was first freely elected president of the country , forcing the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been forced out of office 16 months earlier .	-3.4929
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-3.1775
He suspended the oath to the 18 judges dressed in black robes , who are seated in the Nile and felt after an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.3310
“ We are seeking a better future , a new Egypt , and a second republic , ” said Morsi in the solemn ceremony that was transmitted live on state television .	-3.0951
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy , and stability , ” said Morsi , a Muslim Brotherhood trained in the US , a fundamentalist group that , since its foundation 84 years ago , had usually been targeted by the government in question as a prohibited organization .	-5.4676
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen supervised the building when Morsi joined a small autoconvoi shortly after eleven hours of local time .	-3.8978
Only a few hundred trailers had gathered in front of the court to accommodate the new president , and , unlike the presidial president of the Mubarak era , traffic was stopped shortly so that the autoconvoi could cross the usually lively road that links the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-5.6888
As an uncharismatic “ spare wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , presenting himself not only as a candidate of the Islamists , but of all those who wanted to bring the 2011 uprising against the authoritarian Mubarak to the target .	-6.6671
“ Egypt is today a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” says Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , decorated to judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he laid the office .	-6.2349
Later Morsi went to the University of Cairo , where he was supposed to keep his inaugural speech .	-2.7387

The military leader Feldmarshal Hussein Tantawi was present .	-1.0829
On his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of presidents in the largest hearing hall in the University with speeches by “ The Army and the people are one hand ” .	-5.7684

Torrent in South Africa : twice lifelong imprisonment	-2.2087
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator has been sentenced twice on Friday .	-2.2715
This was reported by the Sender SABC .	-1.1172
The victim later died as a result of serious injuries .	-2.1208
Johannes Kana had already been found guilty of crime at the beginning of the week .	-2.6799
The fact was horrifying nationally .	-3.6716
The 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February in an industrial area in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .	-2.9579
14 hours were fighting for the survival of the victim , but in vain .	-2.0965
The insight of young people was so appalling that the carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .	-2.3677
Cana had admitted during the process to have been in a bar in fact with boys .	-2.3150
He also felt that he was beaten and raped but he disputes being responsible for the death of the girl .	-11.2097
The police first assumed several perpetrators , but laid off two suspects because the evidence against them was insufficient .	-3.6033
The Prosecutor also stressed during the process that she was convinced that Cana was alone at the time of the attack .	-2.6316
Rapes are already almost everyday in South Africa : there are about 64 000 ads per year because of sexual violence .	-14.4038

You thought that travel agencies are part of the past thanks to Internet ?	-2.0395
Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend .	-1.1860
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record revenues from tourists in Australia and the United Kingdom .	-4.1617
The travel company now expects a revised annual profit from $ 325 to $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its previous forecast .	-4.3635
If the current targets are achieved , this will mean growth of 12 to 17 % compared with the record profit of $ 290.4 million in the period 2011 / 12 .	-3.9292
As Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent in the first half of the year , boosting a strong start to the second half of the year , particularly in Australia and Britain ’ s private business .	-3.8926
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries are profitable , and some of them are on a good path towards record revenue before interest and taxes , ” he explained .	-4.2302
This includes Australia and the United Kingdom , which typically belong to our most powerful earnings .	-3.9106
In Australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , offering a slightly weaker market for business trips .	-12.5596
Similarly , it was good for the leisure activities of Flight Centre in the United Kingdom , while business clients spent less .	-4.6179
The US business recovered from the seasonally weaker first six months , expecting a profit for the third year as a result .	-3.8934

Other nuclear subjects will be changed next year .	-1.4778
In a separate initiative , Ofqual , the supervisory authority for audits , will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures , including a new bandwidth system and less course work .	-4.1315
In a summer speech , Michael Gove , education minister , said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasizing that the GCSEs will become “ challenging , more ambitious and stricter . ”	-4.2635
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .	-2.9284
On the other hand , Australian schools learn on average 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-2.7942
While there will be no formal requirement to allow more time for mathematics in the hour plan , coalition cycles will mean that comprehensive math examination – combined with a greater emphasis on professional ranking – will probably encourage schools to start more hours .	-5.5991
The curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life , ” including financial mathematics .	-12.2670

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Conversation Forum	-1.7169
The next Ecumenical Conversation Forum on Monday , 21 October , at the New Museum of the Schloss , we are talking about the theme of " Zur Hölle mit Hölle - Theological Considerations on how to deal with the last things " .	-5.8403
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-9.4027
The Ecumenical Conversation Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant parish Salem , the Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of the Lake Constance .	-3.4604
Johanna Rahner wants to examine in the forum how people are now classifying the ' last things ' after death .	-3.9171
Had people knew too much of this over the past centuries , placing on the images of heaven and hell , " which still characterise our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic lesson of the hopes for completion is more disturbing , or even speechlessness .	-7.1162
" The greater hope has been exorcised by Christians by criticism of religion " says the referenti. , by , , , in , . , , , with , , ,	-13.7724
" She provided us with so many questionnaires that we seem to have lost the exclamation marks " .	-4.7710

In fantastic weather , 214 cyclists came to Lake Illmensee to handle the round course across the hills around the lake .	-4.0338
This includes Ulrich Knobel of the event Sportsverein IllLmen.	-4.4136
Participants were among them , especially at the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres above sea level , as well as numerous wheelers who wanted to exercise their hobby in a competitive atmosphere .	-5.6198
Two junior drivers from the German top class were also at the start of this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places for the German Championships .	-4.2955

On two and three Anne Adel from Lake Illmensee and Leonie drivers came from Owingen .	-2.5779
A pleasing development is the growing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-3.0247
The entire range of sportsmen was represented not only in terms of power but also in terms of .	-4.7367
Also the age structure ran from ten years from the youngest to over 70 years at the oldest starters .	-4.2936

Four drivers were able to choose from the top regional drivers .	-2.9108
Among them Philipp Pangrl , a mountain bike semi-professional of the Black-Tusk-Racing team .	-4.0457
Pangrl , along with a team colleague , was already World Champion in the Twelve Hour Ride .	-4.6596
This year he became a European champion in this special discipline .	-1.8907

For 21 years , Georges Bwell saw how his sick father constantly lost awareness and traveled to hospitals who did not have the means to help him .	-3.1674
In 1981 , Jamef Bwelle was injured in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon . in , in , in , , in . , the , ,	-12.3300
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation expanded on his brain and caused a hematom there to affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.0832
“ There were no neurosurgeries in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwell .	-2.4799
We would have brought it out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-1.7928
Instead , Bave spent years accompanied his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.1760
“ It ’ s not easy , ” commented Bwell .	-2.4260
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and it is not the first .	-3.7805
There are many patients .	-1.3537
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.4938
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell ’ s father died in 2002 .	-1.6980
Cameroon has only one doctor for 5,000 people , that is the World Health Organization .	-2.9668
Conversely , the relationship is with a doctor for 413 people in the United States .	-3.2580
But even if there was a doctor for them , most cameruners could not afford to visit it .	-3.0539
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three quarters of domestic health expenditure are private . by the , in the the . , , , , in , , in the the	-16.8944
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwell .	-2.4458
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.7481
His father , and so many of his compatriots , suffered in Bwell the decision to do something about it .	-2.9297
Dr. Georges Bwell and his voluntary team performed 700 free operations last year .	-2.6973
He was himself a doctor and worked as a vessel in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-2.5953
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas during weekends and offers free medical services .	-3.5181
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer have helped just under 32,000 people .	-1.9758
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people drive in buses and drive on the rooftop via unattached terrain to the villages which need help .	-15.6500
It is not always smooth .	-1.9074
Even more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.0407
But when they arrive they will receive like heroes : a celebration , vocal and dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.0996
In these villages , free medical care really is a reason for celebration and threshold – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – is happy to join the celebration of joy.	-5.5148
The next morning the team will begin investigating hundreds of patients .	-2.4035
“ Pro journey we treat 500 people ” , says Bwelle .	-13.2012
They come from a village of 60 kilometres around the village – walking distance .	-3.7275
Each weekend clinic offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.1267
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmittable diseases .	-1.7038
Others receive cruises , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document required for school , but simply cannot afford many poor families .	-3.1821
In the evening the team performs simple operations with local anesthesia .	-1.8866
The operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after intervention , the patients are on and walk into the recreational area to make space for the neighbour .	-5.4882
Lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is fed by the generator of the group , thus work Bwell and its volunteers until early hours on Sunday .	-4.6162
It is an enduring pension , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-3.0212
" You are drumming all night so we can keep wake up and continue our work , " says Bwell .	-14.0371
On Sunday the team then returns to the city , tired but proud of the work that has been done .	-3.4965
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with their work , it makes a huge difference to the people it helps .	-5.2906
One man explained that the free operation of a service break that he received now enables him to rework .	-3.7585
“ This changes the future of my family , ” said the man .	-2.2896
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as surgery in hospital , Bwell works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.2056
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , according to barbeque ; the rest come from private donations .	-3.5307
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and voluntarily participates in Bwelles Group .	-3.3078
He is always in hospital or seeks to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-3.9910
For medical and health care students such as O 'Malley , who come from the USA and Europe , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-3.4270
" We can be involved in operations where we help to drain blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwell " , explains O 'Malley .	-4.8235
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.4007
Students usually pay their trips to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitary material .	-3.3540
But once in Yaoundé , Bwell assumes accommodation , transport and instructions .	-3.6647
“ He is certainly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.3425
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits .	-3.2774
For Bwell , almost constant work is no burden .	-3.7385
Helping others to a happier life , thereby fulfilling a promise that he gave his father , is delighted to him .	-13.5589
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwell .	-2.7977
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.0477

Excellent the Fight Makes	-11.1719
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to the body by Horst Janson .	-3.0206
Janson is himself an old hare in his meter , the art of actress .	-3.4576
No one can foot the old man Santiago while fishing .	-2.6592
Thus the two simply complement themselves great .	-3.0263
One almost argues that the wrinkles of the old man , of which the fishing young Manolo speaks , can be seen .	-4.5752
When Santiago is sitting in the chair tired of life , that is true of Janson .	-4.1264
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a characteristic role that Janson manages excellent .	-4.5992
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not abandon and ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and his will .	-14.0381
Janson is on stage in wide distances as alone representative .	-3.9775
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself , so his monologists are not boring for a moment .	-3.4597
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists only of blue lit water bottles .	-4.3922
director Jens Hasselmann leaves the old man on boat to the fishing village .	-2.6167
During the performance he launches the active scene : Santiago 's hut , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her wonderful voice , makes Cuba 's sense of life .	-5.2472
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.6038
Tourism : Departure to Romans !	-14.2611
Behind Cologne a sewage channel is preserved at about 120 metres long .	-4.9872

Around 157 meters , the two towers push it into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe . from , in . the , the , , the , the , .	-13.2756
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigrant churches suggest there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-4.2608
Rainer Schulze is an expert on Cologne 's underworld .	-2.1286
The meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne-Tourism on the Duomo .	-3.8870
The tour starts inspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-3.3227
In the 1970s , the fathers of the city wanted to have an autographic city , which is why the remains of the old wall were only what was not too large .	-5.8591
Most users of the park house therefore rush through the Roman remnants today and only deposit their car .	-5.8510
Whoever looks more closely , the D2 parkdeck discovers an archaeological size separated by metal gitters .	-5.5894
You can see about five metres of high ruins made of handler-large stones .	-5.4715
" The remains of the Roman city walls , built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " tells school .	-14.5214
Before going back to the daylight , school leaves the participants at the upper parking plain a glimpse into a darker , 15 metres deep shaft .	-5.4613
This is the well of the old dome , which unfortunately is hardly perceived .	-2.8782
Nearby station of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants get down to the depth .	-4.2818
We are here to see the presidency of the once the most powerful man north of the Alps , the CCAA Predor .	-4.4813
What CCAA means is a visitor to know .	-1.7207
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in German as much as " city of Roman law and city of the Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the Altar for the Kaiser Kult " .	-5.0024
And the pretorium is the former palace of State , the Roman empire on the Rhine .	-4.5941
From the front of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman slopes channel , which is preserved at about 120 metres long .	-4.5275
" You can quietly pass a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want , " suggests school the guests .	-4.4351
A surprise still has school .	-1.5353
After having taken the key on the cashier , he leads the group to a 16m deep , crafted shift .	-6.0154
" We are now in the mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.7343
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground to get to the groundwater , which was indispensable for ritual washing .	-3.4057
Until today , in the lower end of the Mikwe , the origins of which go back to the eighth century , different waterfronts can be read through alternating levels of the Rhine .	-5.7729
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone in the Town Hall Square for which the construction works will soon begin .	-3.6697
But there will be a few years before we complete it .	-4.3924

A bloody attack in the rocker milieu will be rerouted after more than four years .	-3.1668
A process due to attempts to slag , dangerous bodily injury , and damage to facts against two 30 years has begun before the district court of Frankfurt ( Or ) .	-7.0906
It is accompanied by strict security arrangements .	-1.6142
