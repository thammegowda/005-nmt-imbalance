The question about the referendum was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Gre  ? '	-2.9896

Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will urgently need investment in Macedonia , a country with more than 20 % unemployment .	-2.2318

But the hard-combated Scherzer hopes to be able to climb the hills on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for the rockies that have a lead of a game before Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-4.6132
The rockies were secured with a 5 : 2 victory over the nationals on Friday evening at least one place , but the title profit in the first league is still not sure .	-4.3875
" Even if we are playing for anything else , we can at least witness because we know that the atmosphere in Denver will probably be the best of us this year to offer .	-7.4516

Unfortunately , it is not the sound of many meetings today , and the promise of a " friendly , more gentle " politics is long forgotten when it ever started .	-4.8161
It has become clearer that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is assessed whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-3.2198
This began briefly to Jeremy ’ s office , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought that I had a similar political attitude expected that I would carry out a turnover and take positions with which I otherwise had never agreed , whether with regard to national security or the EU internal market .	-5.0783

Robyn Christian of Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have used their opportunities better . ”	-2.0077
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt in the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , which was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and to speak Jason Baggot an untransformed attempt .	-5.0810
Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a penalty before he reached a match directly at half-time and then made a solo trial with which he came to the 17 : 5 breakfast for Ayr .	-5.0365
Melrose began the second half-time well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed by Baggot , reduced the backward to five points .	-2.7440
There was a longer interruption because of the serious violation of Ruaridh Knott , who left the playing field on a week .	-4.7721

The examination results of this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest rates of existence in independent schools .                	-3.1726
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have achieved the so-called “ Higher grade A ” higher class A .	-2.8217
The data collected by the SCIS 74 member schools showed that 72 percent of students reached a “ higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while among the students who learned German , French and Spanish , reached 72 , 69 and 63 the Note A .	-3.6745
This shows that independent schools in Scotland promote foreign languages as essential skills that will undoubtedly need children and young people in the future .	-2.4553
Speakers have the same rank as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) in the curriculums of independent schools and elsewhere .	-3.0258
A British Commission survey for employment and qualifications from 2014 showed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulties to occupy free jobs are a lack of language knowledge .	-3.4670
Therefore , language knowledge is becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-2.4471
Given language employment opportunities , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-2.9435
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he learned a second language , he has a real advantage in future with a lifelong ability like this .	-2.8687
By communicating directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of competitors .	-2.5489
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a discussion , and French is the only language spoken with a double-digit percentage , 15 % .	-3.9814
That is why the current investment in language teaching for today 's children is important .	-2.6299
When children learn to speak several languages – particularly those of developing countries – they have better opportunities to find useful employment in the labour market later .	-2.9717
Scotland ’ s schools are different from language offerings .	-2.8737
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages will be informed , most important for Britain in terms of 2020 , such as mandarin or Japanese .	-3.4366
Whatever your child interests , it will always be a series of languages in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this area .	-2.5683
Independent schools in Scotland want to offer a learning environment that prepares children well , they should receive the necessary armor for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-3.6461
In the global business world of the present languages , languages remain important for the country ’ s future , and that must also be reflected in education .	-3.0253
Indeed , modern languages should be really considered “ international communication capabilities . ”	-2.1016
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this selection , diversity and top quality .	-2.2558

President Donald Trump starts this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.1055
It is the first of five planned electoral events next week , and on his tour Trump also visits the Republican-friendly states Tennessee and Mississippi .	-3.3545
While the confirmation of his candidate for the vacant position of the Supreme Court is still outside , Trump must mobilise his electorate for the forthcoming interim elections , as otherwise the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-4.3922
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally this evening and how can it be looked online ?	-2.4690
Trump 's Rallye in Wheeling , West Virginia , is planned for 19 a.m. ET t ni     , Sa   , S  29     , 2018 .	-2.5586
You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online by live stream on YouTube .	-2.1511
Trump will certainly respond to the hearings taking place this week concerning the allegations for sexual abuse against his candidates for the post of the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office that has to take place by the Senate has been postponed by at least a week 's conclusion of the FBI investigations .	-4.6792
The main objective of these electoral events is to mobilise the Republicans who face a crucial election in November .	-2.5767
According to Reuters , Trump ’ s campaign ’ s aim is to mobilise volunteers and supporters with the five electoral events next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and Representatives .	-3.8822
“ The majority in Congress is first at the President ’ s agenda , and that is why he visited as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent electoral campaign season , ” a spokesperson of the Trump campaign who did not wish to be called , Reuters .	-4.7184
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radion network , the electoral event taking place in the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and draw the attention of the Pittsburgher Media .	-3.8678
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points , will visit for the second time this month .	-2.6374

Ryder Cup 2018 : The team USA is ready for the fight to maintain hope for Sundays singles	-5.5448
After three unilateral encounters , the four games were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.7196
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that the players have reminded , especially in competitions like this .	-3.2486
So where would they say the momentum now ?	-1.8762
“ You have had a six-point leader and now there are four , so we have a little momentum , ” said Jordan Spieth , when he withdrew himself for the day . ”	-3.8182
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of 4 points , and twelve others still have to be played .	-3.1946
The Americans , as Spieth says , however , feel something in their sails and there were much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have played the whole day together and have thr of four points .	-3.8782
Spieth was considered from the outset and was progressing with a good example .	-3.2253
These castle cries were louder when his round continued to reduce a decisive putt to achieve a decision in play 4 after he and Thomas returned 2 points after 2 points .	-4.8308
His joy about the putt on 15 holes with which they won the game was thought that he still believed in the victory of Americans .	-3.3889
" You really have to concentrate strongly and you only have concerns about your own game " , said Spieth .	-3.4306
That is also what each of these players now remain .	-3.8414
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.9946
In this Ryder Cup , in the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.9489
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple plays error and simply makes everything right .	-2.8730
" Moliwood " was the only couple that did not achieve a Bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they avoided them behind nine on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning  .	-3.5757
This course and the way in which its energy appears to be flown and from this viewer amount of spectators makes it to the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who seals a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-5.0816
Probably both simultaneously on various holes .	-4.2991
Speaking of a European victory now would be too premature .	-2.2696
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who was winning with his partner Alex Noren on the morning .	-2.3726
With one bogey and two doubles on the first nine , the Spaniard and the Swede are integrating into a hole from which they never rec .	-4.8351
On Sunday , there is no one who helps you from your hole .	-2.3223
Because of the interactions between the couples , the advice given , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in hand turns , it is very fascinating to observe the fourballs and foursomes from the nearest  po .	-4.1823
Europe has played better than team and has taken over the last day , but this foursome session has also shown that the team has the desire to combat what some , particularly Stateside , have doubted .	-4.3354
Europe Leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Finald   D    ' . The R i F .  	-6.7531
Europe will use a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-3.3879
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories about a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its previous record in the Le Golf National to four points .	-3.2622
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who appeared for the preservation of the trophy that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team with suspensers tomorrow , and won the series with 3-1 .	-3.8968
The US offered more resistance in the four and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-2.4601
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games from Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.2952
Fleetwood is the first European rooky , which wins four points , while he and Molinari , called " Molliwood " a sensational weekend after a sensational weekend , only the second pair wins four points from their first four games in the history of t Ryde C .	-4.0083
After they beaten woods and Patrick Reed into the fourballs , it was certain that they would strike a delicate wood and the American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau through an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.3209
Woods , who slugged through two parties on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 parties in four balls and four balls and seven .	-3.6078
Justin Rose , rested for the morning fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson to the Foursomes and beaten in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – one and three in the world .	-3.4078
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have its own way .	-3.2775
The three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the scale for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-2.9492
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the four-pack and returned to beat poulters and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the four-pack after they had lost the first two holes .	-4.0013
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , even though Halter Furyk 's page needs only a decision to keep the trophy .	-3.4215
However , after two days of second-hand , a Sunday account looks like it would go beyond them .	-3.7675
North Korea says that t “     N      Bu ” wil   n unilateral disarmament without trust	-2.9257
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its distrust with the United States and that the country would in no circumstances abandon its nuclear weapons unilaterally .	-3.5545
Ri Yong Ho said the Annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took significant goodwill measures last year , such as the attitude of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of nuclear tests and the commitment , nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-3.7124
" However , there is no appropriate response from the U " ,                  	-3.3339
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and , in such circumstances , there is no way to disarm ourselves first . ”	-3.1556
While Ri returned to the known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , which would reward North Korea with gradual steps , his statement seemed important in that it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-3.8638
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an official US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore , when Kim committed to working towards a ' denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula ' , while Trump promised guarantees of North Korea 's security .	-3.6123
North Korea sought a formal end of the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first give up its nuclear weapons .	-2.7416
Washington has also resisted the demands for a relaxation of hard international sanctions against North Korea .                 	-3.2045
The US insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increase pressure from sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compulsory manner , and even reject the " explanation of the war end " , said Ri .	-3.5147
" The perception that sanctions can force us into the knee is a dream of people who are ignorant to us  .     " T . " I           	-4.1973
But the problem is that the continued sanctions worsen our distrust . ”	-2.2381
Ri mentioned no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week .	-2.5088
Instead , the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and the South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the past five months : ' If the party were not in this issue of denuclearization of South Korea , not the US , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not be in such a deadlock ' .	-4.2414
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri 's speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported the U.N. , the General Assembly that took the U.S. mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called “ missile mission . ”	-4.3392
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to want to “ destroy North Korea , ” has praised Kim for his courage to take steps towards disarmament , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.5553
On Wednesday , Trump said that he did not have a timeframe and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , two years or five months ' .	-3.0412
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.7817
However , in the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo , the United Nations Security Council said on Thursday that ' The enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be energetically and without lack of continuation until we achieve the full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-4.0428
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the funding of the Pyongyang and Ballist missiles programmes .	-2.6387
Pompeo met Ri on the edge of the UN General Assembly and then said that he would travel to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.6142
Pompeo has already visited North Korea this year , but his last journey was not good .	-2.1593
He left Pyongyang in July , and said that progress has been made , and only a few hours condemned North Korea to make him “ pathetic demands . ”	-4.7312
This month , North Korea promised a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile location and also a nuclear complex when the United States takes ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.3981
He said Kim told him that the ' corresponding measures ' that he wanted to be security guarantees promised by Trump in Singapore , and steps towards normalizing relations with Washington .	-3.5742
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-2.2011
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of the study of the coffee-made " nights " .	-3.7719
A scientist has found that students are often ununderstood at a world leading university when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.2664
Charles Czeisler , Professor of Sleep Medicine at Harvard Medical School and Specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the U .	-3.4032
He was inspired to start the course after having held a lecture on the impact of sleep lack on learning .	-2.9683
At the end , a girl came to me and said : ' Why will that only now , in my final year , say ?	-3.2907
She said that ye never told someone of the importance of the sleep – which surprised me , " he said the telegraph .	-3.0178
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general wellbeing .	-3.2720
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University Health Service , said that the University had decided to introduce the course after having stated that the students had slept extremely little during the week .	-3.7585
The 1-hour course contains a number of interactive tasks .	-1.8538
In a section there is an image of a sleeping hall in which students click on coffee kettles , projects , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of coffee and light and about how the sporting performance is influenced by sleep and the importance of a sleeping time routine .	-4.5798
In another section , participants explain how long-term sleeping can increase the risk of heart infarction , heart accident , depression and cancer .	-3.6797
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-2.3280
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-1.7209
" But we believe that they have a right to this - just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke , cigarettes " , added Prof. Czeisler .	-3.4363
The culture of pride exists a " night to go through " , he said , adding that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students make sleeping a growing problem .	-3.7211
Sufficient sleep of good quality should be the ' secret weapon ' of a student to combat stress , exhaust and fear , he said - not to increase , because sleeping with the brain into hunger mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-4.4608
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler to design the course after he visited one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-3.0420
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push him on a campus-wide c .	-2.6574
The next step , hopes , is to ask all the docotorands to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition university .	-3.3225
Prof. Czeisler recommended students to set an alarm when they go to the bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " , which is broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circadian rhythm out of the tact , leading to problems with sleeping .	-4.7251
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal earth Gerrar      Men .               	-5.5742
Further the problems of the Rangers : After a meeting of Dolly Menga , there was a 1-to-0 defeat in Livingston for the unsome team of Steven Gerrard .	-4.5013
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since the 4 : 1-Triumph in St. Johnstone in February , but the team of Gary Holt added second defeat to       18 games as a  trainer who returned his team to eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke Premiership-Chief Hearts .	-4.3063
Menga landed seven minutes before the mid-term a meeting and an inspirational Rangers setting out not as if they could compensa .	-4.0648
While Rangers now fall back to the sixth place , climb Livingston on rank and are only because of the tordifference behind Hibernian .	-3.4257
New difficulties for the Rangers are characterised because , at line judges , Calum Spence , a headwound had to be supplied after having been taken by a throw object – seemingly thrown out from the fans s .	-6.6415
Gerrard made eight change to the page that passed at Ayr and failed directly to the semi-final of the Betfred Cup .	-3.4807
On the other hand , however , the same Livi Elf , which declined the Hearts last week , and he would have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not leave the opponents at any time for actions .	-4.7176
The Rangers dominated the ball , but Livingston set opportunities better .	-3.0530
You should have met after just two minutes when Menga ’ s first Ableger Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregors Tor , but the middle field player passed his great change on the gate .	-3.8688
A deep release of Keaghan Jacobs then went to Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far in the direction of behind posts .	-3.5523
Rangers took over control , but there seemed to be more hope than trust in their own game , on the last third .	-3.5248
Alfredo Morelos believed that , after the first quarter of the hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that he deserved an elfmeter after he collided and Steven Lawless , but arbitrary Steven Thomson did not introduce the Colombian appeals .	-6.3789
The Rangers reached only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox torshutter Liam Kelly was hardly to bring Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and the meeting of an unprecedented Ovie Ejaria .	-4.8542
Although Livi ’ s opening meeting might have been in the 34th minute contrary to the game , no one can deny that they deserve it for their efforts alone .	-3.7223
Again , Rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.2995
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that preserved the peace and picked Menga out for a simple finish .	-2.9217
Gerrard acted during the break when he transferred Coulibaly to Ryan Kent and the change has immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ranned from his line to block .              T  'Pr ' , the s  p '   C 	-6.6461
But Livingston always moved guests to play the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halkett after long balls .	-3.5084
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership at the final stage , but McGregor was well in order to refuse Jacobs before lithgov passed out of the corner .	-4.2585
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed entitlement to a punishment because he has avoided himself with jacobs , but once again he saw T  Thomson .	-3.9414

Having listed his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while he weared a Make America Great Mütze , he heated against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-3.7493

Although it was not broadcast , West ’ s film material was shared by Comic Chris Rock in the social media .	-2.8596
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the post .	-3.0894
West also complained about the audience that he had difficult behind the stage because of his head cover .	-3.2458

The US Maxine Waters rejected claims on Saturday , after which one of its employees should have published personal data from three Republican US senators to the Wikipedia pages of the legislators .	-4.0652
The democratic democracy based in Los Angeles is convinced that the claims of members of the ultra-left wing and website have been launched .	-3.4295
“ Lies , lies , and more recurrent lies , ” Waters shared in an opinion on Twitter .	-2.8457
Among the information published , reports include the private addresses and telephone numbers of the US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as the US Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , who come from Utah .	-3.8091
The information appeared online , posted by an unknown person on the capitol hill during a hearing of the Senate on the accusations of sexual misconduct of the Candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.4604
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-2.1434
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address , which identifies the source of jobs , was connected to Waters ' Office and released the information of an employee of Waters , reports Hill .	-3.4489
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” said Waters .	-2.5091
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal information , and security have been affected as a result of these fraudulent and wrong allegations – was in no way responsible for this information to be la .	-3.5032
This untenable claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.4978
Water ’ s declaration quickly led to criticism , including the former press secretary of the White House Ari Meat .	-2.9051
“ That the thing is denied is extremely annoying , ” wrote meat .	-2.5567
" This indicates that it is unsuitable as a congressmen .	-2.7854

They must not be broad .	-2.7491
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-2.0710

Review of " Johnny English – They live only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-2.6717
It is tradition to search for Brexit in every new film with British trend , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy Spoof Franchise .	-3.9952
Is the ironic self-satire about the new export opportunity of the nation at the abyss ?	-3.4889
In any case , the glossy , rubber and incompetent Johnny English received the license for the second time to remess things .	-6.1303
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent , who , despite his bizarre claims to Smoothie Glamour , has received a little clouseau , a jumper Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy , which has contributed one note to the lead melody of fire cars in the 2012 Olympic Games .	-5.1609

There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.7782
I loved Johnny English , who is closer to a helicopter in a medieval armor and the main rotor briefly beats his helmet .	-3.1101
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to see , but the humour feels quite weak and strange superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands like 007 and mission impossible offer comedy self-confident as an ingredient .	-3.9688
The humour feels rather than adult children , and for me the crazy missing skills of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean movies   .      T  ’     m  ’ a s .            	-8.7358
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in major difficulties .	-2.2274
A cyber-hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to hide the service agent – a small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.8676
It is the last Straw halm for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and combated personality and already suffers a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .	-3.5141
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as each individual active spy has been compromised , someone has to get out of retirement .	-4.0584
And this means that the great Pachy Johnny English himself , who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a noble facility , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as a Undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy about spying .	-5.4738
English is reunited for an emergency letter to Whitehall and has been reunited with its former , long-suffering Bough , played again by Ben Miller .	-3.6717
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overcrowded , burshikosis role in which Vicki Pepperdine does not entirely apply .	-3.8309
So , the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenkos beautiful femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.5686
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously in the ban of the charismatic tech billionaire that claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the darker Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.3175
English and Bough start their odyssey of colourful high-jinks : As a cellner , they dress a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board of Voltas Luxuryacht ; and English solves pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas House .	-4.4915
For this last sequence , all the registers have certainly been drawn , but so delightful and also let them remind the whole of children 's television .	-4.5352
Fairly moderate .	-1.7276
And , as with the other Johnny English films , I could not think around : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that is really fair to his talent ?	-3.4316
Labour denies having developed a plan for British a four-day week paid for five days .	-2.7866
Jeremy Corbyns Labour Party examines a radical plan where British work only four days a week , but five are paid .	-2.9320
According to reports , the party wants corporate heads to pass on the savings to the workers by the revolution of artificial intelligence ( KI ) by freeing them an extra day .	-3.8390
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money together .	-2.5964
Sources said that the idea would fit the economic agenda of the Party and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers .	-2.8542
The trade union congress has approved the change to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-2.9485
A high-level source from the Labour Party said Sunday Times : a review of policy is likely to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.6521
A four-day week is an objective that accords with the approach of the Party to restore the economic balance in favour of workers and the general industrial strategy of the party , but this goal will not be realised overnight .	-3.8386
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a fourth-day working week during its 2017 election campaign .	-3.0874
However , this advance is not currently being supported by the entire Labour Party .	-2.6904
A spokesman from the Labour Party said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.6593

The Shadow Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not retain their entire share , because a Labour government could make deductions because of supposed misconduct .	-4.0522

Because of an ongoing FBI investigation into accusations against judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote to appoint the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , and the question will be raised whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead to Republican senators to abandon their support for Kavanaugh .	-6.2068
In an interview transmitted on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes ” , asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s investigation could move them to change their opinion .	-4.2740
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.7858
“ In any case , ” said Kennedy .	-1.4169

The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international stakeholder group that has aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people who actively fight against them .	-3.1876
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , the concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering work , an e-mail to a leader in the world , a telephone call , or another sensible way of increasing the goal of combating poverty and strengthening the awareness of t this                                	-5.2558
But how successful is Global Citizen have been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.3833
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a genuine way of convincing people to call for action , or simply another case of the so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel as a result of signing an online petition or an online application or thereby a tweet as if they were to make a real difference                                                                          	-5.6098
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” of its supporters , who pushed for many different objectives .	-3.3302
It means that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments to more than $ 37 billion , which will have an impact on the life of more than $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.4589

As a response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.4622

Washington can “ when necessary ” use its marine to prevent Russian energy from achieving markets , including in the Middle East , US Interior Minister Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-3.8073
Zinke said that Russia ’ s commitment to Syria – especially in activities to invite the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.0133
“ I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is following : they want to negotiate energy , just as it does in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.9188
And , according to the officials , there are ways to deal with it .	-3.2098
“ The United States has this ability to ensure that sea ways are open and , if necessary , to block it to ensure that its energy does not come onto the market , ” he said .	-3.5621
Zinke talked about the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls themselves “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.0780
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are actually the same .	-3.2142
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-2.8818
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of their liquid natural gas to Europe and to replace Russia , the more favourable option for European consumers .	-3.2721
Members of the Trump administration – also US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to move Germany to a stop the “ unappropriate ” North-Stream-2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make “ prisoners . ”	-3.5814
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-2.8076
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s resistance to the project simply drives for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.2472

The Formal Weak Mickelson Saturday	-3.3406
American Phil Mickelson will establish a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he must dramatically improve his form so that it will not become a sad milestone .	-3.4020
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time in the event that took place every two years , was set to the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-2.9332
Instead of standing at the center of what happened so often for the US , the fivefold Major winner shared his day between fire and round of practice on the golf course , in the hope of overcoming his depth .	-4.0321
The 48-year-old is never the most straightforward driver at the height of his career and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National course on which the long Rough penalises regularly failures .	-4.2014
And as if the place alone were not enough challenge , Mickelson meets in the ninth match on Sunday on the British open champion , Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-3.8952
If Americans have four points during the launch of 12 individual games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-3.1908
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man ; what remained different .	-2.3975
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on the back and put his arm to me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.2262
“ He has a lot of confidence .	-1.6092
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-2.2339
I probably would not have thought he played two games .	-2.9430
I wanted more , but the way we had to address is that and that is the way we had  to tackle it .	-4.0731
He wants to be out there , just as everyone else .	-2.5366
So far , Nick Faldo holds the record about most played matches at the Ryder Cup , w will break Mickelson on Sunday .	-2.8848
This could mark the end of a Ryder cup career that has never fitted so much to the heights of its individual record .	-3.0684
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and seven times played decisively .	-8.4508
" He is witty , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to maintain people , and he is a great guy that he can have in the team room " he explained .	-4.1584
I think that the younger players had fun this week to measure with him , that was nice to view . ”    .               	-3.8985
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.5089
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a large lead can soon disappear .	-2.3042
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the individual games of the last day can quickly become an inconvenient ride at the Ryder Cup .	-3.3491
The Danes debuted in 1997 in the game in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points against the Americans , but only scarcely reached the target line and won with a thin lead of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-4.2802
" You remember that you were in Valderrama in leadership ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost .	-3.5458
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-1.9781
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-1.3609
Go there and do the right things .	-2.7635
It is only over when the points are displayed on the table .	-2.1370
Our objective is to win this cup , and that is what we focus on .	-2.7489
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we have a strong opponent to do the best players in the world . ”	-2.4950
Enthusiastically added his players on a hard golf course : " I would never be premature here .	-2.9201
Tomorrow is also a day .	-1.1850
The personal appearances are coming tomorrow and that is another thing .	-3.2707
It is great to be out with a partner when things are running well , but if you are out alone , then your own capabilities are tested as a golf player all over   i .	-4.9453
This is the message you have to convey to the players : tomorrow to catch out the best o                   	-3.8332
Now you pass on your partner and he must bring full use . ”	-4.2096
Unlike Björn , the opposite Jim Furyk will seek to ensure that his players separately decrease better than they do this as a partner , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have brought three of four points .	-4.2793
Furyk himself has already experienced such a sensational turning on the final day , and at that time he was part of the winner team in Brookline , now he belongs to the losers after the European team completed the “ miracle of Medinah . ”	-4.4603
" I remember every condemned word " he said how Ben Crenshaw , the 1999 captain , had gathered his players on the road to the last day .	-3.4783
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to get as quickly as possible as you see in Brookline , Medinah .	-3.2853
For the first time an own dynamic has developed , the big pressure on the middle matches is exerting .	-4.2464
We have built our setting accordingly , and the boys as we felt as we know , we try to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.0718

Once again , the German War   S     W   War Sh        D  &   C       	-5.7173
The most recent fregatte of the German Marine should have been served in 2014 to replace war vessels from the Cold War time in 2014 , which will take reports from local media at least to the next year . B it will take r  at  least t ne  y . I  w w s thi wi s t b c .	-7.0424
The commissioning of the Rhineland Palace , the guiding ship of the brand new fregattes of the Baden-Württemberg class , was now postponed to the first half of 2019 , such as the newspaper “ The Time ” under appeal to a military speaker .	-4.1607
The marine should have operated in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery had burdened the ambitious project .	-3.1214
The four ordered fregattens of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Marine in 2007 will replace the older vessels of the Bremen class .	-2.7294
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a number of aircraft and ship defense missiles and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-3.3780
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest fregates should be usable for two years without running the home port .	-3.9509
However , the state-of-the-art war vessels that Germany should enable a power projection in overseas will already be outdated by the constant delays if they are finally served , as the weekly newspaper remarks “ The Time . ”	-4.6762
The unfortunate F125 fregatte ensured headlines last year when German marines officially refused to operate the vessel and returned to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-3.3364
This was the first time that after the delivery , the marine returned a ship to a shipbuilder .	-2.5836
The reasons for reducing vessels were little known ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the warlord useless in combat inserts .	-3.9766
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the vessels of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by a crew of around 120 seafarers - only half of the occupation on the older fregattes of the Bremen class   .            	-3.8476
It also turned out that the ship has a considerable overweight , restricting performance and making future upgrades for the marine .	-3.4724
It is assumed that the 7,000-tonne “ Rheinland-Palace ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by Germans in World War II .	-3.1767
In addition to flawed hardware , the price shield of the entire project - including training of crew - will be on the topic .	-3.8843
Instead of the original EUR 2.2 billion , the costs appear to have achieved the diminishing amount of EUR 3.1 billion ( around $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.5952
The problems with the latest fregattes receive a special importance in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power diminishes .	-3.5083
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the warfleet actually “ go out of the ships that are operating . ”	-4.3382
The official said that the problem had grown largely over time , because old ships were put out of service without replacing it .	-5.2451
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregattens were served by the Marine .	-2.1185

The habitat card and the relevant report to be created should give a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-3.2270
Rob Dewar , natural protection consultants at the National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of the habitat area are the most important for the fledermic mice and how they are used by their species .	-4.1342
This information will help to identify the advantages of habitat management , such as measurement education and how best to receive forests for barbecue mice and other species involved .	-5.5054
There has been a strong decline in the field mouse populations in Scotland and the UK over the last hundred years .	-3.2133
They are threatened by construction works that have an impact on their sleeping courses and the loss of l 'a  l l 'area .	-3.6277
Wind power facilities and lighting can also be a risk , as well as flying strips and some chemical treatments of building materials ,                                   	-4.9531

The organization has even established Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated Fledermausreservat in threade property in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish fleather mouses are homed .	-4.1621
According to manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.1862
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for battle mice .                   	-3.3926
" We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good habitat .	-2.4524
But there is still much unknown about battle mice and the work we are doing here and other properties helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.4894
He stresses that it is important to check before maintenance work in buildings , according to him it is possible for up to 400 females and boys to be destroyed by an individual sleeping course of mother animals – under conditions a whole local population .	-5.4954
Battle mice is protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass , or disturb them and destroy their sleeping courses .	-3.3282
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.0064

He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production in their work in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain were to leave the EU without a deal .	-3.3204
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.4129
The Japanese automotive manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the case of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-2.9726
The plant in Burnaston , which manufactures Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced last year almost 150,000 cars , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.1203
“ When Britain leaves the EU without an agreement at the end of March , I believe that in our work on production stops , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO at Toyota in Burnaston .	-3.7250
Other British automotive manufacturers have expressed concerns to leave the EU without agreement on cross-border trade modalities , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.7479
For example , BMW has already announced to close his work in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-2.4360
The most important concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a " no deal Brexit " .	-2.7286
The Toyota production facilities are based on needs-oriented manufacturing , i.e. parts are supplied every 37 minutes from the United Kingdom and the EU for special production .        T & B  i i s a          	-5.0001
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there can be delays on the border which , according to industry specifications , can lead to supply bottlenecks and partial shortages .	-3.8004
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stock in his work in Derbyshire , the company said , and thus production would be stopped .	-2.7553
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “ precisely calibrated to avoid these checks on the border . ”	-2.6769
We have to have a deal , and we want the best deal which not only allows us to succeed , but we also want to take this opportunity , but he said the BBC Radio 4 progra                         	-4.6236
“ The reference not only to Toyota but also other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-2.9789
Toyota did not determine how long the production stop could take , but warned that the cost increase in the long term suffered the competitiveness of the work and , finally , lost jobs .	-3.9959
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives , and for 24 years in Burnaston , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ In my experience , jobs are lost forever once they are reduced . ”	-3.4933

Trump ’ s Meeting with Rosenstein could move again , says the White House	-2.5178
Donald Trump ’ s high-class meeting with the deputy general prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be postponed ' another week ' because the fight for the Supreme Court continues Brett Kavanaugh reads the White House on Sunday .	-4.0371
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser Robert Mueller , who investigates Russian interventions into the elections , the links between Trump and Russia and the possible disability of justice by the President .	-3.2766
Whether Trump will fire or not the deputy general prosecutor , and so that the independence of Muller is jeopardised , Washington has been a lot of track for months .	-4.3383
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the wearing of a cable to record discussions with Trump and make it possible to remove the President of the 25th Constitutional Addition .	-3.1303
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.2341
But last Monday he came to the White House , while there were reports that he was just before the resignation .	-3.1583
Instead , a meeting with Trump , which was announced at that time at the United Nations in New York , was announced .	-2.7579
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who had accused him of sexual misconduct .	-3.8331
On Friday , Trump arranged a week FBI investigation into Kavanaugh ’ s requirements , and continued to delay a full se vote .	-3.6815
Donald Trump ’ s press speaker Sarah Sanders was on Sunday to see Fox News .	-2.0828
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' An appointment for this has not yet been set , it might be this week , I could see that I will be sliding back another week , given all the other things that are taking place with the Supreme Court .	-4.9316
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-2.1681
Some reporters would cut this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.6537
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.2119
Sanders said that the lack of briefings did not reflect on television reporters who are behaving like self-representatives , but she also said : " I will not be against they stand on the gallery . "	-4.4816
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.7913
" The President carries out more questions and answers when every President said before him " , she added , without calling evidence : " We have looked at these figures " .	-3.7309
Briefings will still take place , Sanders said , but should have the press the opportunity to ask questions to the President of the United States directly , whether it is infinitely better than to speak to it .	-3.8370
We are trying to do a lot of what you have seen , as we have done in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conversation if you can speak to the President of the United States themselves . ”	-3.2206
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignity media .	-2.4438
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.3379
In New York , the President perhaps showed this week why he made a freely and sometimes bizarre performance before assembled reporters .	-3.2732

Foreign buyers must pay a higher tax if they acquire a property in Britain	-2.8930
Foreign buyers will be imposed on a higher tax when buying a property in Britain with the additional money used to help homeless within the framework of new Tory plans .	-3.4729
This step will neutralize the success of Corbyn ’ s efforts to attract young voters	-2.3582
The tax will be imposed on those who do not pay taxes	-2.4555
The Ministry of Finance expects multi-income revenues of up to 120 million pounds annually to flow into homeless support .	-3.7147
Foreign buyers will be taken into account a higher stamp tax rate in the purchase of real estate in Britain - the additional money will be used for homeless , announces Theresa May today .	-3.8654
This step is seen as an attempt to neutralize Jeremy Corbyn ’ s success , attract young voters with promises to offer more affordable housing and seek high incomes .	-3.1281
The stamping charge is collected to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK , and the additional money will support the government in combating homelessness .	-4.0301

The Ministry of Finance expects more than 120 million pounds per year .	-2.6832
About 13 % of the new buildings in London are acquired by buyers who are not living in Britain , driving prices into the amount , making it more difficult to purchase a real estate .	-7.0676
Many prosperous regions of the country , especially the capital , have developed into “ ghost cities , ” because the many foreign buyers spend most of their time outside the country .	-3.4945
The new policy comes just a few weeks after Boris Johnson had called for a stamp tax section to help more young people have their first house .	-2.8075
He accused large construction companies to keep property prices by purchasing buildings favourably , but he has also called on Mrs May to abolish quotas for affordable apartments to end the housing misery in Britain   .   T        .	-4.7265
Mr Corbyn has announced a pregnant series of proposed housing reforms , including rental controls and ending independent spaces .	-3.1842
It also wants to give the Councils more powers to build new house .	-4.2845
Mrs May said , “ Last year I said that I devote my prime minister to reviving the British dream – life should be better for every new generation .	-3.2411
And that means bringing our brand housing market into order .	-3.1725
Britain will always be open to people who live here and want to work and build a life .	-2.1903
However , it cannot be right that it is just as simple for foreign companies and people who do not live in the United Kingdom to buy homes as for hard-working British citizens .	-3.4579
For too many people , the dream of housing is all too far away , and the dignity of homelessness remains too real .	-2.6304

The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he had no fear of entering the footsteps of these established managers in such a large club , and he had already rejected offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town .	-3.7117
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I return this association to the Prime League ? "	-2.6066
With its structure and its facilities , this club is no doubt in the Premier League , “ he said .	-2.9942
" It is not an easy task there , but I would probably see myself as successful if I can return the club there .  "	-3.5567

Milk pump advertising , compared with cows , led to controversial online discussions	-2.3673
A milk pump company has created too controversial online discussions because of an advertising that compares quick mothers with melk cows .	-4.9951
On the occasion of the market introduction of the allegedly " worldwide noiseless and portable milk pump " , the consumer technology Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show which freedoms are offered with this new pump .	-4.0637
Four real mothers dance in a household in the middle of cows to a number with the following song text : " Yes , I milk me , but you see no tail " and " If you have not noticed that there are no purposes , there are my breasts " .	-3.8924
The slogan continues to go on : " Pump down , pump , I feed the babies , pump down , pump down , I my ladies . "	-4.2760
The display published on the Facebook page , however , has provided online controversy .	-3.0176
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from the viewers , many of whom say that it highlights the " horror " of the dairy sector .	-3.2972

At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the decent pumps in their BHs .	-2.5734

The number of detained children with the background of migration rose , although monthly border crossings have remained relatively unchanged , partly because the hard rhetoric and policy of the Trump government made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-4.9943
Traditionally , most sponsors themselves have been undocumented immigrants and fear that they are risking the country when they use a child .	-2.8456

The Chairman of the Democratic Minority Group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court “ hysterical ” and said that he was inappropriate from the temperament to serve the Supreme Court .	-3.4119
Pelosi made the comments at an interview Saturday on the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-2.3196
“ I could not be different from thinking that if a woman had ever behaved so , she had called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-3.6552
Kavanaugh demented the allegations emotionally loaded that he attacked Dr. sexually ; Christine Blasey Ford , when they were both young people .	-3.0131

“ I believe that he said himself with such statements and the way in which he can affect himself from the Clintons and the Democrats , ” she said .	-3.4849
When she was asked whether , in the case of his confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , she would seek an attack against Kavanaugh .	-4.0942

Kavanaugh is currently district judges in D.C. Appeal Court .	-2.1528
Pelosi added that she was concerned as a democrat about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , as he stands for conservative justice .	-3.0763
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh has evolved into questions whether he would tighten certain decisions by the Supreme Court .	-3.8778

" I do not think that this is unusual , or ? "	-1.6616
