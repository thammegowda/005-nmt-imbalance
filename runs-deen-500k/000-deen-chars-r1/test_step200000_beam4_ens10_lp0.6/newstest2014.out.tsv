Gutach : Even more security for pedestrians	-1.5535
There are no 100 meters away from each other : Tuesday the new B 33 pedestrian lamps at the village parking lot have been operated in Gutach - in the view of the older town hall .	-5.2423
Two plants so close to each other : Intention or citizenship ?	-2.7194
This question clearly answered Gutach ’ s mayor yesterday .	-2.1147
" The City House Ample was installed at that time because they secure the school way " , explained corner yesterday .	-3.5507
The cluster traffic safely both cyclists and bus passengers and mountain residents .	-3.1120
The plant officially taken yesterday is important for the crossing area of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraß .	-3.1082
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow of the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.3838
" In the high traffic and pedestrian revenue , another traffic light had to be secured , " said Eckert .	-5.0030
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Offenburg Office .	-2.1537
" According to current measurements on the B 33 daily , about 12 000 vehicles emphasize the town of Gutach , of which around ten percent heavy-load traffic is emphasized b Arnold .	-4.2958
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Security just goes here " , said Arnold .	-3.3576
Overall , four traffic looks have been carried out , and a roundabout has also been thought , but again because of the anger in the crossing area of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstraße .	-4.7777
According to Arnold , everything has been experienced at the location of the traffic masters before : " Through an extra for us with particularly long wooden tribes of loaded transporters , we have equipped whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without hiding the traffic masts " .	-6.3714
The around EUR 15 000 expensive light itself is the " most modern thing there are currently on the market " , explained Arnold .	-3.6890
The plant is equipped with coloured LEDs , which highlight so strongly that the lights are good to be seen by the drivers , for example with deep sun .	-5.1394
And it is also economical : the older lighting facilities consume about 100 Watts , the new time eight watts .	-4.3774
There are three light systems per direction .	-1.9244
Arnold explained the technology of the new system : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.5505
Press the pedestrian the light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic location .	-3.0688
If the road is free , it comes immediately green for pedestrians , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.2650
Another radar sensor checks if the green phase can be ended for pedestrians .	-5.0870
" If a group or disabled people go over the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone comes safely about the tram " , explained Arnold .	-3.6936
Of course , the driver has to think as a partner and monitor the train .	-3.2751
This was not the case yesterday : little showed the traffic for pedestrians green , rushed an upper class vehicle through - in light re   .                	-4.1452
Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years .	-2.0707
The catastrophes of its Catholic village childhood - the linguistic , the slogan to raw violence and stemming sexuality , the closeness and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet .	-4.8536
The Bochner Prize winner is primarily known as a prose author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-3.4561
Collage from prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher provides for his performance " weather lights on the tongue " , which is now to be seen in Garage X at the Petersplatz , therefore collage from prosatexts .	-5.1048
The theatre maker connects elements from the autobiographically characterized novel " The Leibeigene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family blue " ( 2003 ) .	-4.0870
On the largely empty stage - important requisite : a crushed sofa , which is copulated and masturbated strongly - the eight-headed ensemble is rising through the text material .	-4.8873
Director Fresacher seems little to trust the text .	-1.9484
The 70-minute performance overturns the template with a wide range of government accidents known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms .	-5.9821
Above all , the actresses are somewhat questionable Scenic implementation .	-3.0138
They are taken hard with the head of water , tackered with their evening robes .	-3.9258
Incorporated into cellophane or almond , stacs they on dangerously high blocks by staging , either monologizing them loud or lying completely stupid on the stage floor .	-5.3060
However , the text does not convey in this way .	-3.1052
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular song .	-2.7217
Only against the end comes the turned performance something to tranquil , and Winkler ’ s absurd humour flashes .	-4.7925
A blackbox in the car ?	-1.3419
US road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that finds place in the arms board of each car .	-3.8041
The devices that record every kilometre and report information to the authorities are the key point of a controversial attempt by Washington and the planning offices of the states to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads .	-3.6921
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly embraced an intense debate with colourful alliances .	-3.2160
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and argued that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax modes  .                                  	-4.8078
The Tea Party is appointed .	-2.0622
American civil rights association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.4687
But , while the Congress cannot agree on action , several states are no longer waiting for so  .	-3.2760
You are currently examining how they can change to a system over the next ten years where drivers pay per driver .	-3.3564
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs of some with GPS monitoring .	-3.5624
That is really a must for our country .	-1.6473
“ It is nothing we may be using only , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , managing director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the driven miles at all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .	-3.9405
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.5230
The technology is there .	-1.7826
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from the taxes that Americans are putting on the pillar , is led .	-4.7997
But America is no longer danked as much before .	-2.6691
Cars consume less petrol .	-1.0526
The government tax of 18.4 cents per gallon ( less than 4 Eurocent per litre ) has not risen for 20 years .	-2.8117
Politicians dare not dare to increase the tax in high spring prices .	-3.3565
“ Petrol interest tax is simply not future-free , ” Lee Munnich , an expert for transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.1213
His state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.5500
“ This is the most sensible long-term alternative , ” he said .	-2.1458
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-1.9648
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals is finding , for the tax could be used to influence driving behaviour so that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust is reduced .	-4.1305
The California planners rely on the system of developing strategies to achieve the ambitious , legally enshrined goals of the state on climate change .	-3.5332
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that he sees the most powerful long-term alternative in it .	-2.9141
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also done by the idea of paying drivers after route .	-3.2228
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” Adrian Moore declares Vice-President for Reason directives .	-2.6373
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.6431
The movement is also supported by two previous American transport ministers , who called on Congress in a report in 2011 to move towards mile-based bills .	-3.3223
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million of expensive pilot projects last year , covering 10,000 cars .	-2.5404
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the pressure and thus responded to the concerns of Members from rural areas who represent people who often have to settle many miles on the road to work or to the city i day life .	-4.7754
Several states and major cities are moving at their own fist in this direction .	-5.5656
The most committed is Oregon , which is currently 5,000 drivers for the largest experiment in the country  .         	-3.4645
These drivers will soon pay the mileage fees instead of mineral oil tax to the federal st .	-2.7508
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.3553
New York City also considers such .	-2.3900
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .	-2.4495
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , investigates how to introduce the change .	-3.6097
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.0944
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were equipped with the equipment recently , drivers were sceptical when the government could pursue each of its movements .	-3.2723
“ Concerns against Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management in the Transport Ministry of Nevada .	-2.8980
People did not want it .	-1.1074
When the test supplied , the Nevada ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into adult monitoring devices . ”	-3.5939
There is no need to build a gigantic , blocked technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-2.9843
Nevada belongs to a number of states that now look after affordable technology , with which the state can capture the driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-3.4103
Khan would also be more reassured by the public .	-4.2684
Hunting after this technology , some authorities have led to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.2616
The company has originally not occurred to help states tax drivers .	-2.9619
Instead , it was their objective to take foot in an emerging market for vehicle insurance drivers to pay on the basis of the driven miles .	-4.4582
But the devices tested are also interesting for the street planners , because they do not work with GPS and deliver limited information that is uploaded regularly by modem .	-3.5128
“ People are more ready to participate in if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-3.0400
Some of these public pilot programs have made major mistakes .	-2.0087
There are significantly cheaper and less intrusive opportunities for implementing this .	-2.4943
In Oregon , the planners experiment to give drivers a series of selections .	-3.7862
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.8236
Or they do not choose any device and instead pay a lounge fee on the basis of the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state .	-3.7384
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a mistrustful public by equipping the devices with more functions than with less .	-2.8264
In New York City , transport officers want to develop a taxation device that allows parking fees to be paid , insurance must be paid only for driven kilometres and speed data collected by other vehicles in real-time thanks to their drivers .	-4.7095
“ Drivers would be motivated through the added value of the benefits that the system offers to participate ” in a city planning document .	-3.5287
However , some transport planners are wondering whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion manoeuvre .	-3.1743
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , Congress can simply solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax .	-3.2082
An additional unique charge or annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-3.4941
“ There is no reason for operation , if an aspirin is sufficient , ” Randy Rentschler , the Chief Leader of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission . Ther is no reason for o operation .	-3.8930
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are concerned about their privacy and many other things .	-2.5338

The volunteer fire dealt with its autumn sample despite staff lack of bravour .	-3.8656
Only 11 man took part in the exercise .	-1.6233
Hans Kammerer had selected the property of Feder in the Burgberger Straße in his training acceptance .	-4.2976
A short closure should be created in saws .             i       	-5.2954
Two people were violated by the creating fire and smoking development , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-3.1502
Two breathing carriers of the world were prepared to enter the building after the first review of the fact by Hans Kammerer .	-4.3716
After a short time we were able to find the first person and guide to the outdoor .	-3.4084
The second person had to be borne .	-1.3350
This was not as easy as there was a close stairway too .	-4.0053
The building , a workshop with integrated stability for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.4624
It stored a lot of wood and electricity balls in it .	-2.7722
Furthermore there were electrical machines for wood processing .	-2.7449
The first extinguishing attack was carried out o tank in th ve           	-3.3894

The building also used a hollow-ray tube .	-3.8744
Hans Kammerer also demonstrated the exercise of what should be done with little available s .	-3.8058
In the ernst case , a support from the Königsfeld day-to-day group is supported .	-4.0580

Important Networking of Universities and Companies	-2.0861
At his visit to the Breisgau-Hochschwarzforest district , President Guido Wolf could also be explained in Titisee-Neustadt about where tomorrow ’ s labor comes .	-4.2325
At the High Black Forest Centre , together with the Managing Directors of Professional Schools and the gymnasium of circles and parental chairman of this important issue .	-4.4951
" Education is an important location factor " , underlined by Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project High-Black Forest Educa .	-3.4889
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-3.1098
Since 2011 , the forest city has existed successful cooperation between support centre , gymnasium and professional school centre .	-3.3237
He also praised the family friendliness in the district .	-2.2405
" It is important not only to have the family stage in mind , but also due to demographic change the phase for care for members of their care , " Wolf explained .	-4.1933
In addition , he assumed that more and more employees took care of their families ’ care and s care   .	-4.4709
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden of employees can lead to an end to the work relationship , " said Wolf .	-2.9591
But nobody can afford to lose qualified workers , he said further .	-2.4507
Another particularly important factor is the interconnection of universities and companies . T            	-2.9480
" Because who has already met the advantages of the region during his studies , its knowledge and capabilities often receive the regional economy , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , " the President of Land was convinced .	-4.5024
Because only if sufficient training places were offered can the need for professionals also be covered  .	-3.2998
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its beneficial location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.3971
He also experienced the efforts already made for the development of public transport on his train ride from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg .	-3.7429
" Remain strong and ensure that public transport is better " , he explained to the address of the local politicians present .	-3.4723

The over 100 years old natural stone wall as the front delimitation of the old school house to the Kirchstraße , which was founded again , should be set on the city ’ s refurbishment cost plan .	-7.1731
During the days before the Kilbig , a small angle wall , stabilization and static discharge of the more than a hundred years old natural stone wall was built with balustrade .	-4.4088
The other approach provides that Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Town Office includes the country monument in the plannings and create a refurbishment concept for the old wall .	-4.6920
Afterwards , a cost calculation should be made by professionals who will then be putting on the table to the Community Council for the decision and definition of the further ap .	-4.4158
A decision on this will likely be taken next year .	-2.3470
After the refurbishment , pavement and tree planting of the old school court within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 , school must be renovated in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure , the restrictive limitation wall from scratch to restructuring and putting into new subsidies              	-6.1996
The historic , one hundred years old definition wall of the old school house to the Kirchstraße , is particularly through water and frost damage , since no drainage is available , renovation needs and has an archery forward .	-5.1341
Deep cracks in individual stones show weather damage , but the wall is not currently under threat .	-4.3556
A stand-safe wall is a prerequisite for a school house used by students , which has been done by the current fortification work .	-3.5845
Originally , the school renovation was even planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high implanned expenditure brought a shift .	-3.6788
An important word in the historical school wall renovation , which has even been used for film recordings , will say the country monument .	-5.1648
If this page comes from this page , the city of Bräunlingen hopes to subsidies from the monuments .	-5.4671

" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training in the Stuttgart music education education " , said Zezdemir the " Stuttgart News " .                 	-3.8972
Jazz and classic are just part of the Stuttgart Jazz site .	-3.3148
This contradicts Zedemir , who is considered to be the Green Red Government in Stuttgart as a favorite for a direct mandate at the Bundestag election on September 22 .	-4.5207
On the basis of an expert study , this forces a reorganization of the five music education schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.5066
Afterwards , among other things , the study entrance jazz and pop should be relocated from the Stuttgart music education college , Mannheim .	-7.1615
US Border : " Super-Tunnel " discovered Drug Smuggling	-2.7298
On the border between Mexico and the US , investors have discovered and closed a super tunnel to drug smuggling .	-3.0605
As the US customs authorities stated , the more than 500 metres were long tubes between Tijuana and San Diego with electricity , rail tickets and an avenue  sys .	-3.8033
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of Marihuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine were confiscated .	-2.8952
According to the tunnel , the information was not used yet .	-2.7069
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could go through away under the radar , " said the general prosecutor of the US District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference before a storage house in San Diego , where an end of the tunnel was discovered .	-4.1496
Turned to the drug gangs , assured Duffy : " If you continue to build and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.0234
Both the US and Mexican security forces are in a permanent struggle against drug cartels  .	-2.3148
More than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico since 2006 in connection with drug crime .	-2.6558
Constructed by experts	-1.1382
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investors assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place around a year .	-3.3945
The plant was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars were used the  c  .	-4.3964
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building which is 80 meters from the border .	-2.6982
According to the authorities , a leader leads 20 meters into the depth to the tunnel .	-3.1962
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimetres width .	-2.1655
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-2.3223
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the Cocaine Fund .	-2.0860
The third , a Mexican , was taken because of the confiscated Marihuana .	-2.2794
All three is threatening as the maximum penalty of lifelong liberty , as officials said .	-2.9038
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , the press conference in San Diego continued to discov t  s .	-3.4321
But it is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction .	-2.6572
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities and not through tunnels .	-4.1258
This shows the " despair " of the drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut , said Bill Sherman from the drug track DEA in San Diego .	-3.6895
They would do everything to get to the US .	-1.8849
No details have been announced with regard to the arrested parties , at least one of them is Mexicans , w  sa t  c  n	-4.6251
They must expect up to ten years of prison .	-2.2510
2014 Becomes Geisinger Festyahr	-1.7744
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen at the 1250 .	-2.9243
Returning to the first original mention is becoming increasingly closer .	-3.3309
When the year ends in good eight weeks , the annual year stands .	-3.0991
Spiritual singings and churches houses were mentioned for the first time in a w  o  o 'c a c       	-6.1089
A church has been produced in which both places are mentioned .	-3.0095
On 15 March there should be an official appeal to the anniversary year , and since spirits have no hall at the moment , this event will take place in the place where 1250 years ago , both were mentioned for the first time , in church houses .	-4.9530
Within the framework of the anniversary , several events are planned both in spirits and in churches .	-3.3992
Church houses will be the 1250 in July on a Festival weekend from July 18th to 20t .	-3.3393

This will be finished in the anniversary year , the official date is on the last September weekend , 27 and 28 September .	-3.6322
On the occasion of the Geisinger urban anniversary , a new chronic is also put  o  t  .           	-4.7312
" But it should be a chronic not only of spirits themselves , but a printed work about the spirits of today , which consists of spirits , churches , houses , paralysis , aulfings and good madings " , says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-5.6686
And the spirits of today celebrated in 2014 , and in 1974 the current space was completed with incommunications .	-3.8685
The new chronic should then be presented in Seisingen on 21 or 22 November in the ne          Festhalle      .	-3.1339

Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same context .	-2.2133

Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-2.2990
It is particularly important to increase the safety of rail transitions - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles .  T  . T     . T    .	-7.5174
If the communities agree with the reconstruction measures , they must take part in the costs , the rest share their railways and federations .	-4.1009
Schiltach 's city mayor Roland Grießhaber explained the council of municipality the specific nature of the transition " Am Hir "            .	-4.3585
There , the city plans to build an exploration in the amount of the tunnel mouth there wes .	-3.8537
There could also be larger vehicles , for example , transporting long wood , where counter-traffic is counter-traffic , without having to block the track .	-5.6183
Greezhaber therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city can spread the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of t traffi .     T                     	-4.1798
This has been discussed more controversially in the Council , as some Councils drew the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , with his statement , brought the mood of critics to the point : ' Do we need to take so much money for so few vehicles ? '	-4.6396
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : The transition " Hirschen " is used regularly for long-wood transport .	-3.1101
Even wood from the area " Kuhbach " is transported partly via this route , because the up to 20 meters long vehicles could not use the track on the haver reading bridge because they could not turn there into the main road .	-4.4557
Furthermore , the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel if the main road is locked , argued haas .	-3.6603
There is also an important importance of transport for a longer period for a longe     transport . I    m  .	-7.8037
The Councils agreed to investigate what costs would cause the intended spread of the road  .	-2.9608
Notwithstanding this , the majority of the railways were agreed with the measure that the necessary support wall is built in such a way that the city can expand the subsequent road towards the railway station , if necessary for encounter traffic to around 5.5 meters .	-5.1193
The rebuilding of the transition to the Gerberei Trautwein could , on the other hand , draw a very different problem affecting the accident in the very rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-4.7595
The administration had studied the conversion plans of the railway from the engineering office Breinlinger , as it had doubts about whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser way was even without any further possibility .	-4.3109
The investigation came to the result that it would not be excluded that the tendency ratios of the street could lead to longer vehicles sitt  up .	-4.3399
The responsibility for this is the city as a road burden .	-3.6456
The reconstruction can therefore be liable for liabilities .	-3.6655
Since both the wooden service and the turn into the current state of expansion , you should not agree to reconstruct the transition , argued haas .	-4.5636
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of train with a vehicle on the transition is much less than the other transitions , because there are directly next to the middle of the stop to which there is good visibility   .	-5.3090
Even trains from the central railway station would have to be at this point at the extent that no collision is threatening .	-3.5211
The majority of these railways have been refused to approve the conversion of this transition , because the city of Shiltach would have to expand the problem with seated vehicles " , since the Councils can withdraw from responsibility after the construction work can be completed .	-6.0994
As unproblematic , the board considers the rebuildings on the transitions " Prior to Heubach " and " Pre-Kuhbach " , for which crossing agreements have already been made with the railway                	-4.9525
Esa decides on large space missions : missions for billions	-2.1568
Far planets , gravity waves or black holes - experts from the European space agency must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the coming years .	-3.1540
30 proposals were selected , five are still in the race .	-2.1260
Far worlds .	-1.1037
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers .	-1.8412
Whether there are at least some of them , nobody knows .	-2.2251
The selection falls hard : should you look for gravity waves ?	-3.2892
Or do you prefer to explore the origin of the                 co       c	-3.2100
Or after a little planet , perhaps discovering extraordinary life ?	-3.6246
These questions are precisely those responsible for the European Space Agency Esa .	-2.4439
For their programme " Cosmic Vision " they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that will make the research crucial prog .	-3.9453
The budget for such " L missions " is about a billion euros .	-4.2882
The start will likely be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.6517
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-3.4422
30 ideas have been the debate , five of them have now come into the closer election .	-3.6667
Numerous bodies view the proposals , with researchers .	-3.2195
Over the coming days , a final decision should be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-2.7442
Overall four major questions , the Esa has chosen to find answers to the missions of the 2007-initiated Cosmic Vision programme .	-2.8075
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.6854
The exact transactions in the creation of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets that transform these stars - are still in the spiritual darkness .	-4.5665
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this dark .	-2.4804
And if a star has planet under what circumstances can life emerge ?	-2.5834
In order to address this question , in 2017 the world space telescope " Cheops " will be studied in our nearer surroundings with the 500 already known planetary systems .	-4.5059
But the possibilities are limited , cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.4268
With greater instruments , the astronomers could display and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres and seek to " biomarkers " : gases that apply to biological activity .	-4.1069
How does the solar system work ?	-1.1469
This question , too , should eventually give rise to the conditions for the emergence of life .	-4.5800
An important role plays the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of his magnetic field as well as the particle radiation that he bases with the planetary system .	-3.7229
In our solar system , these transactions can be exemplary .	-2.5856
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already adopted a mission of the M-class ( the budget is approved by around half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-3.8633
The sond should start in 2017 and watch the surface and activity of the sun closely .	-4.1267
Jupiters and his moons are of great interest to researchers .	-1.8682
They want to find out the role of the giant planet in developing the solar system .	-2.3032
For this , the Esa provides for the first of the total three L missions of the Cosmic Vision program  .	-2.8197
The son " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) starts their journey in 2022 .	-2.3621
Eight years later , she reaches Jupiter and should examine the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moon of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.5782
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.3455
The world 's valley offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the well-known natural laws are still valid there .	-3.5210
Perhaps deviations that physicians could point to a new theory under which all known natural laws can be united .	-3.4911
How did the universe create and what is it ?	-2.2721
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos were created through the bank .	-3.5325
In addition to the extensive matter from the stars , planets and living beings such as us , there are dark matters that hold galaxies and clusters together , and dark energy through which the expansion of world valley accelerates .	-4.6091
So far , researchers know which physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the bird , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .	-3.5994
With Euclid , the Esa has already approved a M mission whose start is foreseen for 2020 .	-3.3283
With a special telescope , the special should examine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time in the entire sky and thus enable conclusions on the procurement of dark matter and dark energy .	-4.2387
Those who could do the Race	-1.5835
Of the 30 proposals , at the end of the selection procedure , only two will remain .	-2.1840
The best opportunities for granting an L-Mission , according to many experts , have a demanding concept to prove gravitation waves .	-3.6740
Including physicists understand changes in the structure of space time , which Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-2.8731
They have not been demonstrated to da   to    t    .  T	-3.3586
Elisa could create this , hope the scientists behind the project .	-2.2802
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three species , which is stationed in all .	-2.8846
It could also demonstrate gravitational waves , unlike equipment on the earth , which have emerged with the bird , and thus provide new findings about the cosmos .	-5.6900
Four other proposals are competing for the second L mission : a large radio gentlescope called " Athena " , which is to explore , among other things , black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planet of the sun system , " Prism " , a mission for measuring cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which should detect and investigate endless planets .	-5.2681
Among other things , proposals on sample return transport from Mars , the research of moon , venus and asteroids and solar physics are already different .	-4.4100
Snowden is prepared to “ cooperate ”	-1.6181
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has explained that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and to say before the German Bundestag when American National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander do not give any answers about their activities .	-3.8655
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum has received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-2.8758
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , this writes : “ Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a divergent opinion as faithful and try to criminalize political expression with criminal threat , which is not possible to defend . ”	-4.6986
The truth to say is not a crime .	-1.5140
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can convince the American Government to fall the charge against him .	-3.1876
The charge conditioned by the US Department of Justice includes spying and theft of state ownership .	-3.1664
German Interior Minister Hans-Peter Friedrich said online against time : “ When Mr Snowden is prepared to talk to German representatives , we find ways to enable this . ”	-3.3232
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has listened to Chancellor Angela Merkel 's mobile phone .	-2.8298
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who led the parliamentary committee responsible for the intelligence service , said that we should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as witnesses if this is possible , “ without jeopardising it and ruining relations with the United States .                 	-4.4919
Ströbele , a Member of the Greens , published an image of themselves and snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.3398
He was accompanied by two German journalists when visiting Russia .	-3.0798
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he left the country .	-2.7445
When Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , so the Member .	-2.9793
Snowden explains in his letter that he would be exposed to a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that has driven him from his homeland  .	-4.7866
He is , however , touched on the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.5417
Citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including the United States – have called revelations on an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit of general unity .	-3.3133
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ when the difficulties have been resolved around the humanitarian situation . ”	-2.6936
Frontier Airlines charges fees for hand baggage	-2.0292
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who want to stop hand baggage on their flight .	-2.9242
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to 100 US dollars for a piece of hand baggage and 2 dollars for coffee or limonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday was to read that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-3.5316
The new fee is valid for hand baggage in the baggage over the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-3.1566
Frontier explained that we calculate $ 25 when the charge is paid in advance , and $ 100 at travellers who paid only at the flight . T ' s a s d '  a $ 1 ( $ 100 ) .	-6.8001
Frontier-Speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is aimed at moving travellers to take care of payment in advance .	-3.5914
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.1742
Airlines started in 2008 to request fees for the first and second baggage piece .	-3.1109
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have therefore stopped into the hand baggage as much as possible , which means that the baggage areas are often overfully o the seat .    I w        ha           	-6.2361
Fees are an opportunity to move passengers to take less on board .	-2.4637
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-1.9428
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier , who had expressed clearly that it becomes increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment over the seat .	-4.4471
Passengers who buy your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-2.1493
This means that a passenger at the aircraft of Frontier may take a baggage free of charge , but the next person must pay $ 100 for comparable baggage .	-3.7091
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed about the charge before they could come to the flight .	-3.6437
The new hand baggage fee of Frontier will only enter into force in the summer , and there is still no date yet .	-3.6410
Passengers frequently shimp over baggage supplements and other charges , but airlines will be happy to return to it .	-3.8449
They argue that baggage transport should cost money and pay this service if they wanted i .	-2.7132
Many of the Wall Street regard the new baggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of airlines after years of losses .	-3.0086
However , most so far leave the fingers of charges for hand baggage .	-2.8745
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested three years ago as the first charges for hand baggage and later Allegiant Air followed , also a cheap flight .	-3.0491
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , explained the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-3.1737
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand baggage fee Spirit provided $ 50 million a year .	-3.0992
Sorensen , who had a leadership position at Midvest Airlines earlier , has recently flown with spirit and was curious what would expect him on the flight if passengers faced the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-4.4117
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I had experienced in my career in the aviation , ” he said .	-3.0174
I expected to see teeth ceremonies and hand-reaching discussions at the flight .	-3.7065
“ The aircraft was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-2.4869
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.2459
The company explained that passengers who bought limonades or juice that would retain all the doses and fill in coffee for free .	-4.0193
Water is still free .	-1.2038
US Airways attempted to demand money for refreshment beverages in 2008 , but seven months later reversed after passengers had complained and no other great society was drawn up .	-4.0741
Frontier ’ s step to charge charges for hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-4.0194
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz $ 10 to 25 per sold ticket .	-3.0057
This provides an incentive for all companies to move passengers for direct purchase instead of over an online travel agency .	-3.1790
Frontier has , however , gone the most far in this area .	-3.0026
In September , the company started to award only half so many flyer miles when booking an online travel agency .	-3.3606
On Wednesday , miles were reduced to 25 percent of the flight route .	-2.5927
A flight travel booked with a third party provider with over 1000 miles is therefore only 250 miles .	-3.8954
Passengers can also book spaces exclusively when direct purchase on the Frontier website .	-2.7440
Frontier has a faithful customer base at his headquarters in Denver , but the business shrinks and the company loses m                       	-3.4291

Theme of the day in the community house were " sayings from the Bible " and " speech turns from the Middle Ages " .	-3.3832
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the Church Community Council , was introduced after breakfast in a presentation on the Biblical sayings .	-3.8681
" Sayings contain wisdom of life , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-2.7332
It compared several sayings with the corresponding bible offices and explained the meaning .	-2.9344
She called sayings like : wooden eyes are vigilant , how scoups fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives His gift 's the Lord in sleep , wash his hands innocent .	-4.4268

Learning Rather than Unemployed : Pilot Project for Unskilled In Tourism	-2.6200
A pilot project for the tourism industry is starting at the Mecklenburgische Lake Platte .	-3.3413
Under the leadership of the Federal Working Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled in the industry are qualified to professionals for hotels and restaurants over three winters .	-3.9823
" New is that the six-month courses end with conclusions " , said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg Agency .	-2.8166
The benefit is varied : participants would not be unemployed , companies get trained specialists who lacked more and more in hotels and restaurants , and the agency does not need to finance unemployment .	-4.3663
The project also participates in the industrial and commercial chamber in Neubrandenburg as well as the Deutsche Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-3.3599
NSA explains that an “ internal mistake , ” not hacker , is blamed at the crash of the website	-3.0320
The shadowy National Security Agency explained late Friday , a mistake has paralyzed its public website some hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-3.6677
“ NSA.gov was not accessible for some hours this night because , during a planned update , an internal error has occurred , ” the spy agency explained in a message sent by e-mail .	-3.9905
The problem will be fixed on this evening .	-1.7780
The claim that the default has been caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDOS ) is not true .	-2.6489
In the early hours of evening , online server trackers had noticed that the NSA website had not been achievable for at least six hours and this is still not available for some users .	-4.0930
Previously , a NSA spokesman explained to ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the authority is “ in no way ” compromised .	-2.9363
Secret information is not in danger , so the speaker .	-1.8894
At least one group of hacktivists used to paralyze the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.2763
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the website breaks collapse .	-3.8401
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to intrude into the internal network of the target system .	-2.9249
The earlier super-secret NSA , whose top name once No Such Agency ( no such authority ) , has become in the bright light of the public and has been exposed to the revelations known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program in home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-5.0178
The growing controversy about the intelligence service fueled initial speculations about the incident today 's result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-3.3825
The number of people without job in October has fallen by 22 to 1,307 .	-3.9090

Bombing Bombing Falls in Delivery Numbers	-3.3241
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in net profits on Thursday , after having been under pressure through declining orders and deliveries in aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the rail p    p .	-4.1935
Bombardier with headquarters in Montreal also published no air test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and granted no new information about whether the aircraft can go into commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-4.0375
On the test aircraft ’ s jungflight one and a half months ago , only three other starts followed , which makes it questionable whether the test phase runs as planned .	-4.3404
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a crash of more than 8 % of the Toronto stock exchange .	-4.6118
Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , reduced its assessment of “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” on Thursday that the share has a limited course potential in the next one to two quart     .                           	-3.6589
“ Weaker delivery numbers have been expected far from aircraft , but we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport area , ” said Doerksen in a customer writing .	-4.3358
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the test program is moving forward for the aircraft .	-2.9032
But if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical to the program .	-3.7888
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.6076
The first test aircraft was presented in March of the public and flew for the first time in September following mon            m          	-3.2868
But up to now , binding orders for the CSeries are moderate with 177 , as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the claims of the company are accurate in terms of fuel efficiency and cost-savings of the new nozzle aircraft .	-5.3007
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments of 15 customers and companies .	-2.3278
Chairman of the Board of Board Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve its goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-3.2619
Corporate management assured the program on Thursday to analysts and media analysts , and  the programme is i th tim p .	-5.3571
“ The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the aircraft ’ s leading tests and software updates were set up .	-4.1478
Each manufacturer plans different .	-1.6436
We have decided to take a first flight and then append a revision period , which we have done .	-2.5268
This happens throughout the flight programme .	-1.9525
The second of five test aircraft will likely be launching in the coming weeks , the remaining briefly afterwards , said it from business side .	-3.7363
However , analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the first customer 's jungflight can operate an aircraft from the CSeries .	-3.4291
Bombardier explained that it checked the planning for the commissioning ( EIS ) and will update them in the coming months .	-2.7386
“ The slow advances of flight testing – although obviously Bombardier ’ s internal planning – strengthens our view that commissioning to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-4.0258
In the third quarter with the end of September , Bombardier ’ s net gain fell to $ 147 million and 8 cents per share of $ 172 million and 9 cents per share prior to the yea          each  y              .	-4.3475

The order book in the aerospace parts was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September , which was unchanged to December 31 .	-3.1776
“ The results were disappointing ” in the aerospace and space sector , but the low order intake and the market relationships as a whole were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-3.8321
Sales in the aerospace parts fell by $ 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.6444
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this saving have risen by just 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-2.9508
The order book in the transport savings was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , and was easily increased to December 31 .	-9.0314

The Lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light	-2.8257
He was condemned by the Liverpooler Crown Court for three years imprisonment	-2.2041
A well-known criminal defender , warning a drug baron against a large police investigation , because he had fear that his secret drug addiction could be revealed , was condemned to three years .	-3.4956
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about investigations on their activities in drug trafficking after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-3.6567
The lawyer with the top name “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 by criminalists as “ first-class ” after the police Scarborough , which he represented in a previous drug procedure .	-4.2787
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three buttles of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while they were with colleagues in a food of the lawyer ’ s chamber .	-4.4998

Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to procure information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.8068
All four suspects were monitored by the police within the framework of a major investigation procedure for heroin and cocaine trading in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.1030
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later after the police ensured a series of heroin and cocaine in the value of 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash .	-3.2803
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction can become public .	-2.3490
Today , Ditta , who works for the Forbes Solicitors firm in Blackburn , was found and condemned at the Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week procedure in two charges for disabling justice .	-4.1985
In the earlier survey , he agreed to cocaine .	-3.4665
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in its investigations against Scarborough that in February 2011 this was in regular telephone contact with Ditta .	-3.7400
Two investigation officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas House and there put drugs with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove under the waste tonnes of the lawyer .	-4.0741
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs , telephoned Scarborough regularly with Ditta , who was in the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .	-4.1517
The lawyer returned home , and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-2.5976
It was known before the court that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after tests drugs of class A were discovered in his hair , his wallet and on his credit cards .	-4.0832
Ditta was arrested later , but contested to take cocaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because this was his claim , and claimed that her discussion was subject to the “ lawyer secret . ”	-4.1686
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a series of credit cards , but they were ensured and a hair test was taken .	-2.9026
In the police interrogation , he assumed that he would operate an office and clients at home for legal affairs , both under his private address and at work  .   H                          wou   	-8.0887
It was known before the court that he called for important players in the drug trafficking that he had represented some previously , and had informed about what the investigators knew about them .	-4.1622
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that we do not break the law . ”	-2.7280
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has engaged too much with certain clients .	-3.6384
The relationship in question is not simply a drug trafficker , but a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-2.9532
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-2.7831
But that was far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and mandant .	-2.3533
He worked as far as possible to counter police investigations so that they could continue to follow their criminal activit .     Th C w w  t             	-5.2655
Mr Ditta therefore brought his profession into practice .	-3.3041
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.4013
Ditta pointed out every misconduct of himself and claimed : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , what I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , then I would wait no 15 hours , but do that immediately . ”	-4.2824
But , after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to purchase drugs from organised criminals . ”	-3.4595
His cocaine dependence led to hopeless compromisation and made him sensitive to the motives of leading members of organised crime that commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations                               o        t  .     	-4.9468
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public .	-2.2388
Ditta has gone behind this confidence and tried to take action behind the facade of his profession .	-3.5713
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire headed the investigations against Ditta , which also led to a condemnation in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and judicial obstacles , underlining our determination to bring criminals to court .	-3.6894
This case should be a warning for criminals and shows that none of them can escape the arm of the law .	-3.2292
We find you and bring you to court .	-2.4187
Scarborough himself was condemned to 14 years of prison after guilty of the conspiracy to heroin , cocaine and cannabis .	-3.4730
Thirty-five other people involved in drug trafficking were condemned for the total penalty of 153 years for drug licts .	-3.6842
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he specified that his dream job was to represent as lawyer mandants in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest when dinner is Mohammed Ali and equal opportunities is the motivation for his work .	-4.6410
Revolutionary Plant of Church Music	-1.6561
In order to conclude the celebrations from the occasion of its 160-year-old existence , the songs of Dunningen will frame two god services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.7220
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which the spectators enthusiasts in spring this year , the song cranch will enrich two God services with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert .	-4.1223

The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Vocals to the Celebration of the Sacred Victim of the Fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work of the composer Franz Schubert dating from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of e           co .	-4.7934
The exhibition is listed in the context of God 's services , as the customer Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind  .	-3.2384
Under the leadership of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the blower group of the Frohsinn Tennbronn and Noemi Lokodi organ .	-3.2358
Haslach : Scepticism of confidence	-2.3310
With the 2015 elections to the Council of Parishes , for example , the Sea Organization Unit Haslach ( SE ) will change fundamentally .	-3.4407
Then there is only a common council of parish for all six parishes .	-3.1138
At a common meeting , the bodies from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschensteinach prepared themselves for the changes on Saturday .	-3.3997
Because there is nothing more to change the basic decisions of the diocese and it is on the parish councils to implement them as satisfactory as possible .	-3.9832
Over the day , it has become particularly clear : the scepticism towards the new softly hesitant but a confidence .	-4.6647
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on future composition and the size of the Council of Parishes , the extremely constructive talks of the six bodies with the main officials of the sea organisation team .	-4.0266
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained by a presentation the newly adopted Seelsorge Units Directives in the Archdiocese Freiburg .	-3.5852
Afterwards , the SE Haslach , as a community of churches , is a corporation of public law that enters the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities so far .	-4.1533
There will only be a common council of parish and a council of foundations where the parish force is represented b o o office .	-4.0213
Every parish should be represented at least two elected members , in the six parishes so-called community teams will be formed on the ground .	-3.4812
Their task will be to promote the real life in the place in the future .	-2.7568
In the question of the finances of the individual parish community , significant discussions were needed .	-3.7381
The innovations provide that accumulated credit remains used in parishes .	-3.3295
The liabilities are opposed to the overall community .	-2.5594
There was great concern , particularly with regard to the major planned investments whose commitment then meeted all parishes .	-3.7635
" Even in the past , only invested in projects that could be managed by individual parishes alone " , relative Haslach ’ s parish community chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-3.9320
Practical experience with a common board for five parishes , Barbar Ritter , the chairman of the body in the Seelsorge Unit Schutterwald-Neuried .	-3.5343
They had done their job in 2006 , ' One will stay , five ' and had to say that that is not so easy .	-4.5655
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorge Unit then answered questions about the future composition and size of the common council of parish and the practical work of the community teams .	-3.6519
The preparations are concretised at further meetings and adopted at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-3.5892
At the end of the parish council , Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the sea organization unit , which has been approved by a clear majority .	-3.8377
In Pfullendorf , Electricity is becom more expensive .	-2.9221
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-2.3873
As the Managing Director of the City Works , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed by the SUDKURIER , a four-personal pulled village of family 70 to 90 euros costs per year .	-4.5929
The increase in the so-called EEC surroundings from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour is essential reason for the forthcoming price increas            .	-3.4212
This surrounding is reset every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity routes .	-3.0812
These are the more costs created from the energy turn , which they can charge through an electricity price su p .	-4.6852
The city works of Pfullendorf are the last link in this chain .	-2.3306
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company has even started in its forecasts as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-3.4792
Now the concrete payments should be calculated before city works could inform their customers about the precise increase next week .	-3.4274
" We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x , " said bias , where the number will be near the 2 cent .	-4.5128
Lamps on Durable Red : Take care of waiting	-3.0148
Sometimes a traffic light will simply not be green .	-2.1879
The contact loop in the street does not respond , or the light character is defe .	-2.6818
What should you do - go to Red ?	-3.1348
Has waited a long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free , it can continue , explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-3.8967
However , the waiting time must be " appropriate " , which can be designed from case to c .    T                	-3.6090
Becker advises to harness at least five minutes before the functional disruption of the traffic lights is to be dealt with .	-4.7305
However , anyone who continues the trip despite Red Light must be aware that he is fully blamed for an accident caused by this .	-3.9817
Anyone who is tolerating less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Oberland Court of Hamm .	-3.4431
In the negotiated case , after about three minutes of duration , a driver ignored the light and had to respond to a negligent red light .	-4.0764
The traffic was not defective , but little later reversed on green .	-3.2148
A ban on driving remained spared because of the special situation - but fines did not .	-3.6083
The Council of Municipalities	-1.9241
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal advice , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-3.0574
The community sack in Herdwangen-Schönach has been well filled and debt has no longer been able to administer the administration since 20 . It   i   th   	-5.1330
The 2012 financial year can also be booked in this sense as a full succe .	-2.7468
This has been clear in the notion of the accounts for 2012 .	-2.7943
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget , with around EUR 7.6 million , has been higher than planned for over E   million .	-3.8761
The surplus of the administrative budget , too , is about EUR 1.8 million , about EUR 1 million above the approach .	-3.4997
Thanks to the surplus , especially higher tax revenue and the community share of income tax .	-12.5452
The asset budget was again clearly about the planned values .	-2.7449
Rather than EUR 1.5 million , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-2.6444
" This is essentially on the higher introduction from the administrative budget , " said Rothmund .	-3.0978
Since fiscal year 2012 less investment has been planned , the introduction of reserves has also been higher .	-3.4558
Overall , the general reserve has been able to increase by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 millio  . T i i s   	-4.1198
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work .	-1.8833
" Such a work is not shaken easy from the sleeve " , praised Gerster with a view to the annual bill .	-3.8020
He and the councils were pleased about the good numbers .	-2.7537
It may sound paradoxical , but precisely these good figures could cost citizens expensively soon .	-2.8915
Through the good financial situation , the community has been able to renounce high levies in the past .	-3.3006
In turn , however , according to the Gerster , subsidies have often been reduced by the country .      T 'P was the   	-7.8407
There are conditions for these subsidies from various compensatory balances .	-2.8708
Among other things , cities and communities requesting subsidies must provide certain levies .	-2.8569
" We need to look at the issue of levies , because investments in the years to come are , for which we would like to have subsidies " , announced Gerster in this context .	-4.5566

Kenyan Press is disturbing controversial media laws	-2.9603
“ We are in a frightening situation and we must ask ourselves : what does Parliament think of simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ” , was in the newspaper which considers the draft legislation to be unconstitutional .	-4.3941
“ The law is draconian and very punishable , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , managing director of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of the most prestigious independent radiostations and news sites in Kenya .	-3.6233
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be prejudiced , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.0866
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.6481

The adoption of the law is a series of measures to strengthen national security following attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate shopping centre in September .	-3.1162
The Kenyan media pulled the anger of the authorities into themselves because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units posted at the location supposedly predicted the luxury shopping centre .	-4.4308

Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .	-2.5469
As airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport follows throughput affecting individuals , an international trend .	-3.5247
Among other things , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already renouncing the poor calls .	-3.6474
Through the disappearance of these throughputs - average on average , about 200 personal calls through the speakers - it should be more quiet at the airport in the future .	-4.9788

According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling of experiencing or seeing a new situation .	-3.5965
In the event of the visit of the same named café on the Opschlag in the circle city of Kleve , in the view of the Rhine-Waal university , it does not have to remain a pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-5.3560
Finally , with the beautiful name of this , the café has the objective of making an actual stay not only thankful , but rather always experience a recurring experience .	-5.2874
Because 's even fun and simply beautiful .	-2.6148
A glance in the inner life on Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good sense   . T '                	-4.1999
The state-of-the-art but not cool café ambience looks like a place for well-being .	-2.7735

UN proclaims new objectives in combating poverty	-6.1524
The United Nations immediately starts to draw up a number of new objectives with which the Millennium Development Goals announced to combat poverty should be replace  t                           t .	-3.3919
In the run-up to the UN Summit for Sustainable Development , which began in Rio de Janeiro , Australia ’ s diplomats played a key role in encouraging “ sustainable development targets , ” which would replace the Millennium Goals in 2015 .	-3.9689
They have been included in the final draft document adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-3.2540
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared at the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-2.5832
“ I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to tackle a process that should be agreed with universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.2166
“ These goals will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the framework for the development after 2015 .	-6.0534

Even if the SG Achim / Baden has been winning for four days , the Handball Oberligist remains good mood .	-3.5970
There is no doubt about Trainer Tomasz Malmon .	-2.0253
Everyone remains fully motivated on the matter  .   The s is th mo . T	-4.7146
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally gain agai          .	-2.3065
" Because I don 't know any more how such a victory " , Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-3.7084
Even if the third level reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet trees out , Malmon warns the finger in the run-up to the point finger .	-4.2977
I myself trained many players in the A-Youth .	-3.5240
For this reason , they will certainly be particularly motivated against thei    e  coach .	-2.6626
" Moreover , we must wait for the first time to see whether the SG-Coach is still reinforced       .     "        sh is c  c  .  	-7.1650

Security concerns in Mozambique grow in the face of collisions between influential personalities	-2.7838
Thousands of people gathered under the vigilant eyes of the Samora Machel Statue , the founder of the state and first President Mozambique to vote in favour of a rare public demonstration .	-3.4646
“ We want peace , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , managing director of an investment company .	-2.3124
In fear of the country ’ s future , it has exchanged its business clothing against a T-shirt with the label “ We ask for security ” to Portuguese and connected to Thursday the quantity of the capital ’ s independence place                           	-4.7653
For two weeks nearly daily there have been reports on collisions between government forces and Renamo , which have been one of the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.4262
Renamo was once an infamous rebel movement , which initially supported by the Rhodesians governed by White , and later the apartheit government of South Africa , in trying to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.8989
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.9776
Analysts believe it is unlikely that the country has returned to an increased conflict , but recent events have concerned foreign investors and locals .	-3.0505
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because discovering huge gas reserves before the coast and coal bearings in the northwest could bring investments of more than $ 50 billion in companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko f the US  .	-4.2057
The governing Frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo has blamed each other for tensions .	-2.7869
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent collisions by attacking its members in the Sofala province , a traditional highbourg Renamos , on 17 October .	-3.1065
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , explained Renamos Speaker to the Financial Times .	-3.2590
The government is blaming Renamo for collapses , accusing the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.9370
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downgrade concerns about instability .	-1.6239
Towards AFP , the French News Agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered “ losers ” that “ wants to use all his forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-3.9063
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.8308
However , the concerns have increased since Mazanga have been quoted in the words that Renamo raises the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.2811
He explained to the FT , so he meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement .	-3.0653
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations and seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-2.3129
Previous discussions between the parties have contributed little to resolving tensions fueled by a number of collisions this year .	-4.0093
“ We have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) , who meet the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , dozen at the Open University and Mozambique experts .	-3.3591
None of them is good in negotiations and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.4639
Renamo , which urges electoral reforms , has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.4761
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.4554
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as the attempt by a sick movement to get concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.9670
Renamo ’ s electoral success since 1992 , while a newer party , probably improved by a former Renamo member , will probably improve Movimento Democrático de Moçambique ( MDM ) .	-3.5234
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is if his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’   s  d   d ’ é .	-2.7497
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace , because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” said Mazanga .	-3.1052
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection .	-3.1993
Most of the fights took place in the province of Sofala , which is some hundred kilometres north of Maputo , where Beira is located , use the port , mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-3.8664
In June , Rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-2.7203
Mazanga responded to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat  .	-2.3716
Renamo wanted “ the international community to warn that things in Mozambique are not good , ” said Mazanga .	-2.7201
Instability has increased the frustration of the government , says Fernando Lima , Mediacoop Head , an independent media company , because many people have already concerned about corruption , sluggish progress in development and recent kidnapping .	-4.3928
“ People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country , and he should be responsible for those who find solutions to the problems ” ,  he says .	-3.0176
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people just wanted stability .	-1.8483
“ No interest Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-2.7882
Children should get myths and legends as “ models for life , ” believes an author .   T ' s i  a   s      	-5.2269
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legends demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.4952
However , many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools , ” which is why Crossley-Holland pleaded for a “ careful selection ” of age-right works .	-3.6490
“ I find it wonderful that America ’ s myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-2.3405
I have been proposing that for twenty years as a plan .	-2.5430
He added that , in authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic ” , children would “ shut off ” completely , because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ under-swelling . ”	-4.1783
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from the Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , explained : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-3.6084
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to give hope .	-2.8546
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.3167
This must be understood , revealed by history and not explained .	-3.0180
This is the old story of the show instead of narratives .	-2.5117

With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the Stork Day Children with their loud " Heraus , Heraus " .	-3.5096
His criticism of the Church of Office expressed Hansjakob at that time as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialisation or the effects of war .	-4.3429
In the home town , behind his tomb on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his retirement si     .          	-8.3031

Court blocks decision on the NYPD Stop and Frisk Directive .	-2.1928
On Thursday , a Federal Appeal Court in the United States blocked the arrangement of a judge calling for changes to the Stop-and-Frisk program ( “ Searching and browsing ” ) of the New York police department , and dismantled the judge of the case .	-4.4499
The 2nd US Appeal Court explained that judge Shira Scheindlin would be exposed to an appeal to the city .	-3.1280
The judge judged in August that the city violated the Constitution with the way in which the programme for the continuity and questions of persons is implemented .	-3.6769

The Appeal Court listened to the arguments required on Tuesday .	-2.3762
The appeal report stated that the judge must be dismantled by the case , because they have violated the code of conduct for US judges by avoiding the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the criticism of the court                                                      	-5.7662

In 2004 , four men who belonged to all minorities submitted complaints that developed into a collective collection .	-4.4951
Advocates of changes to the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Programme , the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police and influence the way in which other police presidencies use the regulation .	-3.9516
Opponents believe that changes would absorb the morality of the police , but not crime ; it would also waste money and not solve the broader problem of a police under pressure after the disappearance of thousands of posts over the past decade .	-4.3447
The judge pointed out that they do not end the stop-and-frisk practice that is constitutional , but only reform the kind of implementation of controls by NYPD .	-3.3308

Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of Pawlby .	-2.4339
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow about which I would like to speak to Charles . ”	-3.2119

Around 80 participants have come to the community hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , concerns and introduce ideas .	-3.4838
Householders clearly said : ' The ultimate decisions are the members of the Community Council ' .	-3.3760
The flood water unprepared on 15 May 2009 was a strong event that raised the question of protection measures for the future , such as householders .	-3.8364
A river territory investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring community Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in s  .	-3.6288
" The protection of as many constructed plots is the goal " , so householders .	-3.4385

Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent sup .	-2.2293
This is called " HQ 100aKlima " in specialists .	-2.4281
The water masses that had led to considerable damage in 2009 corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood  .	-3.0528
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " said householders .	-2.8101
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima , around four million euros must be invested , with the community capable of expecting approximately EUR 70 percent .	-4.3520
However , householders pointed out that there is only promotion if an overall concept is implemented .	-3.2703
To this end , the community needs to participate in citizens .	-4.2423
A complete planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-1.8760
In the best case , the implementation can begin in 2016 .	-2.1554
Among other things , the protection concept , which has already been presented last week in the Council of Municipal Council ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the field of river Irm from the Home Valley .	-3.8506

The problem is known in the administration and the first measures have already been taken .	-2.5824
However , householders pointed out that the channel systems directives must not be mixed for flood protection and that must not be mixed .	-4.0064
The community is obliged to interpret the Canal Network in such a way that two to three years of rain events could be powered .	-2.9921

CDC published allergy guidelines for schools	-1.6380
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a number of directives for the deal with food allergies of children in schools .	-2.9094
These are the first such directives that the American Government has published , as the number of food allergies is increasing .	-3.3317
One of 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.7357
The dissemination of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % , according to CDCs between 1997 and 2007 .	-3.3258
The guidelines contain information for schools , which should provide awareness of food allergies and how to handle children who show allergic reactions .	-4.0347
It is also recommended that schools have presented Epinephrin – the car injection of the EpiPen brand is most commonly used – to meet a potentially lethal sensitivity response .	-3.6218
The legislators in the federal states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more precise .	-3.5767
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic response .	-2.2715
Children may say : “ It feels as if something pushes on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels as if a hair lies on it ” or “ cribbles my tongue . ”	-4.1326
Parents of intersexual children can “ Gender Undetermined ”	-2.1222
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with non-clear genitals .	-2.5028
Newborn is no longer allocated rigidly male or female .	-2.1698
According to the new law , parents must no longer explain a gender for such children , but can specify “ undetermined ” or “ not defined ” on the birth customer .	-4.1033
The objective of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to take overall decisions regarding operations for allocating newborns , and to combat the discrimination against intersexual people .	-4.1051
An intersexual person said according to BBC years later : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-1.9571
I remain the panel created by doctors mutilated and full of scars .	-2.4712
It is estimated that one of 2,000 children every year comes neither as a boy nor as girls to the world .	-3.7799
They belong to the intersexuals , a group that fall under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collection for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( eggs or hods ) or unusually developed genitals .	-3.6231
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.3929
Understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the United States advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible , rather than waiting for the psychological and physical development of the child before , if anything , operation is decided .	-4.2032
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in the problem of gender identification , said the new German law “ sound after a good thing . ”	-2.8215
Intersexual children constitute an ethical dilemma .	-3.5988
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not apply , ” he said .	-2.7058
We can make a gender allocation without operation and wait for the identity to develop .	-3.1068
Scientific data about how a child develops its gender identity at all are not very careful .	-2.2829
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.3337
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.9214
A report to the European Commission from 2011 states that intersexual people are distinguished by transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender-based but by their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically defines both simultaneously or not clearly as one of them .	-4.0855
These properties showed themselves in substantial sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals or in chromosome structures and hormones .	-3.6340
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination which faces intersexual and transgender persons in professional life and on the scale of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .	-3.4364
Not with the gender image have a special camp now .	-2.8168
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to indicate male , female or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.8252
In June , Australian Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person after a court had acknowledged the lifelong maintenance of a “ non-defined ” gender status .	-3.7692
In addition to M and W , German cards have a third allocation , X for intersexual , so the Interior Ministry .	-2.7326
In neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , such a news report on France 24 .	-3.0210
In 2011 , dozens of French Members of the strict Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from schoolbooks .	-2.6099
The US Catholic Online website has also spoken against German law , with the justification : “ If the world is dragged into a new state where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we turn two other pillars of civilization . ”	-3.8812
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone , they would find it better if babies assigned to birth a gender .	-3.3391
“ The parental is already stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you do not know the gender of your own child , ” she said the parent website .	-3.8995
Children need stability and security .	-0.9514
Historically , children who were born with male and female sexual parts were called hermaphrodites , after the attractive Greek God that both sexes had .	-3.1734
Ten years ago , medicine viewed the sex as something that can be deleted and then rebuild .	-3.0798
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now doubted after how complex sexual identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong , because they do not know how the child feels in growing with the gender they allocate .	-5.1986
“ In the mid-twentieth century , one called this one , psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher  .              	-3.2934
If such a child was born , then you called not the psychiatrist but the surgeons .	-2.7919
The ruling theory of the treatment of children with non-clear genitals returns to Dr. John Money from the Johns Hopkins University , who represented the view that gender is formable .	-3.4186
He characterized the concept of “ gender identity ” and argued , social and environmental impacts – such as parents educate a child – interacted with genes and hormones of a child and shaped whether a person considered male or female .	-4.2277
But his theories became controversial in a case known as the John / Joan title .	-2.9029
He revealed the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a made circumcision to castrate the child and also to remove his hods , and then give him girls .	-5.1112
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion , but he was not , ” said Drescher .	-2.7323
When the boy was about 15 , he changed back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.2685
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-1.8081
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.1299
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the Internet , survivors of these gender operations have come to the public that “ are not happy with the result . ”	-3.3055
For example , at Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.5657
Doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-3.0344
So his external body and the Hoden were surgically removed shortly after the 1976 birth , and he was girlfriend .	-3.7367
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.7647
“ I knew I 'm not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com	-2.1210
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.6995
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-1.6974
But as he was depressive and knew that something was not true , he demanded his medical acts .	-2.5756
What he found out was shocking .	-1.1486
I have been sterilized with my birth – and nobody has ever told me th      .	-2.5771
Bruce was born with a DSD that did not produce his body enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-2.7606
After having known the truth , he received the male identity , received Testosteron injections and could remove his breasts .	-3.7971
The operation has become infertile .	-1.7528
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people being perceived as normal .	-2.8047
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , managing director of the Advocates for Informed Choice legal group in California , ensures that German law can encourage “ to stamp and stigmatize ” .	-3.1996
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to take quick decisions and to allow the child , not set , ” she explained .	-3.7513
We are afraid of intervention .	-2.0934
We think it would be better to allocate male or female gender and then wait for the sex .	-2.7968
But we do not know how the law will have , so we can only speculate .	-2.0911
Tamar-Mattis said that its organization support Australian law , because “ adults make it possible to recognise the third sex . ”	-3.1892
“ Adults should be able to make own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.2650
German law is about the allocation of the birth  .	-2.4081
This is not a battle at which you should force young children at this time  .	-2.8666
If they are adults , they can decide on their own bodies .	-3.3853
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a brustradiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says German law “ authorised ” both parents and children .	-3.1856
Share , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called androgen resistance .	-3.7738
Female characteristics due to the recipe of the Testosteron target cells .	-2.9670
It has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-2.0456
Today , Catie 29 and married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in child psychiatry .	-2.6034
Although it is infertile , it hopes to be able to get a child by adoption or surrender .	-3.4767
“ The law gives parents space , which means that they do not have to make decisions ” , said Baratz .	-2.7320
They give them the time to make different tests and clarify things and give them so time before they write “ male ” or “ female . ”	-3.1203
In this way , everything is fine – you love the child and love it .	-3.1685
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness .	-2.1562
And we do not have to make an operation that can no longer be reversed .	-2.9056
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that runs parents because they believe that they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-3.3638
Ultimately , the child decides on gender that fits better to him – and that is wonderful .	-2.7393
This enables children to make the decision themselves .	-1.7177

Until now , the police inspection can look back at a quiet Halloween night .	-2.6297
Officials have only been called twice to accuse children who throw them against house facades .	-3.5308
Because the home owners recognized this in good time and the eggs removed equally removed , no damage was caused .	-4.8786
There were also some sylvester bollers in the city area , but there was no damage to this .	-4.1927
A resident in the Bishop-Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was invested with clopaper and his wheels were developed .	-4.5319

Living with the Future	-1.9130
In fact , Waltraud Ries is dreaming .	-2.4366
Its house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree stock , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.2439
It is only a few minutes away from public transport .	-2.5014
" You hopefully don 't have any fear of spiders ? " , Waltraud Ries asks and shows a fat spider on the door frame .	-4.0576
I have been looking for a new apartment for my man and myself for some time .	-2.0286
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.6396
The reason , however , is not a phobia of spiders , but the concern that age no longer be able to cope with the many staircases at the house and in the apa .	-4.8313
Furthermore , since a meniscus operation , the central fifty-fifth have had to learn their own body , which means moving with Handicap from floor to floor .	-4.4999
Recently , a book of her appeared on the theme ' Happy Live in Age - What shape is the best for me ? ' .	-4.0549
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not go at all ' begins to tell it .	-2.7975
When she moved to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-2.9998
Today , in the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it .	-2.2935
However , it also knows that it is one of the few people who are dealing with the theme of ' living in age ' .	-3.6676
Most of the pressure is , as long as it is all about .	-3.4959
Old are always only the others , she says smiling .	-2.1749
Only when the pressure of suffering is really large , thoughts are given .	-4.0380
'Then it can also be too late ' , so Ries .	-2.1522
In her book , the interior architect presents 17 living models for a self-determined living in the age .	-3.1815
'What shape you choose is always an individual decision ' , explains it .	-2.7879

Even not like in a student WG with a common bath and a kitchen .	-3.4684
'At age you simply need his retreat rooms ' , say Ries .	-3.3909
However , that a senior housing community can work , the book author does not want to exclude .	-3.1026
However , this will have to be different from the classic student tr .	-3.3179
And sometimes you just want to believe his quietness '  .	-3.0943
This does not mean that it is at least in the capital .	-4.6120
'The majority of old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment ' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of citizens ' service life at the age of the capital .	-3.7543
Their service advises people around the topic of becoming older .	-2.7842
That is why elderly people would often also buy inconvenience and restrictions , only to remain in their usual environment , it is also the experience of the Foundation 's Foundation of Goods .	-3.9458
Today there are many ways of designing the house or apartment barrier-free .	-2.9841
Ries recommends all those who deal with the age-right reconstruction of their house or apartment only to inform thoroughly and not to contract the first craftsmen .	-6.0297
Today , there are also specialists for age-right reconstruction .	-3.8432
Even in the rental apartment this can be realized one or another , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architect clarifies .	-4.1396
But not always the existing apartment can be transformed age-right , even if it is still so beautiful .	-3.5593
This experience had to do Waltraud Ries .	-1.5713
Although you could install a staircase lift within the apartment , which would also be paved with stairways until the housing door would be far greater obstacles .	-5.9249

The US has not changed its attitude to the former US intelligence secretary Edward Snowden .	-2.4083
He will continue to be accused of having passed on unauthorized information .	-4.0221
He must therefore commit himself to a criminal proceeding in the United States , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-3.5735
The recent statements by Snowden would also not change the     .	-2.9568
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US not to threaten him with punishment .	-3.1528
Psaki emphasized that Ströbel 's statements are the ones of a parliamentarian , not that of a German government .	-4.2765
Intelligence service thuller Edward Snowden is prepared in principle for a discussion with German authorities .	-2.9425
First , however , he wants to know his situation .	-2.3602
This has made it clear to the former NSA employee in an unaddressed letter that the Green Politician Hans-Christian Ströbele published on Friday following a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to Federal Government , Bundestag and General Bundesanwalt .	-4.0565
The letter has the following wording following a translation sp b Ströbele :   t .	-3.2795

I have been asked to write you on your investigation on mass monitoring .	-2.9357
I hot Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or about a direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-3.2578
In the course of my employment in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of my government , which led me to act from a moral duty .	-3.4719
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was subject to a serious and ongoing heat that forced me to leave my family and my homeland .	-3.4919
I am currently living in exile and enjoying temporary asylum that grants me the Russian Federation under international law .	-3.5131
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-1.8064
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations on a system of global surveillance that nobody is accountable as a service to the public .	-3.5990
These spying revelations included many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the formerly covered abuse of public confidence .	-3.1702
The benefits for society from these gained findings are becoming increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks taken in purchasing have been reduced visibly .	-3.8576
Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government still treats dissent as a faithful breakthrough and seeks to criminalise and charge political expression .	-3.7285
Nevertheless , the truth to be expressed is no          c   	-2.6959
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will have this detrimental attitude .	-2.8946
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate in the responsible information of the issues made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports , appropriate and legi .	-3.9903
I look forward to a discussion with you in your country as soon as the situation is clarified and thank you for their efforts to maintain the international law we all protect .	-3.1448

Report : Obama campaign considered replacing bids with Hillary Clinton	-1.6631
The closest advisers of President Barack Obama have considered secretly to replace Vice-President Joe Biden in the 2012 election campaign with Hillary Clinton , the New York Times .	-3.0191
The revelation is the most considerable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .     T ’ s  a s  f ’ s 	-5.1605
The Times is a copy of the shortly appearing book and it reported on Thursday night that the President-in-Office ’ s topbox had carried out “ extensive group sessions and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether there is better hope for Obama ’ s diminishing hope for re-election when he leaves bids f . I  h wo h t b t s . ” T . I  T w w w s a s	-9.6793
According to Jonathan Martin , Times ’ national correspondent , the book is carefully drawing the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House to measure , namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , the effect that it has on the surveys values to exchange former Secretary of State Clinton against the Vice-President .	-4.4914
The potential change was a strictly prestigious secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office .	-2.7163
Only half a dozen of the closest advisers of the President – including Daley , the former campaign leader Obama , Jim Messina , and the former leading adviser of the White House , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the intended change .	-3.5410
Double Down claims that Daley has been at the top of efforts to exchange bids , despite their “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before you decided to choose such movement after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would “ not improve Obama ’ s opportunities . ”	-5.0745
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government had actually considered replacing bids by Clinton .	-3.1749
“ I expressed a whole series of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” said Daley to the magazine .	-3.1409
It must be remembered that the President had terrible surveys at that time , so we thought : “ To God ’ s will , what do we ? ”	-3.6017
While Daley referred to the investigations as “ offered care , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper by CNN that , during the campaign for re-election , significant efforts had been operated to find out whether such a train pays for the ballot box .	-4.4475
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you do not think seriously about something , ” Martin explained to AC360 .	-3.2533
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team thought about exchange .	-2.1311
Martin said to CNN , he asked Daley whether his then boss knew about the potential change .	-2.4526
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the President was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff acknowledged that it was “ possible ,      t O h knew . ”	-3.8781
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political specifications had reached desk .	-3.6291
Cooper asked Martin whether he thinks seriously , Obama did not know about the investigations about whether to fall bids in the elections .	-3.4109
“ Possible ” , Martin revived .	-1.9869
What happens on the way with my e-mail ?	-1.8343
E-mail actually means electronic letter .	-1.9707
Was the same as the conventional post technically implemented the letter secret when drafting the Internet service ?	-3.4046
In the concept of early Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-2.8791
Therefore , the fundamental technical protocols have not been established to create a stable foundation for a more safe letter .	-5.4289
Therefore , a conventional e-mail is more open than a sealed letter .	-4.0874
When user " Anna " to " Benni " sends one email , are the computers of the two directly connected t ?	-3.2679
The e-mail program or browser of Anna sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step .	-2.8795
For example , if it has a GMail account , the Google would be .	-2.0677
This mail server sends the content to the provider using Benni .	-1.6906
On the route you can run the mail via several other servers on the Internet .	-3.3364
Bennie can then call the content in its provider .	-2.1266
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the network ?	-1.9886
Most mails are read on multiple times by software robots .	-2.2916
At the provider of the sender , it is usually checked whether the mail will lead a damage program as an attachment                	-4.2990
A virus check is also made on the receiver syste        . It    is c                	-5.8674
Furthermore , the providers check whether this is an annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or at least sorted into a spam folder .	-3.9687
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.4629
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information that Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.5391
When Anna and Benni communicate by GMail about their forthcoming holiday trips , Google can start links to holiday offers .	-3.9668
Are unknown people reading the e-mails with ?	-2.9154
The probability that unauthorized persons read a mail is extremely low .	-2.2910
Theoretically , however , is possible .	-1.8452
In companies often administrators have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.1508
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to start or note emails .	-3.5959
This includes possible illegal action .	-3.2274
Is it possible to protect emails against reading ?	-1.6394
With an encryption after the OpenPGP standard , an email can be encrypted effectively against reading .	-2.3635
With a high technical effort , it is also possible to conceal the metadata of email communication , so that even without any further detection of who has communicated with whom .	-4.2846
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-1.6062
The mainly privately used mailboxes play Yahoo and Google according to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013 only play a subordinate role .	-3.6582
While the shares of Yahoo mail were last fallen , Google ’ s GMail could significantly grant .	-7.3032
Mother in the Forest , and Pensions	-3.0235
When his mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forgotten a plan .	-2.3460
He carried out the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pension and care money .	-3.3990
In order to be able to cash out further pensions and care money , a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after the police investigations in the forest .	-4.0370
Initially , he covered the death of the 89 years , then he had removed money for more than one and a half years .	-3.9973
Now the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud , as a spokesman said on Friday .	-2.7802
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-1.9876
The man has already been suspected in May : at that time , the mother was no longer needed for the care n need .	-3.9757
Investigators told the pensioner that his mother was travelled to Spain .	-2.1424
Because officials did this strange , they continued to identify .	-2.8689
In this context , the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and had last maintained them .	-3.6028
Finally , the 67-year-old have granted the death of his mother .	-2.4448
According to police , obduction did not result in any evidence of capital crimes .	-3.0649
Are you looking for ice creams lit in the dark ?	-2.8590
A British entrepreneur has developed the first light ice in the dark – using sources .	-2.8819
Charlie Francis used the fluorescent properties of the sea animals and created a light delicacy from this .	-4.3622
The idea came to him after he had read a research work over sources , and could convince Chinese scientists to produce the light protein artificially .	-7.5585
The ice cream responds when consuming with the tongue , thereby increasing the ph value in the protein and triggering the light .               t       	-4.5004
Chris explains that the dining ice reacts to the heat in the mouth and lightened – the more you lick , the brighter it will .	-3.3703
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I 'm Delicious ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still at a very early production phase , and so they get two grams for 200 pounds . ”	-3.4663
The protein used in the ice cream responds to a neutral pH value .	-2.2179
When the mouth heats the protein , the pH value and the ice will rise            i        	-3.5071
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween into the market because it has this wonderful light effect  .                         a          	-4.7983
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever manufactured , four times more expensive than gold .	-2.4414
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.2924
But it is delicious for this .	-2.1289
Charlies experimental company with headquarters in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-2.9460
But its most recent creation should be even more ambitious .	-3.4140
He says : “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-1.8456
This is impossible and is impossible for itself because of the light breakdown caused by the ice crystals that consist of ice creams ; but I suspect we find an opportunity to create it .	-4.3835
The Ice Cream uses the fluorescent properties of a source produced by Chinese scientists artificially .	-2.4769
The TSV Morsum is still without every point in the Handball Association League after six days of play .	-2.8503
The team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow comes to the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-3.6120
With this game the season begins new for us .	-1.9933
" I hope that we finally have the head " will behave optimistic .	-2.8841
He finally has his complete cader with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme .	-3.0845
Daverden also relies on tempo game .	-2.7213
That is why we must keep our error rate low .	-2.3650
First and foremost , however , we must increase in the coverage that has left everything behind it as a safe impression .	-3.8535
Daverden ’ s Coach Thomas Panitz is more relaxed after the first season victory against Northorn .	-3.4299
The game was , of course , a house number .	-1.5097
But that is why we are still not the favorite because everything can happen in the Derby .	-3.1900
Nevertheless , Panitz wants to start a series in Morsum .	-3.0547
Missing Jan-Malte is Jodat .	-2.8686

Halloween 2013 : In numbers	-1.4080
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.4934
My sisters and I have been able to eat sweets late and dress us for the neighbourhood .	-3.2796
Today I have become the Halloween muffle .	-2.4375
In the last two years I have not explained to distribute from my apartment from sweetness , and probably this year will not do so .	-3.7659
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep about Halloween .	-2.0124
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precisely – celebrate halloween this year , thus spending $ 6.9 billion on sweetness , costumes , and decorations , such as the US Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-3.9337
One thing I look forward to each halloween again is the trend values .	-2.6433
Costumes will account for approximately $ 1.2 billion issued by the US $ 6.9 billion , such as NR              	-3.8098
This year , exciting unlively items are the last cry .	-3.2566
Women no longer have to cover themselves in sexy clothing , they can now embody seductive food such as Pizza , Hamburg or Karotten .	-3.9027
With regard to men , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft-Punk world space space will create it into the instagram feeds this year .	-3.5067
According to Google , most of the costumes are Zombies , Batman , Pirates and Witches .	-2.6460
I suspect it is nothing traditional .	-2.1557
Last year , we have clothed our dogs and were not alone to my amazing surpris                        	-5.1858
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on pets ’ costumes , such as NRF .	-2.6073
That is a lot of “ hot dogs . ”	-1.7223
With regard to sweetness , we are not q p              	-3.6539
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , The Nielsen Company .	-1.7263
These are approximately 270 million kilograms of chocolate labels , volumes , bonbons and rubbers .	-2.9185
So good news for the according to the US Trade Ministry of 41 million people drawing through the quarters with the speech “ sweet or acid . ”	-3.9679
Indeed , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for halloween and – let us not find ourselves – nothing .	-3.4673
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweetened candy corn ; nevertheless , 15 million kilograms are sold from halloween , so the National Association of Sweet Growers Manufacturers .	-3.8023
These are about nine billion maize grains .	-2.1049
It is a puzzle that I have not yet been able to r .	-2.3737
Nothing belongs to halloween as houses in which it is spukt  .	-2.4312
You have great names such as “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is also in a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock    . ”	-3.0368
There are indeed 1,200 officially recognised spukhhouses in the United States , which achieve $ 500 million , said America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photos on which you are finking yourself into the hoses and then putting friends on Facebook , where you will not reload them again , and one the type that you stand leaves behind like “ nice face expression ” .	-6.8962
But let us finally get to the burials .	-2.5444
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Kurbis when we were children , and the cutting of a curved laternal is like the jewelry of the Christmas tree – something that we have made from smal      .	-4.0818
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest , so that most of us have grown up with carrying the burb and not sitting in it .	-4.0117
This year , Americans will spend approximately $ 106 million on scratches , such as the US Census Bureau .	-2.9916
The Kürbislaterne , which is slowly reduced in the foregard , is probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms were harvested this year .	-4.1362
If you would like to point correctly , then call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut something heavy from their 921 kilos of serious curbs .	-4.1375

Germany ’ s largest country church has an offensive start to promote the pastor ’ s profession .	-2.5975
The background is a possible shortage of parish : the Evangelian-Lutherian church of Landeskirche Hannover expects to halve the number of currently around 1,800 pastors after the present s situ           by  203  .                        	-5.7026
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in discussion with the Evangelic Press Service .	-3.5162
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day process itself .	-2.7098
With Burfien , the church has for the first time asked a pastor at a full place to enthusiase young people for the theology study .	-3.5342
At the moment , fewer young people choose to study theology after the abiture .	-3.9816
Burfies returns to the process of decision : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.1490
The profession of great freedom and diversity is shaped .	-3.3259
I am Mr Mincalender and can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-3.2923
Pastors could be close to the people as a sea concern .	-2.5888
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well from it .	-1.9011
Certainly , the free economy is paid more , but theologists would have a safe employer . T i t i   . T  T   'Po ' is        . T 	-7.6445
This comes against the young people of today , who are not only about careers but about a meaningful wor      w . I w wo         	-5.1022
According to the church , which includes three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors a year go into retirement .	-3.8531
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology study start their vicariation .	-2.1004
In thin sparsely peripheral areas such as the heart , the Emsland or the Wendland , it can be difficult in future to occupy jobs .	-4.1162
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people and also invite prominents to have studied theology .	-4.1171
The theology study offers broad education .	-2.1517

Drew Bowler , managing director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.4850
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for voltage and adventure as well as a reachable way to world-class events .	-3.2970
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with country Rover and the MSA and believe that the format explores new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and to prepare newly for the strapaces and the reality of Rally Raid .	-4.3427

Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical bailout team , said : “ She was in a dangerous position .	-2.3486
It was located in the middle of the rocky wall – 15 meters from top and the ground .	-3.0312
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like stiff .	-2.3482
But now it is good .	-2.4825
She has then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.1912
That was quite an unusual effort .	-2.5746
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible .	-1.3851
Peter Lau , specialist of the technical bailout team , said : “ Ruby had a huge happiness . ”	-2.6363
The possibility was that it was very difficult to injure or worse .	-3.1310
Ruby was brought to the veterinary physician , but nothing was found beyond exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.0509
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ When rescuing was frightening . ”	-2.8888
I could not believe that it was really there .	-2.1991
It was wonderful to keep them in the poor again .	-1.8738

It was really bold what they did .	-1.6194
We are simply grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.7183

George Kerevan : European Unbundling gives the Scots the Election	-1.9512
A new day , a new horror story to independence .	-1.7917
This time , we are warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.1721
This provides the keyword for history about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed-wire border along the Hadrian Wall .	-3.9393
Indeed , in the strathclyde template , the possible economic benefits that would bring greater freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but this – expectedly – was not a role in the headlines .	-3.9277
Nor has also mentioned that EU member states often turn their strict rules into them more favourable  .	-6.6051
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area , the continued non-consideration for Brussels would only be a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Scots .	-3.4934
So not actually a story .	-2.0597
And one that has already come to a year that it is already a fossil : the first time I have heard the “ independence means passport controls ” down at least 40 years ago .	-3.9052
An interesting point is lost in constant repeating this ancient history .	-2.8913
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe ?	-2.1759
Why exchange the London Joch against Brussels , especially now ?	-2.6746
These are the real European news : the great plan for the war to unify Europe has been falling .	-3.4913
The European project has died officially with the euro crisis .	-1.8182
Everywhere in the EU , parties win ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro as a common currency overboard .	-3.6743
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party has been able to found alternative to Germany – only this year – just five million votes in the Federal Election in September , thereby effectively driving the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-4.5263
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.8404
But the current economic crisis is a turning point .	-1.9500
Because of the strict austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in conjunction with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is needed by adhering to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-3.7971
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive budget deficits – that was only the case in Greece .	-2.5648
Instead , the Eurosystem has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to leave  .  T ’ s a p ’ s s   s s  . I  w	-7.5630
Without the possibility of devaluating the local currency , southern Europe is restoring a built-in productivity disadvantage to Germany .	-3.1847
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.1979
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems , there is a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.6180
As a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines regulated by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays compared to the United States the double for electricity and four times for gas .	-3.3874
This is a paralysis of costs , as we have already seen in Grangemouth .	-2.5357
All wage festivals in the world do not protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American shale gas .	-2.8045
As a result , a revolt is being drawn up , especially in France , the EU 's one-time cheerleader .	-3.1241
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle that could keep Germany in check and lift Paris on eyes with Washington .	-3.6092
But Berlin needs Paris no longer a gateway to political legitimacy , and has expressed Europe its own economic policy , thereby fighting the French economy .	-6.0147
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , EU-hostile front national has just gained a crucial election and thus referred the governing socialists to three .	-4.2791
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of voters – a contemporary warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a division in the right spectrum would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-3.3765

It wants to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.3561

This is the point I want to say : in the not-too-distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will find themselves together to abolish the euro .                  	-3.5847
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” favoring the General de Gaulle .	-2.8902
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.5484
I expect Britain to be distanced by this project in the hope of fulfilling itself with t  U .	-3.3301
However , Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific space suggests that Britain will be in the Atlantic rain alone .	-2.4880
Where does Scotland remain in e ?	-2.3878
We can decide to be a region of ( last consistency ) small England .	-2.2516
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can do where they can .	-2.7897
I suspect that Scotland could drive well in a more relaxed European association unless we keep our own currency .	-3.0406
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.3164
Otherwise , we should consider it equal to Norway and keep our economic independence .	-2.4259
The SNP administration in Scotland is – remarkably – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and has gained a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the following Tory-Lib Dem Coalition had to be responsible .	-3.9183
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide on an independence now , only to force austerity from Berlin and Brussels to be  forced .	-3.5419
Early Puberty : Faster Growth	-1.3734
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white age colleagues , as investigations show  .	-4.2029

Should a mother be concerned when her daughter already grows at the age of seven or eight years of breasts and shamhairs ?	-2.9349
At the American Academy of Pediatrics Annual Conference this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal under American girls and a new standard .	-3.2560
“ I spend a lot of time to reassure parents – usually this is no sign that puberty is now entering , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-3.7841
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hairs , and body smell , are showing girls earlier .	-3.5894
However , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch ( appearing of the first rule blood ) over the past 40 years .	-3.5311
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , somewhat less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.2153
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to menarch , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early Puberty for Girls : The essential consumer to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-4.1255
Time is the most accurate test of how the puberty is moving forward .	-2.3824
It is controversial , which is indeed the start of puberty , but it is “ early ” if breast enlargement is accompanied by a growth boost before an age of eight .	-3.7045
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that can monitor carefully .	-2.3767
Faster advances could test through an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumor or cysts can be excluded .	-3.2495
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and defending another consequence : the premature aging of the bones , which can ultimately lead to growth and thus small growth in adults .	-4.0547
The recommendations for medication or hormonal therapy are oriented at the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .	-2.8725
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.1534
Kaplowitz is restrained as far as medicines are concerned , but he acknowledges : “ The oppression of puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls , unlike their age colleagues . ”	-4.3354
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-2.1277
“ They worry about pregnancy risk or how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-2.9077
“ It was a shock , ” remembers a woman whose daughter has received ten days .	-2.6615
Even though there were first signs and we had spoken about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-3.1710
She came frightened and excited from school to home because she was the first in her friendship .	-3.3720
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.0127
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be caused .	-8.9998
Young come into puberty similar to girls earlier .                    	-3.7724
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.8479
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 about girls at the age of six to nine years , which produces a link between body fat and entry to puberty .	-3.2802
Other investigations support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.0137
In that country , Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach the puberty rather than their white age confessions .	-3.3773
There are different explanations for this .	-1.7159
Globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by all possible things , from economic conditions to the climate to genes .	-2.5816
Another puzzle : Although young grows face and shame hair earlier , the trend is not as striking as if girls are fully expressed .	-6.8281
Other doctors at the AAP conference highlight the complexity of the issue .	-1.8898
Acne and Shamhaar acne are distributed even in babies and young children .	-3.6709
“ We must be careful , as we identify the true start of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at Goryeb Children ’ s Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-2.7413
Parents should not hesitate to advise themselves from their child physician how they should speak to their child .	-2.8384
“ This can mean that we need to have a conversation earlier than expected , ” ried Kaplowitz .	-3.5789
If you remain calm , the child usually reacts well .	-2.4152
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it enters earlier than inte   t .	-3.4678
Jumbo manufacturers argue about seat widths	-2.7765
Between leading aircraft manufacturers , there has been a dispute over the width of seats in the tourist class of long-distance flights , which indicates the sound for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month .                     	-4.6804
The dispute revolves around the seat width that passengers are offered for long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are trying to do the most , but this experienced room is the key to efficiency claims in the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . .	-5.9824
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the American Archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide th .	-3.9471
The debate comes at a time when the aircraft constructors compete to sell even greater versions of their two-engine long-track flights and expect record orders from November 17th to 21st .	-4.1432
As the background part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – is essential for the economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design should be delivered .	-4.4021
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 777X ” takes 406 people at seats in the tourist class , who are more than 17 inches and thus allow ten per series                    	-4.2941
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per series .	-3.4310
Aircraft giants often share levels of technical details using advertising in the specialis pr  .             	-3.8791
Now Airbus is appealing before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X will expect to make the race directly to the public wi  over   100 orders      .	-3.4957
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the start of a new advertising war , and donors showed an image in which three people sit in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-4.1707
“ Boeing proposes long-standing flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo properties , ” says Airbus ’ sales leader John Leahy .	-3.2438
Given changed nutritional habits , people are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-2.7684
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined the modern long-standing journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average American has increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , such as the US Ministry of Health .	-3.7363
The scope of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics .	-2.9344
Airbus says that his rival was considered a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body scope of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set . ”	-3.7497
You have carried out Airbus , investigations that showed that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53  % .	-3.6607
Boeing disputes the figures of Airbus among the seats and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers how airlines create the balance between airlines and establis .	-3.6856
The company also explains , according to investigations , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .	-3.0467
“ There really is to give flexibility to airlines so that they can do what they believe to be successful , ” the aircraft expert Kent Craver of Boeing explains .	-3.6805
They do not want us to dictate what it makes profitable .	-2.0315
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.4398
For passengers it is about greater freedom of iron , but for manufacturers it will increasingly become a subject that can have on the turnover .	-4.5066
Behind the conflict , a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a sustainable impact on the US or European export balance .	-3.7506
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the confrontation of the new jets .	-2.4815
Both Airbus and Boeing claim to be 20 % greater efficiency per seat in their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.3885
The Boeings statements on the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per series with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .            1  seats    is    c .	-4.9113
Increased costs per unit are still lower than ten seats used at the moment .	-3.0150
“ Boeing quetscht therefore seats in his aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-3.2348
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per series at existing 777s suggested that many passengers decided for the closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper air tariffs .	-3.7282
“ Eighteen customs seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the threat of the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin establishment , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.2437
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select .	-2.5973
The world-travelling jet sellers even contribute bandmass to measuring the competition .	-4.8016
Even if they are awarded to comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly comprehensive design for cheap airlines and regional flights .	-4.3579
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seated rows , but has not yet sold according to its own statement .	-2.6841
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered broad seats on the corridors for some jets .	-3.2956
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard will probably be converted , but could divert from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.0538
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Make Garage	-2.2686
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could eat fun in smokin .	-2.6102
A single dose of vaccine has been able to protect mice for a life ag nicotine d ' .	-3.3556
Before testing people , further attempts are needed , which can take some years , but Professor Ronald Crystal said from the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York that the first results are good .	-3.6944
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to stop , trying to try all methods available on the market , but have had to experience their addiction of nicotine more than those approaches , ” said Cornell .	-4.6501
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed in such a way that it contains genetic information for the production of nicotine antibodies .	-2.8084
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent electricity of antibodies .	-3.4078
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which makes a smoker no nicotin high learn .	-3.6416
In attempts , vaccinated mice , which was administered nicotine , retained its normal level of activity .	-4.0317
Mice without vaccination would have taken an “ out-time , ” the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached their brain   .      T '  s    s a 	-5.5190
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine specialist s .	-2.0241
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.7047
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level so often that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.5846
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably lower , because it turns liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.6592
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people when he was quite sure that children would be administered before they tried to try a cigarette , and thus prevent nicotine desire .	-3.8770
But more likely is that smokers would use it to stop .	-1.8421
“ You know : If they start to smoke again , they do not find pleasures because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to put the habit ” , he explains .	-4.7910

On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations on the question of whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend legal contracts at Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without expulsion after their expiry in August 2005 .	-4.6771
Now it is identified because of the accusation that Tripodi has known hidden interest in the principles after Tripodi ’ s previous deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole on Thursday .	-4.5618
In years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the legal contracts .	-3.3941
The pages were against it and wanted to run longer times .	-3.6517
In 2009 , the contracts for the Circular Quay companies , which taken $ 2.5 million annually , were extended without public tendering .	-9.7265
Tripodi , who was port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , was originally expressed for public tenders .	-2.9045
But he disputed the changes to Obeid ’ s requests , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a redesign of the government ’ s rules o  ru          .	-4.8307
One of the ICAC 's telephone locations showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a leading official who was changed to the Ministry of Ports after working on the object in the Fisheries Authority .	-4.0239
“ Was the issue discussed in these telephone talks about developing commercial contempt rules ? ” , the Deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-3.5960

Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to “ reality test	-5.0924
The government is thinking of enlarged measures on a “ reality test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-2.9071
If the test is introduced , it would come to use a criterion that should prevent the 457 to occupy unqualified jobs or as a backdoor for the pull of family and friends to Australia .	-3.9123
Today , a proposal for a discussion was published by the government after the former Members of the Labor Party , Maxine McKev , condemned the government 's comments on foreign workers , because they could be seen as insult by Australia 's neighbours .	-3.9698
“ Voluntary explanations like foreigners should stop “ and , Australians first , ” are a very unpleasant decline in times when trade unions called for a protected labour market , ” she said today to the Australia India Institute .            I   am   su  p  .	-5.9312
Historically , it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region take an echo of this historic artifact , I would not surprise myself .	-3.5597
The proposal for a discussion runs twelve measures , once considered by the former Minister of Immigration , Chris Bowen .	-3.3999
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who referred to talks yesterday about human smuggling in Sri Lanka , has implemented five of the recommended changes that others are still considered .	-4.1014

A study was announced by the British Government to increase the advantages of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.8802
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to realize high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England with the beginning of phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.2333
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.0101
The Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.5099
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-1.8932
Following phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.3662
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of constructing the high-speed road between London and Northern Gland from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds .	-2.7203
The British Government , which is in discussions with Transport Scotland , has asked HS2 Ltd to search for further routes and travel time improvements for northern England and Scotland .	-3.7466
This includes the possibility of a travel time from ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-2.5230
Baroness Kramer said , “ Our goal for HS2 is a really national route network that brings Britain closer together and its cities together . ”	-2.7600
We are proceeding with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.4759
Without it , we face a capacity crisis in our railway network .	-1.9642
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.4073
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.0712
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called upon “ clearly ” for Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-3.0230
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link connects the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but at the same time the economic power of Scotland also provides an argument for rapid rail connections throughout Britain . ”	-3.9913
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner for the British Government and to investigate the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland that creates benefits for all and complements the connection of Glasgow-Edinburgh , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-3.7808
I look forward to examining the British Ministers ' investigation report next year and together to adopt the next steps .	-2.9519
Rules on electronic equipment in aircraft remain provisionally in force	-3.8544
Australian aircraft passengers must continue to switch tablets and smartphones on start and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax the regulations for such equipment .	-3.5611
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements , so that passengers can read or play videos on their equipment during critical airport phases during critical airports , if they are in the “ flight mode . ”	-4.1877
During the majority of the flight , passengers are already allowed this , but many people find it annoying that they may not read their e-books when starting and landing .	-3.5293
Australian societies monitor the decision to which American airlines must do an amount of work , but do not pursue direct plans to amend their rules .	-3.9170
The CASA Air Safety Authority also stated that the announcement was seen , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment are still in place in Australia .	-4.3208
“ The CASA has not currently made any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft , ” has been sus .	-3.8720
The issue is subject to provisions that airlines maintain safety at any time and must follow the safety instructions given by cabin personnel .	-3.3408
Virgin has already conducted discussions on the use of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and explained that it is open to changes , but they should be initiated by the legislator .	-3.8885
“ We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic equipment by the CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a spokesman .	-3.6491
Qantas explained that the current regulations will be remained until the   d  ' . T i  t w .	-5.9692
" Our current directives provided that electronic equipment should not be used when starting and landing , and we have no plans to change , " said the company .	-3.8768
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.6488
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit and will certainly look at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.0494
The decision is different from US societies depending on the age of the fleet .	-2.6962
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate the disturbances of mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer subsidiary .	-4.5823
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lightweight electronic equipment such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones , ” the FAA announced .	-3.7258
In rare cases in bad view , the crew will provide passengers while landing to switch the devices .	-3.1836
The group also recommended that you securely study more serious devices at start and landing under the seat or in the seats over the seats .	-4.8701

Before the Friday game of the Football Federal League against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras responded with a silence - first .	-3.2846
It was an unusual , almost spectacular acoustic that offered the viewer to the start of the Federal League Game between the German Vicemaster Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park .	-4.0476
Mostly the guest fans were heard with their singings .	-2.6019
The South Gallery against where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand extraordinarily quietly : no singings , no battlegrounds .	-4.4249
The podest of the capo , which otherwise coordinates the common infirmation , remained unoccupied .             	-3.4474
And quite front on the gallery , a large flag with the label " Section Stadium Ban " was launched .  T ' Th  '  S '   is  a s s	-8.0437
Only as Torhut Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player entered the place , branded short-term jubles .	-3.7517
When his team colleagues followed , there were strong vocal singing and sheltering - but not everywhere .	-3.8317
There was nothing in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South Gallery .	-2.8049
Norbert Dickel again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - derby victory , victory over Arsenal , contractual extension of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide holidays .	-4.1255
Only five minutes before the start the Capo excluded its podest - and the tension that was just with hands tangible until then excluded in a loud cry , when thickles as usually queried the mood on the ranks at the stadium .	-6.1643
As always the south glasses were at the row - and finally here was again the loudest place in the stadium .	-4.2343
And at the latest when the South Gallery started the loud request " Derby victor was " again , everything was as always .	-5.2777
The silence previously was a response to the events of recent days .                   	-3.2802
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the most travelled BVB supporters had fired light missiles into the viewers and the place - and met almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller .	-4.8216
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.0045
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke received the top of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believe Watzke 's words was a more uncomfortable date for the fan representatives .	-3.6439
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " announced the BVB boss on Thursday evening on a podium discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.0258
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited Ultras from choreography for home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-2.9901
'That I have banned ' , he explained .	-2.5109
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnology .	-1.8396
Moreover , the ultras have shown various opportunities for punishment - until Tuesday they have time to decide for one .	-3.8987
Otherwise , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of the coming week .	-2.5616
" This becomes cutting " , insured wattles .	-3.4692
We must be eager to see how the reactions on the south gallery are then .	-4.5285
Houses booming in Singapore , as the crisis has arrived in the middle class	-2.8088
In a pandhouse in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden army , ring and a couple of earrings to pay their daughters ’ school fees .	-4.0190
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is my whole money through , ” says Amirthalinga .	-2.8302
Although they deserve 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( approximately EUR 1,730 ) as administrative employee , and her man also work , the monthly family income is not enough , s sh    e .	-4.0110
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is such that ValueMax , where she has made her exchange , was the third house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-3.5295
The jewelry pleasure is not only a fast way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but almost as favourable as an unsa l                               	-3.6896
Typically , pandhouses in Singapore require an effective 17 % interest rate , which is just over the 15.4 % required by United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-4.0094
However , homes offer the advantage that there is no review of credit rating or income proof , which is why loans are faster than banks .	-4.0192
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to pandhouses after families feel the pressure of rising living costs and increasing budgetary and consumer debt .	-4.4960
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans , because of a relaxed financial policy in the developed economic areas , families with lower and medium-income houses are seeking to compensate for the difference in stalling economies .	-4.5734
This week , the Standard & Poor ’ s rating agency described growing budget debt , mainly by rising mortgages , as a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.0878
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the agency , have the highest budget debt in Asia in relation to GDP .	-2.7299
Malaysia is at the top of the list , an increase of 60 % in 2008 .	-2.2300
Economists are also concerned about the high debt of consumer debt in Thailand , which has come out of just this week from a technical recessi             .	-3.4284
On Thursday , the data continued to show existing weaknesses and degradation of consumer demand .	-2.6303
“ In the end , this means that , with rising costs , people will try to complement their incomes in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) , wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.7305
Historical maximums of gold prices over the past two years have stepped up the trend towards personal items , because people use the opportunity to turn the jewelry of the family into cash .	-4.3083

The largest Thai home operator , EasyMoney , has experienced 20 % increase in its branches in recent months .	-3.0180
The growth in panda growth is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , said Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.0961
The company finances this with 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-3.4878
While some lenders have fallen into cross-fire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that houses do not only provide more favourable interest rates than other renters , but also not directly increase                    	-4.8587

Rescue package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman health care	-2.5094
The Australian Government is on the tough conditions linked to the Tasman health package of over 325 million Australian dollars to ensure that the government of the federal state cannot waste the money .	-3.3344
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate measures ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases and systemic restrictions .	-2.9989
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasman MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-2.5780
“ The government has launched an emergency rescue package , which , in our view , addresses the unique challenges that the federal state faces , ” said today .	-4.1082
The 325 million dollar package covers $ 31 million immediately for electoral services .	-2.5291
Another 2600 operations , including orthopedic interventions and treatments for grey star , should be eliminated backwards .	-3.2465
Moreover , there are money for day clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better care for stationary stays , specialist training , mental health services , and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-3.7050
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that I have said to me that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-3.0639
The Minister insisted on a strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman Government .	-2.1952
The federal state must maintain the current level of financing to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money has been spent .	-3.4647
A three-headed Commission will be established and should ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-2.8339
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would only be useful if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the public Tasman health system to a more sustainable course . ”	-3.1944
Nevertheless , he praised the government for having responded to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .	-3.2862
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the public health system of the state from the concern list , ” said Wilkie .	-2.9579
According to the government of the state , these electoral services will largely compete the recent cuts .	-2.6926
But the health policy spokesman of the opposition at Federal Level , Peter Dutton , believes that today 's announcement is only a “ palaster solution . ”	-3.3337
“ We are therefore in today ’ s situation because the Laboratory Government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-2.7233
It cannot be that a government government is almost half a billion dollars from the system and increases Commonwealth 300 million , and then do so as if the good news is .	-4.6346
Dutton called for plibersec to be guaranteed that not one dollar of the bailout package is spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.8153

Syria has destroyed its opportunity to manufacture chemical weapons , as a group of monitoring	-6.6536
Syria has destroyed important facilities to manufacture chemical weapons and toxic gas munition , explained the global surveillance group for chemical weapons on Thursday , while in the north of the country it came close to one of the locations where allegedly toxic substances are stored .	-3.9519
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the beginning of the civil war soon .	-2.7540
The announcement of the Organization for the Ban on Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date .	-2.5281
1 . November , which the Damascus organization based in The Hague had set to destroy all facilities to make chemical weapons or make “ inoperable ” , including all machines for mixing chemicals on toxic gas and filling ammuni .	-3.7679
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone of an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all chemical weapons of Syria by mid-2014 .	-3.0346
The destruction of institutions means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons more  .               	-3.1193
Damascus still needs to start destroying existing weapons and stocks .	-2.5878
Assuming that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and Nervengas Sarin .	-2.8071
The announcement came at a time when struggles in the city of Safira took place on Thursday , experts say that there was a production establishment for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights in Britain .	-4.5723
The activist group , which follows the number of dead via a network of activists in Syria , explained on Thursday that 120.296 people died .	-3.1988
Of these , 61.067 civilians , including 6.365 children .	-2.0679
On the part of the government , 29.954 of them were the army of President Bashar Assad , 18.678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.0279
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 fighters of the opposition , many of them foreigners .	-2.8208
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-1.9444
This figure has not been updated .	-1.6159
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee from the country .	-1.9714
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting against the rebels for weeks in Safira , many of which have many connections to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.6957
The Observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but no details called .	-2.7972
The fighting underlines the danger that the chemical weapons inspectors are exposed , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a top civil war .	-3.5164
According to the OPCW , working closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen all the important production and filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has seen its destruction . ”	-4.0490
That is why “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-2.7553
Earlier this week , the inspectors explained that they had completed the first round of reviews and visited 21 of Damascus 's 23 sites .	-3.3399
Because of security concerns , two facilities visited them , the inspectors said .	-2.8244
On Thursday , OPWC explained that the two locations were “ abandoned ” according to Syrian statement ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme existed were shifted to other institutions that were inspi . ”	-3.9921
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.5488
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which needs to be approved by the OPWC executive committee next month .	-2.6948
“ I draw the sacrifice before the braveness and courage you have shown all the most challenging mission ever shown by this organization , ” Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organization in a comment published by OPCW .	-4.0129
For three years now , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war against Assad ’ s government and its security forces , which many members belong to the Alawites , have been secessing Shia Islam .	-3.5113
With regard to further developments , the Head of the Observatory , Rami Abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defense institution in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-3.4517
The cause of explosion was not known , he explained .	-2.1096
Anger over Bombing Decisions i Bali	-5.7981
Surviving and relatives of the 202 people who were living in 2002 at the Bali bomb attack in 2002 reacted against the judgment for the last of the installers presented to justice because Umar Patek should be shot legally .	-5.2320
Patek , who was one of South-East Asia ’ s most famous people at the time of ten years , was condemned yesterday for his role in constructing bodies for the bombing attack on a penalty of 20 years .	-5.2456
He could be dismissed after 15 years of criminal suspension .	-2.4276
The 45th anniversary was guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two nightclubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injur .	-3.4898
A guilt was also carried out in a number of terrorist-related charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia in Heiligabend in 2000 .	-3.7154
The prosecutor had called for a lifelong prison , even if it is called “ Demolition Man ” for the man , who is called the death penalty because of his reputation as a master bomber farmer .	-4.4035
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth , who lost her 39 years old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation established by patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago .	-4.0616
With tears she fighting she said that patek should have been condemned to death .	-2.4668
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other cerl .	-2.3883
“ You should put him in front of a shot command , ” said Corteen to AAP .	-2.6108
I have to live with every day that I will not get another grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .	-3.0493

Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds were a suicide bomber exploding a backpack filled with explosion    .                 .  	-5.3504
After the attack , he fell into the Koma for a month and “ died ” three times , while he did in a life conservation system .	-3.8842
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-3.0124
In fact , this type of type should get the death penalty abov all others .	-4.0371
Letting him life – no , there is no reason to let him life .	-2.1305
Twenty years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much .	-2.6098
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber that was in court .	-2.5145
He was almost a decade of arrest , but was finally taken up in the Pakistani city in January 2011 , where US forces killed Osama bin Laden almost four months later .	-4.0107
During the negotiation , a FBI agent said that intelligence reports would have provided the indication that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.4975
“ He did not make , ” said Corteen .	-2.0649
Until recently , he has not shown repentance of how much suffering he has dealt with other people .	-2.7850
The judgment took place before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is committed with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia .	-3.1513
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.5895
Patek can appeal to his judgment .	-2.2706
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not lead mobile talks )	-3.0032
Flight travelers can now listen to their electronic equipment for reading , working , games , music and using the reputation of movies , but not telephone with the mobile phone , such as the new directives published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-4.1232
But passengers should not expect these changes to be immediately implemented .	-1.8743
How quickly they would be implemented , declared by the respective airline , FAA employees Michael Huerta explained at a press conference .         A  t .	-4.2656
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the air staff and the regulations for the trust of the equipment according to the new rules .	-4.1053
The FAA said that it has already received plans from some airlines which want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.0561
Delta and JetBlue were also under these airlines .	-1.7633
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic equipment very soon ” , the FAA announced in an authorisation .	-4.0219
Currently passengers must switch smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-2.8353
They may only run again if the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives green light .	-3.4045
When entering the landing attitude , passengers must return them again and not restart them before the aircraft is landed .	-4.1548
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disorders could allow their passengers to use the devices in start , landing and on the roll field could also explain the FAA .	-3.9846
Most new traffic aircraft and other aircraft that have been rearranged for the use of Wi-Fi in larger amounts should comply with the criteria .	-3.8187
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Association of Professional Aircraft , welcomed the changes .	-2.0690
“ If the new regulation is safely implemented – and we are working closely together with the airline – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented glading .	-3.3581
We are honestly sorry to feel about this issue like updates .	-3.2086
Nevertheless , Internet connections to surfing , exchanging e-mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the Authority explaine .               	-3.9948
Passengers are called upon to enable smartphones , tablets and other devices to the flight mode .	-3.2063
So no “ Words With Friends , ” the scrabble similar online game that Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 when he left public effectiveness a jet of American Airlines because he refused to switch the device while the aircraft was parked at the aircraft .	-3.9932
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be suspended , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-3.4319
Mobile discussions remain also prohibited during the flight  .	-2.6228
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA , is       th    r t                   	-4.3922
FAA may lift bans on certain electronic equipment when starting and landin    	-6.9607
Last month , Mark Rosenker said the National Transportation Safety Board transport security authority , security experts for national transport issues on CBS News , mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-4.2669
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disturbances in navigation equipment , but because we know from the FCC that transmission can also disturb sendmasters , ” said Rosenker .	-4.1190
A consultation committee of the industry set up by the FAA to investigate this issue recommended last month that the government allowed a broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-3.3705
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-2.1727
Critics like the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri represent the view that there is no valid security reason for bannin  .	-2.7904
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the devices has become e ma .	-3.7091
In some studies there is talk of forgetting or ignoring the switching of the device up to a third of passengers .	-3.2018
The FAA started restricting the use of electronic equipment by air travellers in 1966 after reports on disruptions of navigation and communication equipment by passengers were known radios that were the latest technical trend .	-4.3854
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed and approved by the FAA that they do not accept electronic interferences .	-3.0892
Airlines have been offering passengers for several years Wi-Fi if the airport is reached .	-3.2481
The flyers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more insensitive to interferences .	-2.6379
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.5509
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally gives much less radiation than previous generations .	-2.4649
E-readers , for example , provide only minimal radiation when rediscovered .	-3.2551
But when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.1133
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of relaxing restrictions on the device usage of passengers .	-3.2498
In 2011 , company staff invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not find anyone .	-3.3644
Members of the FAA Consulting Committee expressed mixed feelings of the risk of using equipment .	-2.7048
Douglas Kidd said about the National Association of Airline Passengers , he believed that the disruption is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.3117
Other committee members said that there are only separate reports of pilots that speak for the disruption of aircraft systems through the devices , and most of them are very ol                 	-3.7195
The committee , however , recommended the FAA to allow pilots to order the switching of the devices through the passengers when landing instruments under bad views .	-4.4166
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described it as a reasonable adjustment for travellers who would be extensively equipped with technology today .	-3.4764
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not contrary to security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of U.S. Travel Association .	-2.7941
Released Birds restored by North Sea Bridge Services	-7.4591
An air salvation service to the coast of flown birds , which was found exhausted on a North Sea Drill , was released into nature .	-3.8614
The water ralls were flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was papered by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in their rescue centre in Alloa .	-3.7391
Colin Seddon , Head of the Centre , said : “ This waterral was probably a winter bird of northern Europe , stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-3.1567
Apparently , the exhausted bird seeked refuge on the drill island .	-2.4904
He added : “ He could no longer fly why we were contacted with the request f h . ”	-2.8566
In their release , the waterralls were fit and healthy .                     	-4.8541
Is Europe ’ s Elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-2.0271
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy to a table and defining what those who provide for wealth and work in Britain want to change our relations with the EU .	-3.5997
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-2.8851
YouGov consulted more than 1,000 leaders from the economy that image in about British business sizes , sectors and regions .	-3.8171
The results of the survey are surprised by many .	-1.6064
We have found that the vast majority of companies now export outside Europe and focus on countries that modernise and grow , while the states in the EU stagnate .	-3.4376
They want new trade connections with countries like China , India , and Brazil to be favored by government side , rather than stimulating the long and effortive process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-3.7393
The majority of the economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be retired to Westminster .	-3.1678
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , since , according to the statement by companies , the costs of the Brussels rules would now overwhelm the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed with the most traditionally Europe-friendly ones                     	-4.9127
Finally , and probably the most , our survey of economic leaders said that a clear majority from the United Kingdom wanted a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade not on politi .	-3.7280
This recognition , which is found in companies of all sizes and leading companies , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ useful change , ” which brings the symptom of action back to Britain .	-4.2440
There is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a change in opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum .	-4.0716
The Prime Minister should not have any doubts : this survey shows that the British economy is behind its plan for the renegotiations of British conditions for EU membership .	-2.8690
It also demonstrates that companies are expecting a clear shift in power relationships to the UK from a renegotiation .	-3.5088
A better deal for the British economy is possible and is increasingly needed , after the eurozone is now moving towards a closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.8558
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention to trade and fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-3.1005

Consultation before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA employees prior to accusations against Jonathan Lord for sexual delicates           a c  .	-4.0879
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) have been accused of sexual delicates relating to children before 2011 accusations against the career Jonathan Lord from Caringbah have been implemented , as the Royal Commission has seen for sexual abuse of children .	-4.7485
But in the opening declaration before the Commission , the YMCA had stated that “ never had an incident of sexual abuse ” in the organisation .	-4.2466
Managing director Phillip Hare was questioned about one case in which an YMCA employee was charged with child pornography , and another in which an YMCA Caringbah Hall sports teacher was sentenced to him because of the abuse of abuse of entrusted children .  T                      	-5.3117
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission 's assisting lawyers , that he knew from the first case , but had not known the second .	-2.4808
He acknowledged that the opening declaration of YMCA towards the Commission was also inaccurate in claiming that “ there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which YMCA was recognised as the forefront of child safety . ”	-4.8259
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.2404
Hare , who started with 21 on YMCA , acknowledged that the management had “ failed from me to downward ” in the attitude of Lord and did not ensure that staff were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety directives .	-5.1074
At the beginning of the year , Lord condemned twelve boys during his two-year activity for YMCA .	-3.0418
He was condemned to at least six years of prison .	-1.9752
Hare died , however , that the YMCA had a cultural problem that had held employees from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety .	-3.6441
The employees said that they had observed infringements , among other things that Lord was alone with children , serving them privately as a babysitter , they sitting on his shot , to a say that he loved it and played children with his mobile ph .	-5.1708
Danielle Ockwell , whose leader Lord was and who had asked for a training of child protection because she was concerned about his behavior , said that child service manager Jacqui Barnat , who was the presented Lords , “ very intimidating and most of them very unacceptable . ”	-4.7739
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have trusted to report their presentation .	-3.7549
Instead , he said , have rather affected their friendship with Lord their judgment , which is why they would not have reported him .	-3.3580
Hare explained that he told the Board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson to draw the organization from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” was “ not the reporting ” by employees , and the Board agreed to him .	-5.4378
Hare said that the decision to urge the employees to sign secrecy obligations briefly after the accusations occurred was made by the managing director of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-3.8174
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence , but what has been “ excessive ” and badly implemented .	-3.3109
The YMCA NSW was at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed between 2009 and 2011 , no secure organization for children , Professor Stephen Smallbone declared Smallbone from Griffith University , experts for sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-3.7223
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in the attitude , review , editing , training and supervision of employees .	-3.0828

Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided speaking about British policy , and his comments usually restrict foreign policy and his role as the Quartet of Peacekeepers in the Middle East .	-4.0232
The question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s Office was quoted by the Evening Standard from London in words : “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this happens , that is .. ”	-3.6594

But nobody was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-3.0550
The Knirps , which has not even been in the kindergarten and only a few months ago took his first steps and his Shetland Pony toffee bore loosely through the three rounds and got the first prize – with 30 adult opponents behind themselves .	-5.1207
The unseparate couple , both of which are similar , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-4.0194
In his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had established his cap in a frequent angle and led the two years old potatoes through the ring .	-4.1442
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities to deal with the pony that were far above his age .	-3.5120
And materials received customs for his appearance and his personality .	-3.0416
Fenton had given materials last March as a gift to his third birthday and had practiced the Shetland Pony every day since .	-3.7315
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and potatoes are a great spirit . ”	-2.4896
They had to oppose the entire participant field and have gone from the square with gold pocal and rosette .	-3.4828
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with potatoes , and we were all enthusiastic when he wo      w wo .	-2.9642
Perfect strangers in the Arena considered him to be so phenomenal that they would like to be photographed with him .	-3.4914
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his tante Sharon Howells , which has been horses for over ten years .	-3.2686
Howells told : “ The whole audience was like electricity and all fired it and clamped it . ”	-3.0850
He was on sand the whole length of the Arena and , although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-3.5242
Fenton is crazy to animals – he loves horses , tractors , and farms and has two chickens to care .	-3.1602
As he started , it will not take long before he is on the “ horse of the Year ” – and I am sure he will cut off well .	-4.6342
A spokesman of the annual horseshow said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.7749
They are a great team together .	-1.6471
The jurors evaluated fenton and potatoes after how well they would have been beaten and presented in the speed .	-3.6032
They respect good cooperation between Pony and leaders – and there were Fenton and Toffee the best in ring .	-3.0170
I am sure that Fentons sweet clothing has contributed to this , the really perfect occasion .	-3.1728
Chinese Newspaper is to be “ reformed ”	-1.8469
A Chinese newspaper , which had called for the release of a reporter charged for diffaming , should be reformed , explained a press regulator .	-3.2240
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.5002
But Chen later admitted that he adopted bribe money to false reports on a partial company .	-2.9365
Now the New Express has been subject to a “ comprehensive rectification , ” the Regulatory Authority explained .	-3.6276
The “ Rectification Order ” took place from the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and TV in Guangdong .	-2.7872
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which is one of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several unacceptable reports on the Zoomlion listed company between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-3.4190
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disordered , ” announced the Regulatory Authority in a declaration .	-2.8059
She said that it was decided to impose “ an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and escape his reporter licence . ”	-3.1190
Moreover , “ Yangcheng Evening News Group needed to make full rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant responsible for the New Express be identified and immediately reviewed the New Express ’ leadership team . ”	-3.9023
Chen wrote several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called zoomlion .	-3.0331
After he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and put behind his journalist work .	-2.7202
Then , however , Chen published in state television and admitted that he had published wrong reports against paymen .	-4.9569
“ In this case , I have damaged zoomlion as well as the whole news industry and its ability to win the public ’ s confidence , ” he said to the CCTV state news channel .	-3.7413
I have done it first and foremost because I was famed for money and fame .	-2.6412
I have become clear that I have traded wrong .	-3.4406
Following Chen ’ s apologies , the New Express published an excuse on the front page and explained that it was failed to check the reports correctly .	-6.8180
Several well-known suspects have recently taken concerns on TV .	-3.5429
Experts say that conclusions are still being forced routinely , despite an amendment to the legislation at the beginning of the year in which the authorities have been prohibited to force someone to accuse themselves  .     T '         	-4.5232
Drug tunnel with its own railways between the US and Mexico	-2.0097
One of the most refined tunnels for the drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was completely equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric operation , has now been discovered .	-3.2968
The American authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres measuring tunnels as one of the most filed passages they ever found .	-3.1445
The tunnel , which runs in the zick pattern over a length of just six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.3826
In the area there are countless unseemless storage halls , which makes it easier to hide with drugs loaded trucks .	-3.0629
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported into it , the authorities explained .	-2.4292
In the discovery of the tunnel , eighth-and-a-half tonnes of Marihuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine have been ensured , the records of the court .	-3.6153
Three men who , according to the statement of the authorities , were accused of the possession and the intended sales of Marihuana and Cocaine .	-3.1315
They are threatening prison sentences for ten years and life long .	-4.1734
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers bet on an extensive underground network of dewater channels .	-2.6374
The tunnel is the eighth big passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-1.8772
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marihuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which presents the challenge of the drugs cartels as they can quickly bring their product to the consumers .	-4.8901
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 metres long passage with rails that were granted from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .	-4.0253

In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not run just as we plan or hope " .	-4.0352
Kerr and he himself still loved , emphasized the 36 years .	-3.1008
" We will support each other and love as parents of Flynn " .	-2.0693
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 her Sonchen Flynn was born .	-2.6274
Veganism , according to Lexica , is different from vegetarianism , but it is very different .	-3.0994
While vegetarians allow the consumption of sahnets , ice or a strong edam , these worships are not on the menu of a vegan .	-3.6845
Milk , cheese , egg , next to the renunciation of meat and fish , the vegan leaves from all consumption of animal products - honey is also united .	-4.6035
What remains , we may wonder , but the vegan nutritional world is characterised by a considerable incident .	-3.8499
" Bread records are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , who provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-3.6528
Reuben Proctor also will be happy to visit the shops in the domestic  s .	-3.1742
For 13 years , the birthplace of the New Zealands has been vegan , in Lampertheim ( almost ) finding everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I presented my diet and became vegetarians " .	-4.3035
Around the turn of the century then took the next step and I became vegans .	-2.5460
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the shoe election " , says Proctor , the art leather prefers normal leather .	-3.6154
He recognized that in other day-to-day concerns without animal products .	-2.9577
First and foremost , vegan is an ethical . T              	-4.0512
" I do not want animals to die for me " , Proctor speaks out the maxims of the vegans that extend to the entire consumer behavior .	-3.0440
Instead of trusting burgers , stirrers or rubbers , the vegan quickly discovered new products that rise enthusiasm .	-3.6879
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " indeed vegan does not renounce any ascess , but it is an enrichment " .	-6.6285
And precisely these conditioning could some attempts to fail .	-3.7483
" The addictive factor is a very important factor that many quickly abandons , similar to smoking , " presents a comparison .	-3.7463
And applies : " Certain tastes are not at animals " .	-2.9260
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste .	-2.5054
" You can also create the same effect in other ways " , illustrates the vegan .	-2.8474
Proctor , for example , brings excavators , champignons and also a few vegan sausages .	-4.5182
It respects a balanced , varied diet , where it is absolutely definitely tasteful .	-3.9982
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.2276
" It is to taste , but this is not only to reduce animal food " , said Proctor .	-2.8980
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , has not suffered .	-2.2650
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.1655
I do not accept a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share .	-2.3841
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan .	-3.0744
" My blood values are excellent , I often check " , betrayed Proctor .	-2.4350
In particular , before the lack of vitamin B12 , many vegansimus critics warn .	-1.9919
" Since animals are nurtured with feedingstuffs rather than grassing , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator , the vitamin B12 share is high " , Proctor find .	-4.0727
For vegans there is also the opportunity to take the coenzym in the form of tablets .	-2.6233
" My B12 values are in order " , he explains .	-2.0684
Far ways must not go to Proctor for food procure .	-2.9043
After all , basic food is everywhere and every supermarket has soya milk and other products .	-3.3761
All I need is on the ground .	-1.8225
Only do I buy something special .	-2.6282
" Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive , but thus it is known as " ordinary " products .	-3.6729
In any case , the preparation of vegan courts is much more favourable and less time-consuming than accepted . Th s a c  .	-4.9540
" In the housekitchen there is much to discover , with some small kniffs you can be good if not partly achieved better results " , says Proctor .	-3.9592
Margarine instead of butter , something more backpowder and carbon acid instead of egg , with his vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring his representatives to stauna .	-4.8132
Family festivals give the vegan a new source .	-2.4626
This has a new importance if you cook together .	-2.5695
" The situations that can emerge are as different as the people themselves " says Proctor .	-2.2231
Of course , he has already been scepticised .   H w h w w h h w  h w w h h w 	-11.7192
Do you not taste my food anymore ?	-2.1709
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - when it comes to such questions you have to operate as a vegan with finger sense .	-4.6736
" I do not reject people , I am part of this society " , Proctor does not want an enclave dash .	-3.2670
And , more precisely , the everyday world does not appear as much suspected as suspected - and the vegan does not restrict the limits of everyday life as commonly accepted .	-5.1647
Fast Food is also allowed .	-1.4015
Pommes everywhere !	-1.3885
" Many donations offer Falafel , or precisely a vegetarian Yufka " , says Proctor .	-2.5222
In a pizzeria he displays pastage dishes or orders a pizza without cheese , all a question of habit .	-3.9934
The restaurants are so slow about it .	-2.7277
" When I started 13 years ago to feed me vegan , everything was much more difficult " , the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people who draw them attention to it " .	-3.7638
" If enough demands come , they may be tended to complement the menu card " , he hopes .	-4.0252
Vegan restaurants develop , such as combustions in Mannheim or Café Vogelfrei .	-2.4004
Proctor has the desire that other restaurants have at least a vegan court on the menu .	-2.5168
Basically , vegan dishes are there for everyone .  T '         	-3.2153
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.0432
" Meat dishes are exclusive against this , in the true sense of the word , because they close others , " sets Proctor .	-3.4678
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the very largest part of the outset impossible " , Proctor says .	-3.1010
The purchase of vegan products can be somewhat difficult at the beginning .	-2.2485
In particular , when you learn to understand what can also be included in earthnities of animal additives as color donors , you seem to leave the courage quickly with the following of ethics in so many obstacles and traps .                  	-5.1388
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that also have food and cleaning .	-7.3041
" Afterwards you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to respect " It is sometimes better small steps to be taken than standing or stumbling " , white proctor .	-4.0369
Veganism , it is an important moral fingerpoint that beats awareness .	-2.5360
Perhaps he does not quite create his habits , but at least he can teach consumers critically to question his habits .	-3.4894

Tax for foreign property owners against London ’ s speculation bubble	-2.2345
The Finance Ministry has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but it is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a 7 % tax in the 2012 budget on apartments that cost over two million pounds , and keep annual charges for buyers who keep apartments as company and not as individuals .	-4.7617
Already , the revenues from the tax on housing ownership in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which were in the fiscal year 2012 / 13 at 708 million pounds , combined revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , North-East , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-4.5361
Cook said : “ After the increases in the tax on high-price apartments and the introduction of the legislation against them , one can hardly claim that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the obsolete community tax system . ”	-4.1953

Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist of the University of Trient , said : “ Human beings are well known that the left and right brain half differ from responding to Stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.7726
Here we have tried to look at this in other species                      	-2.9421
He also noted that in dogs , just like humans , the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-3.6732
To learn more about how dogs responded to the sidelines of their species , researchers monitored animals , while these films of other dogs looked .	-4.1015
They measure the heart frequency of the four-being and analyzed the behavior .	-2.6786
Probably we will soon understand why the tail moves in one time in the other direction .	-3.1667
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distractive other aspects , and we could control the movement of the tail more towar the l   or t right . ”	-3.7745
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressless dog has moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the dog ) , they remain completely relaxed .	-3.8693
But the tail was primarily to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the dog ) , so their heart frequency rose , and they saw unquiet .	-5.5613
In the view of Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not deliberately communicate through these movements .	-2.5166
It is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience in which movements they should worry and when not .	-2.8912
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the tail is rather linked with friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior , then you respond based on these experiences . ”	-4.7280
Researchers say that the findings of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help them better understand the emotions of their an an     a bet .           	-4.2683
John Bradshaw , expert for dog behaviour and host scholarship at the Faculty of Animal Health Clients of the University of Bristol , declared that this was not the first study when investigated whether left and right is important for dogs .	-4.7186
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found that dogs turned the head left when they look at an aggressive dog , and after the right thing is a satisfied dog .	-3.7923
In another research work at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs go rather to a robot dog when being , tail ‘ left and not become right , rather than becoming unconcerned – exactly than in the Italian study . ”	-5.0955
According to his statement , the differences could therefore stem from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in the films or the robot dogs a   d  .	-4.3473
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help he explained .	-4.3105
“ While there are considerable evidence for many different sucking animals that the two brain half are used for different purposes , many of them have to be determined – and dogs do not form any exception , ” said Bradshaw .	-4.9109
Since their behavior can be recorded simply , it will probably not take a long time until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one , sometimes in the other direction .	-4.0789
Arctic Monkeys moved performance in Glasgow for the disease Alex Turners	-2.3901
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved a performance in Glasgow after its lead singer is diseased for coal head inflam       .	-4.2404
The band from Sheffield should play in Hydro on Friday .	-2.5432
However , because of the disease of the leadsinger Alex Turner , the concert must now be transferred .	-3.4214
The announcement of the band came after previously moving a performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-3.1687
In a declaration on its official website , the Arctic Monkeys shared : “ After the decision to remove the show in the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening and at medical council , the Arctic Monkeys must also remove the show in Glasgow on Friday 1 November . ”	-4.3783
“ Alex Turner has diagnosed a cap inflammation , which is why he unfortunately cannot occur . ”	-3.8897

Pope Francis Called First Cardinals	-2.0459
On 22 February , Pope Francis will call for the first time new cardinals of the Catholic Church , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.0995
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also the Pope who choose a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-3.7768
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.2530
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 cannot participate in the popular election – which is a group of 120 “ electoral cardinals . ”	-3.7684
In an explanation announced the message , Pater Federico Lombardi , a spokesperson of the Vatican , will take place a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony will be held to appoint the new cardinals , which is also known as a consistor .	-4.1601
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce its decision to convene the consister in February in advance so that other meetings that require participation of cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-3.3458
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of electoral cardinals would probably decline until February .	-2.4208
He said that a Pope usually appointed as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of electoral cardinals are 120 again , and so many cardinals over 80 , as he wants .	-3.4529
The consistor was therefore important next year because it was the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Valero .	-3.0710
There is currently a certain overhang from Europe , and Italy in particular .	-3.9616
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.9614
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they only have a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.0233
The cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the education of the French Council of Cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world , who have the mission to find opportunities to reform the Church .	-4.3619
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.9298
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.1796
He said that it was “ good possible ” that Francis please the Cardinals for Council .	-2.7560
But , so far , we have not been in this situation – all is new .	-2.9505
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called to cardinals , but Francis is “ full of surprises – we do not know whom he appoints .  ”	-3.3910
GM returns new pickup trucks in the US to repair the seat length	-6.7219
General Motors called for nearly 19,000 its brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks with building year 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat length , such a communication by the US American Regulatory Authority for Vehicle Safety on Friday .	-4.5419
For some of the cars , there can be a defect in the mechanism for the restoration of the front len .	-3.3381
That is why they do not meet the Federal Guidelines for the Safety of Vehicles in their heads .	-3.4023
“ When from behind on the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraints do not properly protect the occupations , so that there is an increased injury risk , ” was in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-4.1274
The returned models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.0722
The delivery of the GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since insolvency-related restructuring in 2009 .	-3.0840
GM informed the vehicle owner in the first Octoberhalf about the defect .	-2.1084
The NHTSA could not check the notification letter because of the 16-day government shutdown , which has had a negative effect on car sales in October .	-3.8819
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks developed for the 2014 model was rising by 20 % on Friday in the first ten months of the year .	-3.1767
In October , GM 42.660 Silverado- and 16.503 Sierra-Pickup-Trucks sold .	-1.9034

Despair of an Obama electorate	-2.2336

Obama ’ s Memoirs on the 2008 election campaign were a sad memory of what would have been possible .	-3.1973
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-2.0763
I currently read a terribly sad book .	-2.0257
It is a book which I believed that it would carry me out during the trubbing second year of my medical study and give me hope again .	-4.1419
It means “ The Audacity to Win ” ( Courage ) and puts the Memoirs of Barack Obama into the presidential election in 2008 .	-3.8582
When I am ready and go to bed with my patient broadcasting evenings , the book will lead back to a time when politics inspired millions and rob a speech .	-4.4698
The election became a global victory and message speaker held in order to see the historical importance of this hour .	-4.1799
My class camerades went before joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-2.5069
A young team of visionaries was on the road to the White House and the Nation was ready for change .	-2.2162
When Obama changed into office then in 2008 , he had approval values of 82 % .	-2.5531
And then I close the book .	-1.2549
Reswitching to the present is an evil awakening as if you are torn out of a dream .	-3.7358
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague remembrance , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-4.7066
In the years , for the first time I voted for the first time , something has actually changed .    T  'P '  w  is           	-5.7046
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-1.6521
I recognise the great and versatile things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for health insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .                      	-3.8314
I also believe that the party political block adetactics have tightened too many efforts with which our nation should be brought forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closing of Guantanamo Bay , to name just a few .	-4.4816
But after I defended the Obama administration towards colleagues and familiar colleagues , I have come to an end with my statement  .	-3.8084
I have reached one point of political despair .	-1.7275
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why the listening of foreign leaders or killing innocent children by drones in overseas .	-2.8936
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about the private life of Americans , and why whistleblowers are punished to disclose government misconduct .	-3.4455
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , has been murdered without procedures , and why public financing and expenditure limits are dealt with during the presidential elections .	-3.4491
It does not justify the results of a report in which it states that the White House 's efforts to calm the media are the most aggressive ... since the Nixon government .	-3.5803
And recently , it cannot apologise for the inability to design a simple website in the over three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.5874
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected .	-1.5189
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaign  .	-2.7588
Obviously , the Members ' Office is not a predictable course because an opposition party and random events such as the newtown massacre shape public debate .	-3.4117
But when I look at the examples above , they seem largely elected by the government itself .	-2.7395
And that disturbs me most .	-1.9815
I chose Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.3627
With Romney , a confusing and unbalanced alternative seemed to be unable to set his direction and positions .	-2.8786
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we had heard so long .	-6.5652
But , with the decline in the approval values for Obama to below 45 % this week , the return has become so harder by this book in 2008 .	-3.3930
It raises the desire for the many promises that have dissolved into air .	-3.2580
This week I read a section in the book describing how Obama has had to discover a serious loss against Clinton in the pre-elections in Pennsylvania .	-3.1802
In a meeting with the electorates after the decision , he said his employees that they would have to come back to course and follow the purpose of their m                	-3.9201

The mining magnate , which is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax , claimed when he wanted to ask whether he was in a conflict .	-3.6394
The Palm United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for the decision whether CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or cut .	-2.9828
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and would personally benefit the daughters of Abbott .	-3.3165
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters is pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether they receive holidays or not , ” said Palmer .	-3.7694
Two months after the election , the Palmer election commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast Seat of Fairfax with 53 votes after the recount .	-3.5797

RBS Suspends Two Foreign  T Dealers	-4.4962
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from their foreign exchange department , such as two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication of the global authority investigation into the alleged manipulations of the monetary market . The Royal Bank of Scotland has t    s suspended two dealers o f	-5.8917
Some of the world ’ s biggest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they worked with the authorities in the global financial market investigations which change owners of $ 5.3 billion every day .	-3.7484
The two dealers would be the first RBS employees , who were suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal around the liborary interbanking business h   i i  .	-4.4523
The Bank , which did not comment on suspending , confirmed this month that they received information requests from authorities .	-2.5400
“ Our investigations on this issue go further and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-2.7621
Last month , the situation stated that the RBS passed the records of emails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier dealer to the British supervisory authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-3.6046
This dealer , Richard Usher , had left the RBS 2010 and should now have been rejected by his current position as a European head of the Forex spot trade in JPMorgan .	-3.9852
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading at Citi , was released this week and Matt Gardiner , earlier leading currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.5427
None of these dealers have been accused of any misconduct .	-1.9719
The Instant Message Group of Usher belonged to Barclays and Citigroup , said the situation nearby people .	-2.7581
UBS announced this week that she had taken steps against some of her employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had stated that she examined an alleged manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-3.6963
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Ministry of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with charges that bankers should have discussed transactions in the monetary market .	-3.6408
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also received internal investigations or received information requests from authorities said the situation familiar persons .	-3.1222
Banks combat Instant Messages and Emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-2.9103
The news on these investigations has enabled traders in an area which has heard one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but was under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .	-4.0466
Some bankers have tried to downgrade the affair and said that it was almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading dealers believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.1186
A leading dealer noted that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trade , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to “ influencing the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-3.9723
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had announced a dealer of her London Exchange Traded Funds offices this week after he caused a loss of almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-3.4733
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and works with them .	-1.9631
“ We are sure that the dealer has acted alone and that the matter is contained , ” explained Credit Suisse .	-2.7917

In these villages , free medical care is really one reason for celebrating and waving – with its broad smiles and its borderless energy – will be happy to celebrate them  . This  i is a  s cel w . This i is a g o t to t t the p .	-10.7899
The next morning the team will then start with the investigation of hundreds of patients .	-2.3664
" Per journey we treat 500 people " , said bwave .	-2.9002
They come from a range of 60 kilometres around the village – and that on foot .	-3.0637
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-1.9640
Many people are treated because of malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-2.1930
Other cruises , donated glasses or free birth surcharges – a document necessary for school but simply cannot afford many poor families .	-3.1761
In the evening , the team executes simple operations with local stunning .	-2.9340
The operations typically take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the intervention the patients are and go into the recreational area to make space for the next .	-4.1490
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the group generator , so working bwaves and its volunteers to the early morning hours on Sunday .	-3.7268
It is an effortless pensum , but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .                 	-3.3992
“ They drums the whole night so that we can stay wake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-2.9905
On Sunday the team then returns to the city , tired , but proud of the work that has been done .	-2.9401
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical instudents – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with their work , it has a huge difference for the people that  h   h helps i .	-3.6524
A man explained that the free operation of a breakthrough that he had received made it possible to work again .	-3.0262
“ That changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.9467
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-3.6477
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , so Bwelle ; the rest comes from private donations .	-2.9652
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says catie O 'Malley , who studies at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and works voluntarily in Bwelles Group .	-3.4098
It is always either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so that it can go to these campaigns .                                 	-4.8018
For medical and health care students such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe , this is an opportunity to gather practical experience they would never get at home .	-3.1947
" We can be at operations where we help to close blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle " , explains O 'Malley .	-3.6708
That would never be possible in America as a medical instudent in the second year .	-1.7651
The students typically pay their journey to Cameroon typically and often bring donated sanitation material . The stu  h           	-4.5238
But if they are only in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over accommodation , transport and guidance .	-3.8579
“ He is without doubt a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-1.9459
He devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no borders .	-2.4608
For Bwelle , nearly constant work is not a burden .	-2.5026
Others will help happier life , thereby meeting a promise he has given to his father , prepares him great joy .	-4.1786
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-2.6178
And I think of my father .	-1.2115
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.3684
I do it to bring people back to laugh and relieve pain .	-2.7454

The role of the Santiago , the old man in Hemingway ’ s novelle " The Old Man and the Sea " , is Horst Janson cut on the body     .      T                    	-3.7853
Janson is himself an old hare in his meticulous actress .	-4.7757
The old man Santiago cannot make anyone something about fishing .	-3.7528
That is how the two simply complement themselves .	-2.7918
It is almost believed to be able to see the wrinkles in the nake of the old man , of whom the fishing young Manolo speaks .	-3.9269
If Santiago is tired of life on the chair , that is real at Janson .	-2.4096
In addition , the role of old fishermen is through and through a character role that Janson excellently masters .	-2.8567
Hemingway told the history of a fighter , a courageous man who did not give up and ultimately wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and also his willingness .	-3.6295
Janson is a sole player on the stage in mu routes .	-3.4139
He manages to focus the attention of the audience , so his monologists are not boring a moment .	-3.1500
Its efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists of only blue water bottles .	-4.4127
Director Jens Hasselmann leaves the old man in the boat before the fishing village .	-2.2302
During the performance he sets the active scene into light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Favour , which defeats Cuba 's life with her songs and her beautiful voice .	-4.6226

Tourism : Descending to the Roman Rive   .	-2.5930
On around 120 metres length , a sewer channel is received from the Roman time below Cologne .	-3.9728
Those who visit Cologne are not over .	-2.7520
Around 157 meters rain the two towers in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-2.9907
But only a few visitors who are stunning the two filigrant churches say that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-3.8225
Rainer Schulze is expert in Cologne Unterworld .	-2.0919
The Cologne Tourism Service Centre is a meeting place for its guided tours .	-2.8492
The tour starts very unspectacular : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-2.7796
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted to see a car , and that is why the remains of the old city walls were only that , which was not too great .	-4.3427
Most users of the parking house therefore also pass the Roman remains today and only pass their car .	-3.8091
But who looks more precisely in the Parkdeck D2 discovers an archaeological foundation separated by metal gitters                   	-4.1875
There are about five metres of high ruins from trader large stones .	-3.7019
" There are remains of the Roman city wall built in the second half of the first century to Christ " , told Schulze .	-3.2496
Before going back to the daylight , Schulze leaves participants at the upper parking level a glimpse of a dark , 15 meters deep check .	-4.2737
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly perceived .	-3.2466
The next station of the tour is the pretorium , and the participants are rising down to the depth .	-3.5765
We are experiencing the headquarters of the once-powerful man north of the Alps , the pretor of the CCAA .	-2.9744
What CCAA means wants to know a visitor .	-2.1082
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means as much as " the city of Roman law and the city of the Agrippiness , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the Altar for the Emperor Cult " .	-4.2155
And the Pretorium is the former Palace of State , the Roman Empire ’ s Power Centre on the Rhine .	-3.1509
From the advantage of the exhibition , tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is received here around 120 metres long .	-3.7501
" You can go a quiet piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want " , Schulze munters the guests .	-3.3585
A surprise has school .	-1.6827
After having collected the key at the cash , he leads the group to a 16-meter deep , common box .	-4.2862
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath " , he explains .	-2.0032
The Jewish community built its bath deeply in the soil to come to the groundwater , which was essential for ritual washings .	-3.1013
To this day , in the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins are declining until the eighth century , different waterstands can be read by changing levels of the Rhine .	-4.4606
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone in the City Hall Square for which the construction work is shortly beginning .	-4.2082
But there will be a few years until the completion of  t   .	-3.4913

The Public Prosecutor presents them , in June 2009 , together with unknown complices in Finowfurt , to three men in one car and to take them .                               	-5.0338
All victims have been hard to injure , a man would have lost almost his leg .	-2.5567
The victims should have listened to the competitive group of Hell Angels .	-2.5023
One should have been a high-level member of Berlin .	-1.8147
Apparently , a persecution hunt with several cars was apparently h .	-3.4180
According to the charge , it was about struggles and a power demonstration .	-3.2507
The two charges were accused of a first procedure in early 2012 .	-3.1257
A judicial speaker said then that it could not be proved that men were actually involved in the bloody arrest .	-3.3019
The perpetrators had born masks and were not recognized .	-1.9603
The Federal Court highlighted the ruling after the revision of the Prosecutor 's Public Prosecutor and referred to the Court of Justice for the renegotiation .             	-4.4656
One of the accused is currently because of another delicate in open enforcement .	-2.6107

But on the homeway the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco gangers are noticeable .	-3.2575

Particularly on the weekends there are raised paper bulbs on street edges and parking spac .	-5.4312

Are people too doof to take the bags with home respective to the next rubbe    ?	-5.1124
It is not just the case that paper products negotiate the landscape .	-2.2507
Transport facilities , such as guide planks , have also covered accidents .	-6.2196
What is thinking about what is thinking about ' company ' , probably it does not even know what this word really means .	-4.5935
If you are more on the road on the evening , you can only look with several people in the car , which a return bank can look like after celebrated nights : bottles , bottles and other waste towers there .	-6.4620
There would make a few boots more or less nix as well - unlike the road , where no one wants to trample on the food rest of others .	-4.8419
I am already seeing the day when the cities and communities will have to blood the space - and the fast food chains must be required for their battles .	-4.5623
Obama ’ s Health Policy	-3.9692
After strong criticism , President Obama made a withdrawer yesterday in his often repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep them . ”	-3.6543
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers have received a letter of termination , the Republicans presided over the past few days , he has deceived the American public .	-3.4330
Yesterday , Obama relativated its original promise .	-2.7083
“ The overwhelming majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said at a speech in Boston .	-2.7404
As a response to the numerous media reports on terms , Obama called on the Americans who have received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance .	-4.0596
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance for the same price or more cheaply than forecast .	-5.0296
“ You come a better offer , ” he said .	-1.8911
The government called it little surprise that the five percent of the population , who have completed insurance themselves , would have to look after another rate , because their Treaty did not meet the new standards after the Affordable Care Act .	-4.3728
“ I would like to say quite directly to these Americans : they deserve better , ” said Sebelius in a hearing before the Committee on Energy and Trade in the House of Representatives in Washington .	-3.7857
Sebelius , responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , stated that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-2.7039
“ I am as frustrated and angry as all others , ” she said .	-2.4469
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.4030
This expression of a Sebelius launched behind their seated adviser at the House of Representatives yesterday was included after a dispute conversation with the Republican Member Billy Long from Missouri , whether they were obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-4.8479
After more than three hours of consultation , Long Sebelius repeatedly reformed the question of why the “ architect ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily renounce a state-encouraged insurance to complete a fare at HealthCare.gov that they want to sell millions of Americans .	-4.1035
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air bases	-2.5753
An American government official that wanted to remain anonymous has claimed on Thursday to the American news channel CNN that Israeli combat aircraft had attacked one day before an air force base in Syrian Latakia .	-4.2015
The objective was ' missiles and equipment ' which the Israeli Government feared that they were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to CNN .	-3.3196
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the support in the port city of Latakia was shot on Thursday during the night of Wednesday , and Israelis made it responsible for this .	-4.5455
The Israeli television channel 2 showed satellite pictures of the base in Latakia , on which Russian defense missiles from the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles , according to Channel 2 , have a reach of 35 kilometres and can transport up to 70 kilograms .	-4.2193
Uncertainty in Jerusalem has officially not confirmed the attack .	-1.9882
However , the Reuter news agency quotes an anonymous Israeli government officials , with the words he believes that Israel has exported the attack , but would not be sure .	-3.8992
At any rate , a spokesman from the Ministry of Israel of Defence said : ' We do not comment on these reports ' .	-3.3781
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime already sooner , partly successfully , tried to deliver ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-5.4158
The Israeli Government had repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means the transcence of a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-3.3790
John Kerry explains in an unprecedented acceptance that the US spy agenda was “ inappropriate too far . ”   John            Ke  	-5.9912
John Kerry indicated , with an unexpected acceptance , a swing of the US ’ s defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by saying that spying was “ inappropriate ” in certain cases .	-4.6049
The Foreign Minister also accepted that he joined Barack Obama together with Barack Obama the responsibility that we have switched to “ Autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public on NSA ’ s spy activities .	-4.6656
Through the information that has been signed , the US government has faced a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .	-3.8403
In a video link to the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said , “ Without question , the President and others in the government experienced some things that have expired quasi by Autopilot simply because the ability to insist on what is still returning to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to 11 September . ”	-5.2844
Afterwards , he was the first high-level member of the US government that the US spy agency had exceeded a border , but also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.1700
He said , “ In some cases , this has gone inappropriatel too far . ”	-2.8803
The President is determined to create clarity and therefore carry out a thorough investigation so that nobody has to feel abused here .	-3.2762
I assure you that the rights of innocent persons are not affected in this process .	-1.9267
Kerry insisted , however , that NSA was a strength of good , and many lives were saved by its monitoring processes .	-3.8363
He added : “ We have a new world to do where people are prepared to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.9368
There is a radical extremism in the world which is forgetting to kill people , blow the air and attack governments .	-2.7459
So what would it be possible to start and stop before it happens ?	-2.8081
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we have learned in the run-up to such plans .	-2.9876
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about the alleged American spying agenda and to convince Europeans of the need to continue to work with the US on Thursday , such as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs .	-4.2546
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke this week with representatives of the European Parliament and other persons and was concerned about their threats no longer involved in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration of the monitoring of the National Security Agency .         t  .  The I   w h  h w h h  w	-6.3233
“ It is very important for US national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who sits for the first time in the Senate and works as chairman of the Senate Sub-Committee on Foreign Relations and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-3.9331
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger about the NSA programmes .	-3.0864
Media reports that NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , although the head of the secret service explained this week that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-3.9299
Other revelations quoted from Snowden documents that the NSA had monitored the phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldw                        	-3.8055
The head of national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended the spying allies as necessary and explained that this was usual on both sides .	-3.1977
In all the Tumult , Murphy said that his authority prepared the journey of the Congress to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation will include members of both parties and chambers .	-3.2441
The names of other participating Members should be published in the coming days .	-2.1489
He said that the exact travel route is still developed .	-2.2410
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of travel is to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-2.5782
He said that European governments should be honest with their population about the type of spy programmes they have used for years .	-3.0740
" While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus protect the rights of Europeans , they must also find themselves with the fact that we are not the only ones who spy , " said Murphy .	-3.5500
Meanwhile , John Kerry stands for a journey in the Middle East and Poland on the weekend to deal with the groll of the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , and US surveillance activities .	-3.8793
A strong violation at the joint joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Federal League Game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg .	-3.8586
Mainz nags for a use of Nicolai Müller .	-2.7071
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.6332
So far he could only be individual .	-2.4696

Australian appeals to Thailand	-4.9297
A 21-year woman from Sydney , who was condemned to 15 days in Phuket because she wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver , has opposed the judgment and was released on deposit .	-3.4753
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was first of all found by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false statement after she had specified the Thai police , a local taxi driver raped them in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June , while two other men stood them .	-5.0076
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she was surely in her hotel after she was separated from her Australian friend .	-4.0510
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until it had stood out of history .	-3.0535
Until the judicial negotiation , she was on the ground in police protection .	-3.1521
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a liability with low security level on the edge of Phukets rather than in a prison for adult women .	-4.6267
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who turned to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for his daughter .	-3.0427
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney , the whole family is “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia .	-3.3369
“ Of course , we are concerned about great concerns , but we hope that it is at home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.2872
Bamford has opposed the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 Baht on free foot .	-3.3353
In Australian reports , it has been read that in the meantime she makes holidays in Krabi in South Thailand .	-3.7414
From the court heard , Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal can also lead to the imposition of a higher penalty of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-3.6731
However , it is also possible that , after the recent murder of the Michelle Smith travel purchase in Phuket , Thailand could be endeavoured to improve its beaten tourist image , and that is why it comes to an exemption .	-4.7623
