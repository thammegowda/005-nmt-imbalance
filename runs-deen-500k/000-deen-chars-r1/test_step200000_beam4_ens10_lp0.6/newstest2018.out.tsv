Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your views over the city	-3.3212
An irritating atmosphere where young people are to meet today .	-3.8262
A called chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now digged .	-2.9617
Small gardeners manage the former reason for farmers .	-2.0015
The oldest official map of Munich promotes exciting stories at days .	-2.0832
It nerves if maps are not current .	-2.7813
This knows everyone who has already had to excursion because the auto-navi instead of an environment street displayed a green meadow .	-4.7207
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian Atlas , an offer of the geoportal Bavarian government ’ s Bavarian government , are all different from the current point of view - but that is why it is very insightful .	-4.8437
Especially if you compare them with current online cards .	-2.0765
Then it will be clear how cities and communities have changed since the nineteenth century in the distribution area of Munich .	-3.1881
The digital Bavarian atlas is a carpet that is not recognized as such .	-3.3193
The great overview card has been installed for cities and communities more detailed cards , so-called urposition sheets .	-7.1932
These were created according to the Bavarian measuring management between 1810 and 1864 and removed the first measurement of Bavaria .	-3.5469
Your client : Napoleon .	-1.8841
Since the spring of 1800 , the French guide occupied Bavaria during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-2.9214
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and gave a topographic inclusion of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-3.0345
Although the French troops with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801 finally deducted : today ’ s neighbours created the idea of a surface-covering Bavarian card .	-4.2790
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to promote the project , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian measuring management .	-3.1440
The urposition sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and is like any other on the website of the Bavarian Landeslibrary . T ' s   a s f t ' .	-5.6139
The comparison of previous today is the most impressive one in the example of the cap c .             	-3.5230
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.2666
An example of this is subsidiary , which is still relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-2.8392
Sendling was appointed 21 years after creating the card , i.e. 1877 , as a Munich district .	-3.2254
Today is submission in the middle of the city .	-2.4708
The houses of Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the current Plinganserstrasse , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the uprising of the Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-3.9097
Where the Western Park is today , you don 't see anything as a field - at first sight : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers : handwritten numbered floring pieces from the so-called " picture " from which the primary tax was derived .	-5.3257
Today , small parcels do not show farmers - but small gardeners of the plant " Land in Sun " .	-3.5086
A large green surface distinguishes north from undersendling .	-2.8213
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the October festival , was actually a meadow in the 19th century , and not a concrete desert .	-4.1325
On the other hand , the historic card gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.1222
In the Au-Haidhausen district you read not only the street name " at the Gasteig " or from the height " On the Fires " - but also in large letters " Irrene Anstalt " .	-4.8318
Yes , here at the Auerfeldstraße you once locked people with madness .	-3.2916
There , in 1858 / 59 , the Munich circular institution " On the Auer Fires " was created .	-4.4248
As of 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig 's II .	-3.3696
" He was progressively for his time and finished , for example , the chain of so-called mistakes .	-3.0278
In addition , he has forbidden the staff to apply violence against the occupations , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Haidhausen , who has dealt with the institution .	-3.9242
For 280 patients initially had been place , then 500 places were expanded .	-3.9478
At some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circulatory institution in Hair 1905 .	-3.4791
There , since 2006 , Isar-Amper-Clinic Munich East has been located , one of the largest psychiatrists in Germany .	-3.4114
On the area of the former Auer Anstalt , young people now meet in the Munich Salesianum .	-3.2691
The order acquired the 1920 building complex and transformed it into a youth home with training companies .	-2.8877
Western lies the football place of the TSV Munich East , east of the 1980                           	-4.0723
In 2015 , the children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built in architectural approach to the Irrenanstalt origin construction , which was destroyed at bombing attacks in World War II .	-4.4256
The Marienplatz was recorded as " Haupt Square " in 1856 , the purchase ingredient was " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-3.4048
The Second World War also brought a crucial change in the heart of Munich .	-2.4006
The bombs of the Allied rise in December 1944 many holes into the city centre .	-3.0181
A great thing has remained - at the Marienhof .	-2.9943
The English Institute , small business houses and a called chapel from the Middle Ages were once at the Marienhof , where this day the preparatory work and on 5th April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn train station was  don .	-5.1495
With the slider , the old Munich card can be compared to the air picture of today - and the hole on the Marienhof .	-3.9819
Civil rights group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-1.5195
The National Association to promote coloured has issued a warning for colourful people traveling to Missouri because of the discriminatory policy and the racist attacks .	-3.3354
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the Federal State of Missouri , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls for Afro-American travellers , visitors and missourians to be paid special attention to the state and to make extreme caution , since a number of questionable , racially based incidents are recently in the whole state and noticed here " , is the opinion of the group .	-6.1148
A recently adopted law of Missouri , which makes people more difficult to win discriminatory complaints , as well as the criminal prosecution authorities of the state aimed disproportionately at minorities , prompted the group to publish travel warning , said NAACP .	-4.0352
" You have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-1.7900
They are maintained because of their skin colour , they are being beaten or killed " , said the President of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Cansas City Star .	-3.7161
" We hear complaints in such frequency that we have not yet heard . "	-2.3471
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .	-2.3428
The group quoted incidents such as racist passages against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man f          T   . Th           	-3.1980
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after having no longer had any petrol during the trip and was taken by the Missouri police into respect without accusing a  crime .	-4.3557
The Council also points to a recent report by the Missouri General Prosecutor 's Office , which shows that black drivers in the government are holding 75 % more often than white .	-3.6971
" The recommendation is that people are aware of themselves and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri ,   sai Chapel  .	-2.6835
" People must be prepared whether they bring deposit money or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-3.4129
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest numbers from the FBI ’ s hate crime report programme , which classified the state in terms of the number of injuries to the 16th rank of the country .	-3.8647
Travel warning is also an answer to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.5512
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) published travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the States had adopted immigration laws that commit local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for immigration violations , which will contribute to further racial profiling .	-3.9135
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure as a response to certain laws and trends within the United States             resp .	-3.2993
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary	-2.1628
The Fischerbacher Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.0894
The CDU Members of Peter White and Kordula Kovac have gained an image on the ground .	-3.3249
At the Schwendemann Family Rechtgrabenhof , representatives of the Fischerbach CDU town association , together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members                       .	-4.3062
Markus Schwendemann granted first insight into his operation , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and also many young animals and houses in five apartments .	-4.0946
The Black Forest Milk is the alternative marketing path for the milk of his cows , such as Swendemann .	-2.9048
Only regional tables are available on the table .	-3.1519
Since he is also Fischerbach ’ s BLHV chairman , he called the withdrawal project as " an elementary important " .	-3.9339
I cannot gain profitable economies on such s     .	-3.9988
The greenland area provides a lot of work , much must be processed with the engine lake .	-3.3852
" We have the terms and conditions to fight with topography " , emphasized Swendem .	-3.0184
In 2003 , he took over parental operation and managed this without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not lead bio-business .	-3.5977
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear that " The community has recognized the importance of the withdrawal project and is happy about leader support " .	-4.6623
Farmers would have to be supported at the expense of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare .	-2.3430
It is hoped that the afforestation of the areas could still be pulled out a while .	-4.0477
" The greatest treasure we have are the people who work in agriculture and thought themselves about how they continue to bring their operation " emphasized the mayor .	-4.0326
Farmers are often in the Criticism	-1.8456
A total of 25 parcels were fenced by 11 participants in 2013 .	-2.6171
The open area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be forested by at least 2023 .	-3.2368
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was promoted over Leader , a quarter the community Fischerbach was born .	-4.0659
Therefore , farmers remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of withdraw .	-4.7505
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences " , explained Swendemann .	-2.4489
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You don 't make a correct job , without farmers and farmers w ' .	-3.4249
Peter White also stated that " Here best food is produced " .	-3.4720
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg allows government promotion of fences .	-2.5805
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.2185
The prerequisite is the presence of a support scheme called by the LPR .	-3.3196
Furthermore , the surface to be found must not be down-manageable ( hanging over 35 percent ) and must be threatened by afforestatio .	-4.7243
For the 2018 Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt , the application of eight participants with 24 parcels that want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .   Ther is  n c  . The fi i	-6.2395
The revenue area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are at more than 112 000 euros .	-3.3095
Is nothing holy ?	-1.1329
Now the White House of Trump is taking up the statue of freedom .	-3.2101
The safest sign of a regime change is if they start to attack the statues .	-2.4118
The Americans appreciate them as well as any other - therefore the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein on Firdo 's place in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.4477
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axt in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president 's proposals to restrict legal immigration to the freedom statue .	-3.4385
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-2.2933
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done it .	-2.1207
But he added their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to his basis .	-3.6498
When Miller Acosta shimped : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the freedom statue is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-3.5473
The poem that you refer to later , which was added and is not part of the original freedom statue .     '	-2.9864
Miller is right , but , as he has put itself , it is not really about history .	-3.0371
It is about the contemporary response to the words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest in the poorest : " Your tires , your poor , / your pushed masses that see themselves freely to breathe / the miserable waste of your rich coasts " .	-4.9346
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " was better to see on our screens .	-2.4977
Miller did not commit to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people in Trump ’ s US are not welcome .	-2.6950
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America .	-2.7528
Lazarus - and their friends who committed to placing their words after their death - knew very well that they were completing high-policy action .	-3.7730
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by presenting the female embodiment of freedom in an exploited classical picture .	-3.2823
Lazarus changed this importance : In its poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one voice .	-2.7679
And she gives himself a very different name : mother of the exiles .	-2.3211
The connection of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.2608
And just like Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people wanted to change this long ago from the r right w  . T                    	-4.2395
The great Rush Limbaugh , a kind of Johannes of the Baptism for the Coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the freedom statue did not invite anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty goes ahead .	-4.4794
It is intended to bear the face of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .	-3.2031
The tickle should not enlighten the way to the United States ' .	-2.4411
Limbaugh has been somewhat unusual here .   T 'P ' i          	-5.2563
The importance of the statue is quite a matter of perception .	-2.1113
The great fantasy of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , but hopeful people who were long and often terrible to the decks of ships .	-3.8608
The true sense is to see the world from the perspective of people looking for refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.7391
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-2.1702
Of course , this is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise .	-2.3458
Their tickles should not enlighten the way , but the hatred that is their only source of power .	-3.5435
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish membership of the team of t      B . B         is    p  .	-4.4116
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the team of Britain	-2.6363
The Director of Light Athletics of the United Kingdom , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championship Cadre will make a massive contribution t   t  t            t .            	-3.9357
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-2.3462
Black believes that ' something specially developed in Scotland ' and the United Kingdom 's light athletics must learn something f t                 	-3.6868
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find it , " said black .	-2.4602
" I speak with people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.3095
Scottish athletes think that it has something to do what they have done .	-1.9391
British Light Athletics : It has something to do what they have done .	-2.0668
And also with the type of the road corner .	-1.9391
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.8108
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal lawyers , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will take Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m distance , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team capital .	-3.8411
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.3270
Her captain speech was incredible , " says Black .	-2.1590
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they lived or trained , went out of the space and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-4.7128
The passion and the real feeling that the Eilidh was quite naturally introduced were great . "	-3.5958
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take at the 400 m hurdles at its fifth world championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 championships are in the British team .	-4.1706
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes to the World Cup has been seven , which was achieved in 1983 and 2015 . T ’ s      s   t ’ s s  a  g 	-6.6428
The Muir Middle Races leads this way and has situated five British and two European records last year .                       	-4.9023
It will participate in the 1,500 metres and 5,000 metres .	-2.2849
Chris O 'Hare , which runs 1,500 meters , is another Scot that should be observed after a great season that contained the victory of the British team trials and the anniversary games .	-3.6963
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot was in the team Lee McConnell  .   T  ' D ' ,   th on t 19 ' ' C	-7.0303
The team captain says that she is ' enormous proud ' to the fact that many of her compatriots belong not only to the team but , in some cases , to the medals and the finals .                                 	-4.7341
" Being the special team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so that it was always a great honour , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , it makes it something very special for me " , she added . "            i w w a s a g . " T . "  I  h w w s a s c .	-7.6629
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team .	-2.0014
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.6927
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podiums .	-2.2246
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-1.7766
Yes , I think she went good .	-1.4643
I have only pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home championship .	-2.7612
It is therefore really important to put forward this home support and benefit from the Olympic Stadium .	-3.9424
I get a second opportunity to go beyond and compete there , and it will simply be a great atmosphere outside there . '	-3.4168
Block critics about Facebook : Don 't apply for a public office if you cannot transfer voters ' units .	-3.3738
The father of our country knew something of bad press .	-1.5854
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long until newspapers beaten him because of everything , from domestic policy to his political principles .	-2.9688
He shimped with criticism , safe .	-2.1696
But he has not brought his critics to sil .	-1.8459
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be accepted - and , thumb and stumble , we are led to sheep . '	-3.6450
This brings me to Maryland about Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.4973
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-2.7208
And the American Civil Liberties Union therefore sued him at the beginning of this week .	-2.4359
The staff of the governor dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.4310
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-1.9249
But it is important .	-0.9341
And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan .	-1.9863
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-2.0411
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation .	-2.9995
Hogan is not a reactionary heat .	-1.0632
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict compliance with the principles .	-2.6461
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect with his voters and play his hairless head of chemotherapy on his side .	-4.3772
Therefore , the blocking of people coming to the side of the governor is a public forum that is called official and employees paid with public tax dollars - unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-3.7274
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesperson Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions and argued that the blocking of comments is nothing more than a moderation .	-3.0725
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or haterful people who swing the slopes online .	-3.1796
The post spoke with some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-1.9152
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur and a parish , not a troll .	-2.8647
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not profane .	-1.7541
The parish quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.1162
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not haterful , but she asked for hate crimes .	-2.4090
" I commented hopefully that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news " , she wrote in the comments area of the news sending " The Post " .	-3.0789
" I do not appreciate this idea , even if a number of people take a position on the same subject , they are disregarded by some more than a so-called collective use , rather than a large group of citizens concerned " .	-4.1072
What the employees of the governor called " concentrated spam attack " would probably call " additional " .	-3.0079
The Facebook era makes it easy to tailor a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.4294
It is much cleaner than in previous times if you had done the same thing that employees were sent to gather and burn newspapers with critical articles or to arrest demonstrators and silence .	-3.8480
But that is what is happening digitally .	-1.9521
Hogan is not the first public official who is criticised for having descended Facebook and other social media .	-3.1709
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.7247
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-1.8595
The Chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County injured the First Amendment , according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-3.0357
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.4939
That should not be so difficult .	-1.5608
At the moment of Washington , the time of the affordable porto had a similar effect like the Internet .	-2.8597
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beaten on his leadership .	-2.9694
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.6029
People using pseudonyms such as " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all the letters of newspapers that Washington 's decisions were made .	-3.5797
Petitions which criticised its position on the Amity Treaty , trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed its office , according to the historical documents collected by the Online Papers of the George Washington Project .	-3.8533
But he did not silence them .	-1.6016
Freedom of expression , difference of opinion and discourse are the basis of our nation .	-3.2759
And true leadership means accepting this .	-1.5106
Ronan Rafferty Hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-2.0650

The memories of last year come back and it was something special for me and my wife Sharon to win here last year .	-4.6632

" It always means a little more when you play at home " , said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.3391

Less dead of lung cancer through passive smoking	-2.1621
Over the past two decades , fewer people have died of lung cancer for passive smoking .	-2.2881
To this end , scientists of the University Clinic Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) come in a study .	-2.9339
" According to our estimates 167 deaths of lung cancer are due to passive smoking per year , " said Heiko Becher study lea .	-3.2275

Elon Musk is no matter : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order	-2.4454
Electro-Thousandsassa Elon Musk will be happy to give you the huge number of preorders for its new tesla " Model 3 " .	-3.4196
He has so far suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-3.0171
In addition to the triumphant numbers of revenue increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla-Chef Elon Musk has for the first time been able to receive a different , less shining number : cancellations in the new mass market model 3 .	-5.3236
In recent months , Musk had often purchased the more than 500,000 preorders for the new car whose delivery starts .	-4.5738
Now Musk acknowledges : Of the overall 518,000 preorders , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-3.3582
Critics had always pointed out that they are only non-binding reservations .	-2.4813
In case of cancellation , Tesla pays the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and 1000 pound in the United Kingdom ) " Reservation De   " ful .	-3.9077
At present , 455,000 such non-binding reservations have been presented , Musk cleared in a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.6245
But the Tesla chief does not believe that cancellation of around 12 % of all orders could become a problem .	-4.0282
His argument : the challenge in the ambitious growth targets is not on demand but on the production page .	-2.7015
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.7638
In 2018 , all the models merged - 500,000 be , one million in 2020 .	-3.5761
The demand for this is obviously there .	-1.9102
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are currently booked per day .	-2.6501
Today who orders a " model 3 " may earlier expect the extradition in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its nail new production streets even in practice without greater interruptions with a ma        o m .	-4.7688
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.3959
But if there is greater delay , then the non-binding of reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-3.0271
Because the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running in shares .	-3.0310
EPA-Chief Pruitt is retreating for the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions because of the d   ’   e ’ l  d ’  e . ’ Th           	-8.3924
One day after he was sued by 15 countries , Scott Pruitt , the leader of the Environmental Protection Agency , returned his former decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of causing air pollutants .	-3.6410
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to be the needs of government environmental authorities towards reaction faster than previous administrations .	-3.4353
He did not mention the complaint that was raised against his previous place in a Federal Appeal Court .	-2.7894
This is about a deadline that was delivered on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for close ozone .	-4.3504
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid " interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth " .	-3.2875
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s Prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment , was long a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection rules .	-3.2979
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly transferred to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .	-3.0612
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.4105
Last month , a Federal Appeal Court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration , the oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methanecks                                                       o t	-4.9137
In a position published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his turn on ozone standards simply increased the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states by the complex process of meeting the new standards in  good time .	-4.1591
" Under previous administrations , the EPA often did not respect the deadlines for implementation and then waited for them to be charged by activist groups and others , and to determine the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , which sued the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job .	-4.1971

EPA reverses decision to delay the smog rule after complaints	-2.4011
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration that states have been committed to containing smog-causing emissions , one day after 15 countries sued the agency because of the step .	-4.3354
The EPA late announced the decision to promote the so-called ' ozone provisions for 2015 ' , and said that it showed the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-3.3286
" We believe in dialogue and believe that we respond to our state partners " , said EPA-Chief Scott Pruitt in a declaration .	-2.6735
In June , Pruitt announced the EPA 's intention to determine the ozone provisions - in which pollutant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts must be made to meet stricter air quality standards - to delay a year by October 2018 .	-4.1103

The Council of Municipalities	-1.9301
At the end of the decision was clear : in two opposite the Council of Fluorn Winzeln decides to establish a Community area in the future senior housing .	-5.4602
Before discussing , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the still lack of property is signed , the Mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports .	-3.5148
While it will take until the community 's community community has been owned , there is no longer any obstacle to the project to be planned by a private investor .	-4.7610
There is a discussion on a Community space    f             	-3.0864
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to come across the community .	-2.9340
On the ground floor he would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with 70 square meters area for a special price .	-3.5682
The administration and majority of the Council of Municipal Communities are floating not just as a meeting place for the inhabitants of the senior housing , but openly into the community .	-4.0892
As an example , the word of the " strickcafé " made the round .	-2.3458
The decision which has already been decided last autumn by providing resources for the current budget is sweetened by support opp .	-4.0058
The construction is in the refurbishment area .	-1.9846
The establishment of a Community area would be , therefore , reports Tjaden , with 60 % of 3 % .	-3.4948
The decision-making proposal is to signal the investor that in this respect , it would not want to raise a connection between the legs , state that both saddle and environmental construction would be possible , as well as pultroof , which reduces the staircase and makes the construction of the economy possible .	-6.4033
Unnecessary , not only is Wilfried Sohmer , be this addition .	-2.1790
When 's helps : unanimously he happens the body .	-2.4544

Daniela Reputation refers to the many of his own buildings with which we are not going ahead , for which we are now rejecting themselves from the Community area , she says : ' I am doing myself hard with it ' .	-5.3139
Yvonne Staiger is essential for the Community area , but it is absolutely opposed to local participation .	-2.6643
It looks behind a hidden subsidy of already assets or even foreign investors .	-2.7013
That is not the case , because the acquisition of the surface does not give any subsidy , but rather get a real , doubtfully marketable current value , is the counter-speech .	-4.8176
Staiger ’ s request to split the decision accordingly with three advocates .	-3.2124
For example , with two opposites in the original programme that Stefan Haller summarises : ' If we take the decision in such a way , we make a huge step towards closing a giant gap in our infrastructure ' .	-4.1775

Hiking in the Hart of Stern to Star	-3.7820
In the heart the federal first " star path " is to be created .	-4.0203
This is the association of Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-2.4791
There is a planetary path in Göttingen since 2003 .	-2.4317
A " star path " comes against the need for information about many visitors ,  it  was s .	-3.9717
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.8378
The members want to set up tables along the planned route and inform you about stars and constellations .	-3.9524
At a first phase by 2018 the association plans " well-reachable installations in five to six places " in the Oberharz .	-3.6037
Inquiry would be St. Andreasberg , Braunlage , Hohegeits and Siever .	-2.5971
The information on the tables should be complemented by Internet .	-2.6897
Therefore , the selection of mobile networks plays a role in the selection .	-3.8613
Freedom of barriers is also a criterion .	-1.6547
Later the star path train should be ext t tr .	-4.9604
" On the star path , the viewers learned a lot of knowledge , for example on the physics of the individual stars , " explained the club .	-3.6742
Moreover , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star lighter more than another , even though he is much further removed   .                      	-4.5470
It also gives you the choice of a selected star and when it is best to see .	-4.1179
The association has been operating since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg the highest star waiting North Germany .	-3.5680
The location in the middle of the National Park Harz is one of the six darkest regions in Germany according to the Federal Office of Nature Protection .	-2.8741
Often there is the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with a mere eye .	-3.6159
In the United City since 2003 , there has been something similar to the planned star path initiative of the Göttingen Association Planetarium .	-4.7700
Starting before Gebhard ’ s hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the planetary path leads up to the hainberg and the star waiting - as well as an " outerranean " location in Diemarden ( municipal like ) with the planet Sedna .	-4.8478
The places with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet - are exactly displayed and standard of one to two billion .	-4.0773
The earth is shrinking to a ball of 6.5 millimetres of diameter , while the exactly 75 metres away from the sun are at any time 70 centimetres .	-4.3992
The entire distance of the planet route is four kilometres .	-3.7795
Whereas the light from sun to the pluto requires about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour until the pluto     .        I             t  . T	-4.4115

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomachenko meet for the first time , discuss a possible showdown	-1.7241
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be in a collision course to start the most exciting box fight in the near future under 147 pounds , met for the first time on Thursday .	-3.2020
They were in separate rooms in ESPN offices in Los Angeles , until Garcia , the unbeatable World Boxing Council Lightweight Champion , down the river to welcome Lomachenko , the World Boxing Organization Super-Federweight-Champion .	-5.7896
After Garcia ’ s victory through unanimous decision on the former Four Division World Championship Adrien Broner on Saturday , both fighters are members of the Top Five Pound-for Pound List .	-3.7758
Garcia stretched the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-2.3262
I wish you good luck .     '	-1.8071
Lomachenko defends its belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday evening at 19 a.m.	-2.5403
When the pair of photos posed , Lomachenko manager Egis Klimas noted that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect magnitude " .	-3.1593
" I am a former springweight " , reminded Garcia .	-2.0572
" I rise for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so great .	-2.4715
I am small for 140 .	-0.9313
I would like to come down to light weight .	-2.5812
And he must move towards lightweight weightless [ 135 pounds ] and then we struggle .	-2.7933
This is what the fans are asking for .	-2.3052
Let us give them that ' .	-1.4342
Lomachenko agreed .	-1.1729
'Boxes need this struggle ' .	-2.0013
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date next summer with Garcia ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) , which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on 23 September .	-4.1981
" This struggle could take place in the Pay-per-View mode because all fans asked him " , Garcia said and later expressed himself openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package .	-3.5284
We are the best .	-0.8560
No other names can produce this type of attention .	-2.4778
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.3457
Garcia said that he appreciated Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " , and he may participate in his Saturday fight .	-3.9330
But Lomachenko received the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinks that the triple champion from Riverside sees " very slowly , sadly Mikey ... you wanted to see the co-out " .	-4.2563
Garcia said that the focus was on showing strength , then Boxen .              	-3.1811
Both said they could feel the momentum built for their own battle .	-2.3904
" This is the fight that needs to be carried out .                	-2.6426
No other battle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-1.6392
I am more than happy to work on this , " said Garcia .                  	-2.8319

Four Injured By Ripenplatzer	-6.2471
Four people were sometimes hard to injure on Thursday afternoon in an A7 accident .	-3.1813
After the first information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost the control of his vehicle before the connection point of market wide , probably after a maturity placer .	-5.0428
The car turned to the right into the exclusion where he was overlooking and then left on the roof in the greenstrip .	-4.7427
The four occasions - two adults and two children - were partly hard to injure in the accident .	-3.0387
During the first supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was locked towards north for approximately one hour , then the traffic could be passed on the left-hand strip at the accident site .	-4.5647
Fortunas Hoffmann : " Three-chain works better " .	-1.6812
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 to seasonal appearance against Braunschweig that the optimization of defense formation brings in Aue points .	-3.7492
With the first game of season , Andre Hoffmann was satisfied , with the result , would not have been the two opposites at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-3.7008
" These were two opposites too much , and we have to be even better in Aue , " says the defender of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-3.2500
The triple chain should also be optimized in the Erzgebirge .	-3.0585
And a gate after a free limit , the fortunes don 't want to start . T               	-5.6190
" For the future , it will be the case that no more neighbouring Michael ( rensing ) will take the line . "	-3.6593
Hoffmann is convinced that his team comes better after the experience in preparation with the triple chain than with the four chain .	-3.5357
" Still I will not know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is safe to his cause , " because we have just three chains on the half-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gieselmann who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-4.6177
" The prerequisite is , but that we harmonize even better and we do not afford so many errors in construction . "	-3.8561
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-3.0716
" Whether you can speak after a decision of a failed start , do not know .	-2.6956
The performance could be okay , " Hoffmann meant .	-2.5848
" If we do not have four points on Sunday and concentrate on the pocal , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal premium . "	-4.1471
His trainer did not want to know .	-2.4468
" I judge the start into the season only after six to eight days , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to talk about an advantage about an advantage , only because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be broken earlier for a unweather .	-4.9319
" Now they can start the season with a home game " , " said Funkel and Hoffmann thinks that the Aue players might even be somewhat fresher because they would not have a serious and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorite in the bones .	-4.2634
" But they do not know so 100 percent where they are currently , " says the internal defender of the Fortuna .	-2.7474
Although guests from the Rhineland go as a light favorite on Sunday into the encounter in the finally ( almost ) made stadium of Aue .	-4.3042
" That we are forcing them just because we have the claim to come under the first six is Blodsinn , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is positive in only a defeat against aue from nine games .	-4.6192
" There is no team in the 2nd Federal League that you have to beat from the outset " explains Fortunas Chefcoach .	-3.4210
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and superior . "	-3.1595
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday .	-2.6708
New results of Swedish asylum assessment tests	-2.2021
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , who have been subject to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the tested persons are older than 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .                        	-3.9705
The Swedish Forensic Medical Authority ( Council Medical Service ) started the implementation of tests last year .	-4.4661
They should make the assessment of age more precisely during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration transfer ) has been criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees that were minor years .	-4.1690
So far , migration has sent 6.880 testing cases and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2.481 tests from the time from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-3.4226
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in addition 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency evaluated that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.1463
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.1902
The tests are only carried out in cases in which the age of the person is called into question .	-2.8872
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results over the past few months are constantly constant .	-3.9918
" We do not see a great difference in the statistics of the past months , the numbers are quite constant " , he said The Local magazine .	-3.1038
The high proportion of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.0357
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases which " proposed that the investigated person was 18 years or older " .	-2.8708
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results , it found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that it would be 18 years old this year .	-3.2918
The method of medical age assessment , in the X-ray of wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints then analyzed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas  .	-3.9830
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes the assessment of the biological maturity of people in order to see whether they went before or later than usually by       p .	-3.8833
" I had reason to think about this , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .                	-2.7927
The biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-5.4849
If we cannot say it safely , we should not do so as if we could ' , he said the newspaper metro .	-2.6725
However , Göransson defended the accuracy of tests from the Forensic Medicine Agency : " Generally , you can say that the risk of judging a child as adult is incorrect .	-4.6415
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in this case these are approximately    10  %  . ' '	-3.2078

The work on the three bridges of the national road 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg comes well .	-2.8668
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes of serious concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.9015
" We are very well at the time , it runs super " , says Reinhold Licht , construction leader in the department of roads and traffic in the Freiburg Government Bureau .	-3.7949

The first bridge coming from Schramberg leads through the Trombach .	-2.4512
It is a virgin bridge of concrete concrete with red stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-4.5716
It was built in 1900 .	-1.0800
Like the other bridges , it has now come to the years .	-2.2000
In order to ensure stability and transport security , the three constructions are now refurbished thoroughly .	-3.4084
The other bridges lead through the Lauterbach .	-2.2353
They are built from red stone stone .	-2.3970
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.1612
The bridge at the entrance of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meter wide and seven tonnes on the north side on Wednesday morning .	-3.8204
This is a peripheral fortification that is also used as an operating path .	-3.1055
The southern part of the bridge is to use a 2.20 meter bridge on Friday .	-2.9481
The pedestrian path should then be there .	-3.2903
This is particularly because they are producers , a patent of the Schramberger company Dizwo .	-3.0295
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.3651
Special feeling of fingertips has required the movement of lines by the construction in Lauterbach .	-3.7665
There is also a glass fiber cable to which many companies are connected .	-2.8513
The residents have been informed in advance of the work by handling over the project .	-3.7623
Furthermore , fish and cancer had to be fished .	-1.8610
For the bridges between the construction structure and the collection direction towards Schramberg , traffic is only regulated by a l t . T ' se i t . T ' s i a  g	-8.7448
For construction works on the bridge at the Lauterbach village entrance , the street is fully closed in the area of the bridge on the amount of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Sieven Linden " .	-4.0204
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 .	-2.2065
The country is funded .	-3.1862

How the Financial Rules of Football affect Neymar ’ s Move to Paris	-2.3230
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure of European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s world record transfer from the Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.0473
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that monitored the European game has monitored the power to ban teams of access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-3.3822
Financial fair play rules that were submitted by UEFA in 2011 means that at some point PSG must prove that the transfer of Neymar was funded without large losses .	-3.5814
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to purchase the Brazilian out of its Treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will be $ 10 million per year .	-3.2362
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France .	-2.0777
PSG can certainly make the money easier to sign Neymar and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the rich ruler family of Qatar by the energy .	-3.8141
Associations may spend much money on the purchase of players , but must counter with legitimate revenue sources that enable them to break event in their business related to football .	-4.3216
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .	-1.7653
The former French player believed that associations who had taken enormous debts in their search effectively and risked ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.9344
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentration on the debt of clubs to monitoring its losses .	-2.4208
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly in order to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harder matter .	-3.3031
During the current three-year FFP asset period , which runs by 2018 , clubs can take losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.1480
And , while Platini fallen into disgrace in 2015 by the presidency , his UEFA successor Aleksander Ceferin continues to discourage excessive expenditure .	-3.4295
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will determine the rules for the future " , said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for the UEFA for FFP , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.5704
Although the PSG has paid the buy-out clause of Neymar in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting through the duration of its contract .	-3.6582
Neymar has signed a five-year treaty , so that the amount of EUR 44.4 million can be expelled for the next five years .	-3.5308
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , has made the most severe sanctions .	-7.0279
The PSG received a fine penalty of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million later - and it was arranged that the team members remain limited to 21 players instead of normal 25 players for the Champions League of the Season 2014 / 15 .	-4.3714
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to list their financial supervision by blowing up their incomes by companies linked to the owners of a club .	-3.2406
While a catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates , UEFA would not apply this as legitimate income .	-3.6169
That is what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the sponsorship of the PSA was bloated by Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.7924
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar could come into Qatar on the payments of the World Cup 2022 Organizational Committee .	-3.4408
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar World Cup Ambassadors will become and such a manoeuvre could simply be found for the UEFA regul aut         .                             .	-5.9039
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to note any attempt to circumvent the rules                    	-3.5378
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymars Transfer , said on Thursday people familiar with the situation .	-2.6009
You spoke under the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorized to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.5155
The last published reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-2.8313
The accounts for the last fiscal year still need to be published .	-1.9111
PSG expects Neymar 's arrival to be a blessing for sponsorship deals , merchandising and tricot sales .       T ' s s a     	-4.1369
The association assumes that sales after the signature will increase by at least 30 % .	-2.6626
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players and tried to prevent Neymar ’ s way by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-2.7629
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of La League , Javier Tebas , Spanish daily newspaper AS in relation to Qatar 's ultimate ownership to PSG .	-3.7447
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is in possession of an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-3.2468

Nostalgie goes into the Niche	-1.8777
This repetition of history is at the same time nostalgic because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80 ’ s , for the 90-er-year-grunge era ( when the former David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to greater things .	-4.8120
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and an embodiment of our facebook capable era of permanent memories .	-2.7407

Way complains great gaps in the foreign register	-2.6040
'Data from citizens who should not appear ' : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-3.4443
This leads to serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-2.3699
The representative for the Federal Government ’ s refugee management , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to a media report to large gaps in the foreign central register .	-3.1810
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to serious mistakes in asylum procedures and deportations , warned in an analysis that the " Southern German Newspaper " is available .	-4.3730
According to the register , ten million people are collected with foreign nationality , including about 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.0896
The data is therefore managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.2085
Because the data has not been sufficiently maintained , the quality of data has not been good in parts so far .	-3.0509
Individual cases have been found in 1921 , " people who have long been no longer in life , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should no longer actually appear in the register ' .	-4.1060

The Bank of England will keep interest rates	-1.5063
The Bank of England will probably later announce that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and inflation have mitigated speculation over a rise .	-3.4585
The Bank of England has warned that economic growth will remain " wearing " when it retains interest rates on family income in the middle of strengthening pressure                    	-3.6236
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ’ s policymakers voted in favour of 6 to 2 in keeping interest rates to 0.25 % this month , with less members seeking an increase because weak economic growth has weakened         su                                                         i t .	-4.5524
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and for 2018 to 1.6 % , warning that pressure on budget incomes would continue , with inflation likely to rise to almost 3 % in the autumn .	-3.4275
But they signaled that in the next few years interest-rate hikes would be necessary to reduce the inflation fueled by Brexit and said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-3.8048
Members also voted in favour of withdrawing a part of the Mammut Economic Recovery Package , which was published a year ago after Brexit .	-2.8278
It will call for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from the next February , even though it has now been expected to provide 15 billion pounds more within the framework of this system - with 115 billion pounds Sterling .	-3.8947
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the central forecast of the MPC , the GDP remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on household real income continues to burden t  c  .       "  .	-4.0344
Among interest rates , it repeated that ' some streamlining of monetary policy ' to cool inflation and a ' slightly greater ' scale than markets expect .	-3.2564
Markets are currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.1950
However , the Bank emphasized that increases would be ' gradually ' and ' limited ' .	-3.0548
The Bank ’ s growth forecasts downwards for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-3.1215
She has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018  .	-3.2776
The pound fell after these news over the dollar and the euro .	-2.4135
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , and fell by 0.4 % to EUR 1.11 .	-2.1030
The decision does not change , after the recent disappointing growth figures have mitigated rising expectations for interest rates , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the previous three months to 0.3 % in the second quarter .	-4.2806
Growth is likely to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though the Bank will recover easily after the end of the year .	-2.8643
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and slight increases in salaries , since tightening will first become even worse before it will be better .	-3.9426
It added that monetary policy cannot ' prevent income over the next few years ' , but it added that the wages would be clearly recovered from the end of its three-year predictions   .	-3.9817
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , which is due to the weak pound , which will compensate some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.0690
The decision will be a year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25 % last August after the shocking EU vote that caused the decline in the pound .	-3.3461
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years until it will achieve full prices and the economy .	-2.5545
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the reputation for increased interest rates has risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers in July demanding a rise to 0.5 % .	-4.2724
Inflation declined from 2.9 % in June last month to 2.6 % , even though the Bank said this was expected and will return to it in the coming months .	-3.2746
The Bank said that the exceeding relationship with its 2 % objective is ' totally ' the weak pound .	-3.5215
Andrew Montlake , Director at Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in the swap rates , the mortgage market should become more competitive again , because lenders want to stop business and positively end the year .	-4.1149

NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylax ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now delivered by the health service over a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-4.0858

Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.1577
PrEP , when it is targeted specifically for needy and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-3.9236

The big life lives : Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned these small Earls Court apartments into a  g       home .	-4.1391
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced itself from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment in 2    y .	-2.8132
It is located on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne Terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and selled its bags .	-3.0004
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger space " , says Joanne .	-2.4470
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-1.6662
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.2836
I loved myself in them and made an offer this day ' .	-2.6721
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot has been completely outdated .	-2.5591
Originally a one-room property with a non-stored layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - Joanne Stauraum and an interim floor wanted to add the generous ceiling optimally .	-4.3940
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , a lot of light .	-1.9228
That was my requirement , " she says .	-1.7938
For this purpose she entrusted the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 foot high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for Joanne .	-3.7675
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms against each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor where you could stand .	-3.1513
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the task .	-2.4208
" The steel work is quite complicated " , he explains .	-2.1273
" We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together without having to book ourselves .	-2.8023
It was not just about building a simple platform , but to create the steel in such a way that he had the right height for the function above or below . '	-3.4859
This arrangement made it possible to place two rooms in full amount - with a lot of additional drama .	-3.4971
For the intermediate floor , a classic copper light window of Retrouvius via the glamorous living area .	-3.3232
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.1689
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .	-1.8097
At both ends , a short corridor is mirrored to leave him longer .	-2.4092
The kitchen feels like a window in another room .	-2.1816
At the entrance , mirrored units can be seated for all bridges and glasses of Joa .	-4.1401
By perceiving a glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-4.2528
Collapsible cuisine is nothing new .	-2.2875
The special offer is that this is a garage door .	-2.6730
" A little engineering art went into " , explains Erfan from the steel increased , worn MDF door .	-4.4060
" It is counterbalanced so that if you push the door it is very easy to slide .  "	-3.5252
Thanks to the clever use of space and congestion space , Joanne could win additional 16 m ² , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-2.9091
" At the end of the day you will sell the basic area - or how your property is estimated " , Erfan says .	-2.4281
" In a rudimentary form , a property broker will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the soil . "	-3.2433
Here they have managed to increase the soil area and at the same time use high-quality materials that give the space its luxurious advantage .	-3.4976
" The materials are the things you touch and therefore help create an emotional binding in a home " says Erfan .	-2.5979
" You are not loving yourself in the electrical electric doses in the walls .	-3.9080
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . "	-2.0680
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square metres of something by default into something amazing .	-3.5695
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-1.6968
Brothers struggle for a USD 500 million property empire	-2.7071
Two brethren are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute because of one of the largest property imperials in Victoria in the value of more than $ 500 million .	-3.7403
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and Developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors from his younger brother Paul , which has brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business wealth sha s . T                  	-4.4259
Paul has been intending to withdraw from family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-3.5386
Together with her mother Anna , the brethren have 38 properties in the value of more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a business in the Smith Street , Collingwood .       T            ,  t the f  19 's	-6.2826
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew up a chain of 160 retail shops .	-2.8144
It was sold for $ 85 million in 1999 .	-1.2484
This money has been invested in real estate and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the Morning City .	-3.5128
After an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul about one-third .	-3.8182
A court act states that this means that Colin has property in the value of $ 316 million and Paul in the value of $ 176 million .	-2.6626
The division of real estate and cash has proved a problem for Paul .	-2.3666
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought for the best objects " , he wrote in a first Affidavit in 2015 .	-3.1456
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.1505
The brethren now also fight for control of the existing business - which Colin , as Paul claims , has excluded it .	-3.2028
Colin argues that this is not true , but raises Paul to manage some possessions incompetently .	-2.4077
In an early Affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-2.1496
" My Italian heritage writes that the family is the most important priority " , he wrote .	-2.2022
The costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with Affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies , including deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and both sides held lawyers .	-3.6268
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicate transactions from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early seventies .	-3.4551
They used the safety to buy the Collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansladen of the family .	-3.0170
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was " in my last years of the High School , when Paul was still a little child ( approximately 10 years old ) .              	-3.3848
Anna De Lutis says that they and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property validly on their sons .	-2.3636
" Luigi often told me that he never wanted the brethren to land in court " , she wrote .	-2.4533
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million in leaving the company and Luke $ 26 million .	-3.4585
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says ' became bittered about the conditions of their financial separation ' .	-2.6460
Colin was very withdrawn , although he was a former AFL Management Board member and after a biography from Eddie McGuire , the best friend of the TV star .	-4.0235
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.8587
Only Colin answered by SMS to say " I really cannot say much " because the case is before the courts .	-2.8178
" It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts " he wrote .	-2.6231
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he tried to meet the demands of his brother .	-2.4066

Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to restrict the media abstinence of the president .	-2.3019
Others have tried and failed .	-1.2761
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so .	-1.7528
If so , he will be the first .	-1.2133
Politico reports that the new White House chief of staff plans to restrict the flow of information to President Trump - including the reports of the news media - in the hope of keeping the leader on a more evenly course .	-3.5813
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.2168
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House Chief of Staff , met with leading employees at his first working day , he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : bad information that falls into the hands of the President .	-4.1932
Kelly said to the employees that information should flow about him - whether on paper or in letters - because the president would take better decisions if he were to receive good informatio . ' ' ' .	-3.9628
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.8871
President Trump ’ s relationship with television returns decades - and now where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.7065
" When Candidate Trump was angered because of an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of bodies to be convinced , " said the former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February .	-4.7352
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keep Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption contains a continuous praise . "	-3.2848
Okay .	-0.4759
But the idea that Trump ’ s twitter habit ever was " under control " is ridiculous .	-2.2982
Perhaps these campaign officials know something that we do not know others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions .	-2.6852
We will probably never find out about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.1775
If his employees already managed to keep trouble from him , then their efforts have been worthwhile .	-3.3147
But no one has consistently avoided Trump controversy .	-2.4292
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competitive parties are always trying to promote their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views of the world .	-3.2769
Politico - very much about this history - reported in May on the preferences of consultants to hold doubtful information to the president for strategic reasons .	-3.7359
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.5135
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially with damaging leaks , and that he finds out where they are .	-3.2990
That is what happened at the end of February , when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet Provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy staff chief of Walsh to be the source behind a cluster of lecks in the White House .	-4.3575
Although Johnson was banned permanently from Twitter or that he has not offered any concrete evidence or that he expressed wrong accusations and revoked in the past .	-3.3150
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh . '	-2.3677
Goldmacher added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper cram that Trump received .	-3.7278
How did this fold ?	-1.6602
Kelly tries to do the same three months later .	-1.5730
Perhaps he will demonstrate himself as a priebus more effective manager , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his consultants strive for influence .	-3.0414
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.9899

Travellers negotiate about a division and return to the ' millionaire series '       .	-2.9690
Some of the wealthiest house owners of the West Midlands are again negotiated with some determined travellers on war foot that have negotiated a digged to call for a field before their manor houses  .	-4.7735
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , called the " millionaire series " .	-2.9672
They have brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were cast out only in May , but without being discouraged by the Council to prevent their incidents .	-3.8229
The tactful group found a gap in defense facilities and pressed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-2.8600
Angry residents urged the Solihull Council , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-2.9212
An anonymous inhabitant said : " You are drawn there on Monday night after they were sent from Bentley Heath where they thrown stones on the passers .	-3.7383
The Council must be forced to implement through shame , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.2732
Travellers were there in May , have been moved and are now back .	-2.6610
More came to yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.3624
It added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by keeping long submissions to protect their parks .	-2.8538
I live on the Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my community tax if the Council cannot even stop that . '	-2.6520
A people who did not want to be mentioned said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travellers only to be plundered by another round .	-3.3577
The figures have increased this time and one has even seen a horse in the parking area . "	-2.8290
A spokesman from the Solihull Council said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond the Streetsbrook Road and work with the police of Solihull , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to ensure that they continue as quickly as possible .	-4.1530
To support our evidence collection , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti-social or criminal behavior at the police by calling 101 .	-3.2029
This contributes to creating an image from the situation in which the court has to examine when we are presenting our case . '	-3.3004
From Birkenhof , Waldhotel Luise	-1.2961
From the former Hotel Birkenhof , the Waldhotel Luise becomes the f .	-3.0744
The house is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-2.9724
These are good news for the city .	-1.1485
Because with the closing of the Hotel Birkenhof through the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH at 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 nights were lost a year and also revenues by the curtax .	-4.8351
In the autumn of 2014 , in the face of dramatically increasing numbers of refugees that came into the district , the hotel building offered the office as collection accommodation , which provided controversial discussions .	-4.3708
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers from setting up a construction plan to ensure the area as a hotel site .	-3.7860
The decision was not disputed at that time in the Council of Communities .	-2.6416
But , above all , Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel site and spoke of serious interested in the house at that time .	-4.3634
He should be right .	-1.3733
The Luisenhotels Group with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , with headquarters in Bad Bergzabern , has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-4.0187
The group has four houses with the Freudenstädter object .	-2.1609
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.5082
Hotel Luise , Luise , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-2.3374
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and if you enter the house , it is clear that extensive renovation work is made .	-4.3921
The floors have been exhausted , ceilings have been partly dismantled , old bathrooms from the rooms .	-3.9503
The entire hotel building is a single building site .	-1.7505
There is still much to be done by         March .              	-2.1739
" It is a nice hotel " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.4452
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest Style .	-1.9975
The rooms are equipped with large common showers , the entrance area is transformed , new windows are built .	-3.2589
Everything should be ' beautiful citizenship ' as Thomas Scherer expresses .	-2.5991
" We want to make a jewelry out of it . "	-2.3068
Swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities .	-3.6417
There was no position at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad , but already emphasized at a high c city level , Scherer .	-4.2598
The Waldhotel Luise , with its about 60 rooms , wants to be broad , explains Scherer .	-3.5085
Both individual holidays , groups or businessmen should feel at home in t hotel .	-3.3197
Talks with OB Julian Osswald and Tourism Director Michael Krause he has already conducted , said Scherer .	-3.1580
The ideas of the city are similar to those of the Hotel Group .	-2.7096
" We are on the same line . "	-1.2529
After the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to set carefully .	-2.7844
Just below a million euros , it expects i      .	-2.9502
The outside facilities are also brought on front , and that is already clearly visible .	-3.4309
A large terrace will be accessible by the restaurant which is public .	-2.9665
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Joy city is a good market " .	-2.1474
Russia ’ s Affair : US Special Defender sets Grand Jury	-2.5393
In the Russian affair of US President Donald Trump , special investigators Robert Mueller should have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.0133
In recent weeks , the body has included the work , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " under appeal on the matter .	-4.2606
The newspaper was the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations .	-2.7988
The CNN transmitter reported that there are already first charges of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russi l         . Th             	-4.0594
US intelligence services have been accusing the Kremlin for longer to have interfered specifically in the 2016 presidential election campaign .          T     ' 	-4.0541
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.2492
In the focus of the investigations , several men who acted as advisers of the Republican election campaign .	-3.1538
According to reports , Mueller also took more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment under the lupe .	-2.5139
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that special investigator Trump personally returned to the centre and examined the accusation of whether the President may have handed in the course of the affair .	-4.4431
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in possible crime cases and to decide whether charges should be made .	-3.2458
Grand Jurys are therefore also called chambers of  ch .                     	-5.4250
Mostly they are turned on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-2.7957
The procedure is always behind closed doors .	-1.7184
The board can also be enabled by the Public Prosecutor to download persons for belonging to oath .	-4.6342
According to the CNN station , there have already been templates that revolve around the encounter between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.3291
People who have been involved in the meeting were asked to say that it was in the report .	-3.1136
They should also provide documents .	-1.4332
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s consultants and silencer son Jared Kushner , and his then election campaign Paul Manafort , were also discussed .	-5.8443
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the establishment showed that Mueller cannot be intimidated in his work , and that if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .	-3.8961
But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned in the end to decide the collection of an indictment .	-3.2764
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the start of a new stage in the investigations and a new reason for concern for President Trump .	-3.0866
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday night to present the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.9453
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.7414
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to ' feel well because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-2.7939
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion , he did not know about the use of a Grand Jury .	-3.3176
But they also usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-2.9418
The White House supports any measures that speeded up the work of the special investor in ' fair ' ways .	-2.8493
The former FBI chief James Comey said three times that the president would not be identified .	-2.4520
There is no reason to assume that this has changed , in the declaration .	-3.4690
But Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired .	-1.9828
Accusations against Trump have become loud because of this drop , he wanted to hinder the judiciary .	-3.4539
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to set out the investigations against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.3820
The President is under great pressure for the investigation .	-2.3395
After presenting US media , the White House collected material against the special investor and its employees .	-2.8343
The speculation solved whether Trump Mueller wanted to release .	-3.0054
Unlike an independent Congress special investor , such as the Watergate affair , President Richard Nixon resigned later , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired from the Ministry of Justice t t urg the  president .	-4.4280
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step .	-1.9245
Two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft legislation on Thursday , after which the special investor could no longer be released so easily .	-4.1913
Antarctic : Gigantic Iceberg Drives	-3.5502
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has resolved from the scarcely seventies size of Berlin from the Schelfeis .	-3.8367
This shared the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Sea Research on Wednesday .	-2.1222
The more than a trillion tonnes heavy and 5800 square kilometres now drive to the north and will probably need two three years until it was melted .	-4.4153
He is one of the biggest ice giants who have registered researchers over the past three decades with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-3.2816
There is no risk for people .	-2.6479
To what extent climate change has played a role in the dismantling of the iceberg , it is unclear according to resea           	-3.4785
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice-cream in the region for around 30 years , writing the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a fact background .	-3.8502
Many researchers believe that this can be related to global war .	-2.1825
The now broken coloss has been part of the Larsen-C-Schelfeis .	-3.7369
Swimming on the sea and is fitted by large glaciers .	-2.6303
It is therefore always growing into the sea and breaks regularly .	-3.2861
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula                 	-2.9178
The north of this schellfish was the balance of growth and cancellation a few years ago .	-3.5003
A complete schelfeis is falling there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-2.5523
There is something that the Larsen-C-Schelfeis is in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is currently .	-3.5664
In addition , the ice cream is under tension and can fall if a key place cancels a piece .	-4.2805
The melting of Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase the sea level because they are swimming on the water and ice drinks as much water as they are after melting their own .	-4.7577
However , the loss of the Schelfeise leads to the glaciers to the sea and flow much faster than before .	-3.5079
This might possibly increase the sea level , but the British research project writes to monitor the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-3.3586
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest schelfish of the Antarctic according to AWI details with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-3.4562
The transition from the mainland is up to 700 meters thick , on the free edge to the free ocean around 200 meters .	-3.2145
There it regularly discards .	-3.3160
" Although it is a natural event and it is not a direct connection to climate change , the ice shield now comes into a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary from the British Swansea University .	-3.5295
" This is the broadest withdrawal since the beginning of the records , " he also confirmed .	-2.5264
Among scientists were controversial whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis would grow again or in the long term , and possibly coincide together , his colleague Adrian Luckman said : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-4.0244
But this development will take decades .	-1.3438
Even though these researchers do not resort to the dismantling of this gigantic iceberg to climate change , there have been a large number of ice-creams of the Antarctic Peninsula in recent decades .	-4.6645
This long summit of the Antarctic is South America .	-2.7394
According to the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-2.6455
The temperature rise has contributed to the decline .	-1.9774
The Antarctic Peninsula have warmed about three degrees over the past 50 years , including the areas where the temperature is rising fastest .	-3.6622
CDU Wants Hou Fare at Staff	-9.2121
Because it is becoming more and more difficult to occupy free , the CDU calls for employers ' association to become more attractive .	-3.1703
Just before the summer break , the Kreistag has winnered 41 new positions in the administration .	-3.1481
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circle management in Mettmann .	-1.9249
Now , once again , 17 trainees have their first work day behind thems .	-2.7817
The training points are obviously very much honoured .	-4.0721
Around 620 applications have been recorded for this year 's places .	-2.7823
Nevertheless , the circle is lacking staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks .	-3.3473
There are still 50 non-occupied places at the Mettmann circle .	-2.8378
Doctors and engineers and forces of general administration are sought .	-2.8086
The CDU would now like to take the initiative with the FDP and the UWG in the Kreistag and counter the shortage of professionals in the administration .	-4.2197
The administration should prepare a concept for personnel extension and personnel development after the wish of the parties ' .	-3.9204
The aim is to cover not only short-term needs of professionals but to counter the applicant shortages instead of counteract .	-3.8593
The overall concept should internally and externally orientate , show concrete measures for trainees and include a training offensive , call on CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.4565
This is a good approach .	-2.2802
Because the circle has to do with staff problems that were not known earlier .	-3.2011
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.1528
The speech is about a regulated ' competition from public employers ' .	-2.8122
There is also a high number of employees who depart from the service of disease or age .	-3.7506
Therefore , the highest time to act so that there is no longer any more jobs that are undeployed .	-4.7182
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples , Head of Group of the CDU , goes beyond the joint request with his party .	-2.5865
He recently provided a faust-dick surprise in the Kreistag when he publicly challenged staff costs and amused the other parties .	-4.3150
Peoples would like to review all the possibilities that enable leaving from the local employers ' association .	-3.6453
" If we do not come to a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the circle management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the circular cities - should strive for a house fare " , peoples .	-4.6057
The CDU is trying to pay better attention to employees and officials than providing for the public service tariff requi .     T .                     	-5.3130
The salaries are currently exactly required , increases or more money only exists if they are changed into a higher level oriented to work years .	-5.9174
But the tasks of the circle have grown more and more in recent years .	-2.0878
Only a few weeks ago we had to establish new spaces where employees work on the provisions of the new prostitute protection law .	-3.6002
Last but not least through the rising number of asylum seekers , Thomas Hendele and Kreisdirector Martin Richter have a problem : they have too little staff .	-3.1830
Italy Worsens the Tone on NGO Migrant Bailouts	-2.7992
Italy has warned NGOs , which use bailouts for migrants in the Mediterranean , that they must not continue this if they do not comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.4186
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue " , said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-3.0609
Minniti ’ s warning came one day after the Italian authorities had confiscated a boat from the German aid organization , because their team had worked effectively with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-3.5073
The aid organization , which has only been operating for one year , rejected the comment on detailed accusations of the Italian Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.6480
" For us , and remains the rescue of human life our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate in the search and rescue area at the moment , " said the organisation in an opinion on the social media .	-4.0228
" We can judge all the accusations that are currently being made after we have collected all the information and judge the situation " .	-3.2780
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Rescue ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-1.9844
It is suggested that his crew takes hose boat migrants directly delivered by human traffickers , and that the smugglers can drive so that ships can be reused again .	-4.3757
At least such a meeting took place only 1.3 miles before the Libyan coast , according to the act of the Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.3350
The occupation is suspected of overcoming the authority of Italian coastguard , monitoring rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motive .	-4.6983
Under the code of conduct , boats like Iuventa must have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-2.8253
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far explained to keep themselves on the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.3779
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not bring with it any ' essential changes or disabilities ' of their rescue actio   .                   .	-3.6756
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Laureate Organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.3458
Minniti now said that the number of migrants arriving following the Italian rescue measures has declined severely in recent weeks , which suggests that the efforts to strengthen Libyan coastguard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.2352
" In recent days we have started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.8576
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month about economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of Europe .	-3.4477

But is this a right sport ?                  	-3.1997
For many , the idea of safe accustomed is needed .	-3.0482
Ingo Froböse has also discussed the question for a long time .	-2.6959
For the professor at the German Sports University in Cologne , e-sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-4.0187
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and a rapid response capability .	-2.6821
Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their bodies and respect food .	-2.8141
" The fitte player is a good player . "	-1.2974
But it also sees problems : " Doping is getting more and more a    i            	-4.5746
Controls are hard to implement online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classic sport .                  	-3.8287
The scientist highlights the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-2.3671
The players are on the road , that is like a large global family , and there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.3060
A study of corporate consulting Deloitte and the Federal Association Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts e-sport rapid growth .	-2.8372
In 2016 , this has implemented EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly over advertising , sponsorship and great tournaments .	-2.8596
In three years , turnover should be 130 million .	-2.0623
That is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the Federal Federal League .	-3.1209
However , e-sport " is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " write the Deloitte advisors .	-4.3315
Internationally , many countries are already more .	-3.1085
Large markets are Asia and the US , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O`Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.7936
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport betting provider Unikrn .	-1.9443
Something is doing in Europe too .	-2.2032
In a Norwegian school , e-sport has been introduced as a teaching technique , says Froböse .	-3.2530
In the Netherlands and France , the Football First-Liga Associations , according to Dutt , are now obliged to create an e-sport department .	-3.3473
" In the European comparison , Germany lags behind " , VfB Board explains Röttgermann .	-2.6083
Declining only in Nostalgia and explaining the old times is no longer enough today .	-3.1780
It is a question of preserving the tradition of the association , but also targeting the company in the modern market .	-3.1177
" We live in a digitalized world " , says Dutt .	-2.6465

Toxic Eggs ade - Eggs to Cook and Bake	-6.1310
The scandal for toxic eggs is now affected by almost all the states o the G .	-3.5234

Condemned Michelle Carter for the Texts that Conrad Roy urge to suicide ,	-6.7175
A woman from massachusetts was condemned to two and a half years because she has encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .	-2.6195
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of their condemnation behind grids , and five years were exposed to proven .	-7.2248
Carter was condemned in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took the life on 13 July 2014 .    I    hav a     s  o ma .	-5.0274
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is undesirable .	-2.8041
My son was my best friend . '	-1.2493
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .	-3.8170
She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy were suffering from a mental disease .	-3.3984
In red hoses and a cream-coloured blouse , Carter stood with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and down eyes when she was condemned .                             	-5.3031
" Your actions have brought Conrad Roy " , said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.6681
" She ended his life to make their own better .	-1.7462
She has not assumed responsibility , she said .	-2.1473
" She did not show any repentance " .	-3.9200
But Carter ’ s lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance that she completely regrets ' .	-2.8874
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find out that their " age or maturity " or even their mindset have a significant influence on their actions " .	-4.0659
A prosecutor rather than a declaration by Roy ’ s mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is no day when I do not entrust the loss of my loved son .	-3.8622
I would like him to be proud of me and how I are dealing with everything , despite all my pain that we will bear for eternity , it means that it is .	-5.2276
Roy ’ s sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or would be a tant for his children .	-2.9933
" No longer have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will keep for the rest of my life with me " she said .	-3.3559
The case seems to be a legal precedent because there is no law in massachusetts that makes there a crime to call on another to commit suicide .	-2.9823
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead by a carbon monoxide poison in a vehicle in 2014 .	-2.2367
The case moved national attention to itself after Carter ’ s text communications revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-3.0721
" Depend on yourself , jumping on a building , I do not know there are many ways " , she said in several messages she sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was in his family on holiday .	-4.0747
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : " You have to do it , Conrad " and " Everything you have to do is to turn the generator and you will be free and happy " .	-3.3649
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and arranged to benefit from the case through any press .	-2.7754
The case has shared the legal opinion .	-1.5672
Amanda Knox , who was condemned by murderer in Italy in 2007 , was one of the few who defended Carter , belonged to Italy before she was released two years ago .	-3.9687
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves sympathy and help , not prison ' .	-2.5120
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the FC Bavaria	-1.6867
There is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was able to run as a captain at the Audi Cup .	-3.1021
The FC Bayern has a large season to the Confed Cup winner - extra motivation does not hurt there .	-3.7220
Something was different from his place in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even if the additional clothing piece was very small .	-3.1619
But there was no Philipp Lahm on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , and not a manuel new , he made himself the binds allocated to the arm .	-4.4994
" The trainer did not announce it " told the Confed Cup winner , after his first use as Bavarian captain .	-3.1249
Well , the beginning could have been better than in 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.3097
But the sign of the coach could also indicate Kimmich .	-4.3157
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal was selected as a game leader in the professionals coming from youth players , debutants and precisely from the holidays .	-4.0511
Sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep up with laundry .	-4.0360
So who was exchanged to enter the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well .	-3.3947
Kimmich confirmed : " That is what one wants to take responsibility as a player .	-4.9346
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flied as a mini-lahm over the field .	-2.7457
To the right , this is his position , the white binds of the poor did their own .	-3.1842
And at all , Kimmich worked in this start formation like those who can best take the rower into hand .	-4.0539
He gave instructions to try to direct the uninterplayed troops   .	-2.8574
He had a glance , while many others were concerned with himself .	-3.0463
Vidal with overplaying his lack of fitness ( hardly scarcely ) ; Renato Sanches with the devil coming out of the services of Asia trips ( clapped even ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle with not negative in their first performance in the Bavarian trikot .	-5.6782
That , after all , was very good .	-3.6624
In addition to Kimmich , Rudy came up before the defense , both operated sovereig .	-5.8201
The renowned Napoli storm often did difficult , and soul also tried to succeed in playing .	-4.1042
Although his colleague Mr Rudy admitted that the outcome ' was not as we hoped ' .	-2.8842
But he also showed a proper performance in the debut .	-2.2851
Relocation , tempo change : " For this style I was also holded " .	-4.2268
As unusual , this Bavarian world is still for new accesses , you saw the party following .	-3.2980
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two , but determine six or seven interviews .	-2.5224
Kimmich adopted a few critical statements in the back of his new players .	-3.1226
There he heard an interesting sentence from soul : " What is going on here I have already noticed .	-3.2474
In Bavaria you have to win every game " .	-2.3464
After all , it must no longer bring the new one to th t .	-3.4590

Companies satisfied with Rhineland-Pfelzic Minister : Economy praises Wissings Tempo	-3.2838
It has often become intransigent , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still an economic minister of Rheinland-Pf .	-3.3913
This shows more than a year in which the new Economic Minister for People Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-2.7157
Chambers and businesses from the region are talking about TV request from change in economic policy - and at the same time the old minister i t   .	-3.9600
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier United Units ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing addresses the economy 's wishes , which Lemke has all blocked " .	-4.0196
The biggest turn of natus sees nature in infrastructure policy : the loophole of motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities .	-3.7122
This year the Ministry of Department will hope for a planning procedure by 2021 will be the right to construct .	-4.1921
A role in the country ’ s plans also plays Trier ’ s western approach , which is the primary need for the Federal Transport Plan .	-3.7210
The aim is to operate the route in December 2020 , says Ministry Speaker Cornelia Holtmann .	-2.5601
Natus sees a way to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-2.5986
The Industrial and Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier seeks to increase the sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports for ten years .	-3.5795
In addition , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to found a company praises the IHK .	-2.8433
The Trier Chamber sees an additional incentive for young trainees in the new Master Bonus , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-2.7763
A premium of EUR 1 000 is planned for the existing championship and EUR 2500 when graduates make themselves independent within ten years after master training .	-4.4026
The homework list for the country remains long .	-2.0745
In the planned road manufacturing , the country misses the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , the main manager of the IHK Trier .	-4.3036
Of 56 new engineers who want to set up Wissing in the country ’ s operation mobility , there are only 29 posts .	-4.9922
The IHK calls for more orders to be awarded to external offices .	-2.0577
CDU Group vice Christian Baldauf refers to the Court of Auditors ' calculations , investing the country in 2017 and 2018 more than EUR 20 million less than proposed .	-3.0434
Frank Natus is also expecting a concept of the country which wants to fix the shortage of professionals in the region .	-3.2891
It is also disturbing that broadband expansion in the country .	-3.0336

Audi should change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash response	-2.7631
One day before Audi announcement said BMW that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.2898
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is resident - to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-3.6360
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it will modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.4362
None of the companies described companies as a recall .	-2.1035
European car manufacturers have strongly promoted the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.6403
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered as carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-6.0635
The cost of automotive manufacturers to install equipment for the neutralization of the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases what it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-3.5757
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of ignoring the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .     T              	-3.8310
The companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called shift equipment , the emissions to comply with the rules when a car has been tested but returned to normal driving conditions .	-4.1414
Several employees were charged by Volkswagen in the United States , others are examined on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.7145
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in Audi 's engine development in Germany .	-2.3986
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition , and could be judged in the United States .	-2.7522
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations in Volkswagen after the authorities Audi accused of having installed a system to avoid emissions rules in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was expanded .	-3.7041
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could hardly burden Volkswagen : the luxury manufacturer contributes to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.3496

Once again , when it draws to Isar on Saturday , there will be a great flow between the army and the rich bridge .	-4.6079
That is not a common flow , with Isar tourists .	-2.7712

On the river you see a big information transparent .	-2.9454
It shows a mountain mountain .	-1.8505
The presence of a public campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-2.4896
With the motto " True love is ... " , the understanding of Isar is to sharpen as a protective wild flow .	-3.1055

Murderless Knollenases and Laughter against Suffering	-2.3700
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published Cartoon drawers , the collection nases of his figures are his trademark .	-2.9945
Also with 85 , the Argentine still draws and works on a f         .	-3.3128
His message : Laughing , " because there is too much suffering in the world " .	-2.2211
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as a son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.9614
In the first years as artists , he among other things became a signatory for congratulations cards - which frustrated him .	-3.8694
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when in my job , " he once said .	-2.4205
According to stations in Lima , New York and Paris , his breakthrough ended the 1960s : with the release of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in the " star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-3.9903
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.3806
The artist could always be inspired by cities .	-2.7252
Large , roundly Mordillo figures are surrounded by drawings with the tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.1229
According to the early morning he sits his own information today , almost ten hours work daily .	-3.8965
Calendars , puzzles , books for big and small , T-shirts , plush animals and watches continue to find his three figures worldwide .	-3.7790
For six years he has also worked on a character film and a TV series with his figures .	-2.5302
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand feet as an opponent .	-4.4443
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which will come to the cinema in 2019 .	-3.9364
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me " , says Mordillo .	-2.0645
The script is not written by him .	-2.0920
He therefore rather puts it on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced wordlessly .	-4.5789
Threatened lavender from the Provence	-2.1281
It has become a symbol of provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.2261
The lavender is declining because of the insects transmitted to droughts and because of the diseases , which prepares scientists and farmers who try to find solutions .	-4.5783
Eric Chaisse , expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively under threat because the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which has brought much less rain in the spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.3285
This has an impact on the life of Lavendel .	-1.8090
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicades , and at very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.3266
And there is much at stake .	-2.0772
Lavendel oil is not only attractive for holidays , but also for perfumes and cosmetics .	-3.8749
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant waters with a large number of flowers , we have weakened smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-3.0993
So we have less parts of ethereal oil . '	-2.0447
The solutions that are considered are better distribution of water and slowdown from the ground , but also the spraying of plants with a protective mixture of tone and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry nature .	-4.0230

Murdering a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-1.9774
The staff of the weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meet Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the Sinaloa State by organised crime , corrupt officials , and unstoppable drug wars .	-3.9658
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety  .                	-2.8964
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.8370
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels more safer : they should take their children with the office that were the objective of an attack with granates in 2009 or let them home .	-3.6856
Security experts have written three words to a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.6234
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and construction senses are     e .	-3.5290
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen , journalists who are suspected of standing on the government ’ s salary list or cartel , a catalogue of criminals that make Mexico ’ s chaos dangerous .	-3.7233
There is no rest pause from violence , and throughout the country , more and more journalists have taken place : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto in December 2012 , 589 stand after attacks and threats under federal protection and up to now there were at least seven deaths in seven countries .	-4.6480
Among the latter is their publisher and their inspirator of Riodoce , the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.0009
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist " , Valdez wrote in one of his many books about violence in connection with drugs .	-2.4757
His absence is deeply found , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez which shows his middle finger with the word " Justice " depends on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-6.1063
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-2.4839
Although a Special Prosecutor was built in 2010 to edit the cases of journalists , according to the committee to protect journalists , only two criminal proceedings were built .	-3.2502
As in most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , the murderers of journalists are rarely being put to justice .	-3.1583
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are undestructible and although the terrain is now more treasurable .	-3.6493
Without information about the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little use , Ibarra says .	-2.5366
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop " he says .	-1.7650
" As long as we do not know why , we all distrust . "	-2.7669
On the morning of 15 May Valdez left the office of the Riodoce newspaper in the capital of Culiacan .	-2.5786
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was continued by two men .	-4.3004
The protection took away in his car and damaged it near .	-3.9667
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8917
He left behind a woman and two adult children .	-1.3871
Rumours tend to fly around in Culiacan .	-1.8439
But there is virtually nothing as silence on Valdez .	-2.5261
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition in the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s most bloodiest battlefields , as rivalry groups fight here to fill the vacuum .	-3.2251
It is not acceptable that someone or several people are shot on the streets in Sinaloa every day or that the graveyard is fully decorated by two-story mousols for drug kings who are larger than many houses for livers .	-4.5720
Forget for one minute that there is a state of " rest " if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .	-3.2271
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a founder and director of Riodoce , blamed for not protecting his friend .	-2.9659
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.6081
First , in February there was the release of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel fractions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.4100
This release may have angry the sons , suspected Gang members bought each copy of the output as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks  . T                   	-4.5090
The second mistake was to force Valdez to leave the country to its own security after the confiscation of another newspaper , which had published the same history .	-3.0231
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is considered a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.1909
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be here .	-2.1450
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he sold USD 50 involvements with five colleagues to establish Riodoce .	-3.7096
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without encountering the noise problem " , said Bojorquez .                 	-3.5078
With the time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and the turnover and advertising took place .	-3.4152
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard studies without fear of censorship , and the readers were fascinated by a publication in which they were able to read stories that no one else dared to treat .	-4.0060
Eight years after the foundation of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria Moors Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-2.6571
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee to protect journalists for his courage in persecuting Mexican drug history , wherever she led .  T ' s a s f . ' I ' , ' T 'Po '  , ' ' T	-7.6293
He voluntarily agreed that he was afraid .	-1.7879
" I would like to live on " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.9134
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life " , said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.2774
" You need to take the task that cancels you as a journalist - either that or you play the stumbles .	-3.1477
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what went before ? '	-3.2911
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird that could flee like a port worker , the friend who was generously with marmings and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.4971
They familiar with his routine .	-1.9444
He would always bear his hat .	-1.9666
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar from the office , go and always sit on the same table there .	-3.1497
Now they ask : Was his love to routine his ferbians ?	-3.1473
His death has also forced them to call into question their own assumptions about how they can do their work best and stay in life .	-3.5074
" You do not like it if you are concerned with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret starting and landing runs " to move drugs .	-3.9210
" These things were not allowed " , said Bojorquez .	-1.4635
The result is , even in the best times , a high level of self-censorship and self-enforcement .	-2.4676
His own instincts trust .	-1.5376
If it is wrong , then there is away from it .	-3.3211
The trouble is , said the publisher of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the matter has happened to Javier " .	-3.2046
The old rules , as he and others say , are no longer valid in Sinaloa - just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials at home .	-3.5566
The landscape is changing constantly .               	-2.5429

Outside there were two police protections from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 ° C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.5741
They were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle class area of Culiacan .	-2.7243
Half in joke , some of the reporters asked whether these officers belong to the 50 % of the policemen that the governor himself called not trustworthy .	-3.3498
It has been months since the reporters have gone to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.1317
For this week 's issue , Riodoce has looked at three main stories .	-2.7357
There was the assassination of the brother of the former known Boxers Julio Cesar Chavez in Sin             	-2.8705
They also had an exposé to the state spending that focused on the home city of the governor .	-2.9803
And there was a group that removed a distance in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the Prosecutor 's Office .	-3.3935
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or as it happened , so was cautious when it was time to write what everyone knows in the city : that the restaurant is a favourite country of drug traffickers and authorities .	-3.6723
A reporter recorded from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated all the political levels almost the whole century .	-3.9091
Several PRI governors were recently accused of high-quality cases of corruption .	-2.1130
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman declined a military accident .	-3.0652
Only a few months before , the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source about the kidnapping   .     I w s t b . Th s i w w	-6.9007
" Earlier we had known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the top name " El Flaco " because of its slender body stature .	-3.5286
" Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . "	-1.7873
The Valdez office was dedicated to the storage area for characters and stickers who protest against the murders of journalists because the employees have become something they never expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-3.6138
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-3.1370
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.9816
A burned body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests , that it is .	-3.2152
Journalists have become louder in the whole country by writing to walks and buildings in organised protests " SOS Press " .	-3.3216
On this day , the Bojorquez director is away from Washington and tries to gather international support for justice in the case of Valdez .	-2.9620
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying out journalists and bringing them out because they have said the truth .	-4.0701
Since then , it has been asking that it is redivided by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-3.0526
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are surrounded by organised crime , involved government officials and an indifferent society .                       	-3.3391
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on commands of politicians and security forces that have been under organised crime .	-3.9210
The Articulo 19 media guardian group assigned more than half of the attacks on police and officials last year .	-2.7983
" In Mexico , you died because they want you to keep the mouth " , said Ramirez .	-2.0775
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-1.6567
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-3.5292

Some journalists have fled from their home countries or even from the country .	-1.8294
It is a painful decision .	-0.9810
It is difficult to find work in exile and they still observe the streets and seek dangers .	-2.6217
And sometimes they are driven , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico city in 2015 .	-4.1729

At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already ended , the editors of Riodoce were on the citizens ' style before the office and drank beer , when all their phones began to sum up .	-4.5129
A number of shooters with band rivals and security forces near Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-3.0544
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-2.2654
From the board stone edge they have released the news on the Riodoce website on mobile phones .	-3.2011
The front page had to be changed on the next day .	-2.1804

Now researchers have found that the first knowledge of the incredible nashorn of a Canadian miner was received so well that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-3.4735
It was so good that they could even see his scary skin of red brown - and she said she had had something of a " unconcerted past " .	-4.0842
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " referred to him as " the best tanked dinosaur ever found , and one of the best dinosaur copies in the world " .	-3.6761
The fossil is a newly discovered kind of Nodosaurians who lived in the middle of crowding time between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-2.8899
His incredibly well-kept condition has amazed researchers that d   ' r r '            .	-11.9419
According to reports in National Geographic , the tanked plant fresher is the best preserved fossil of his kind .	-3.1540
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.6006
He met something that seemed lacking from the surrounding rock , and decided to see more precisely .	-3.2632
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-2.1208
They spent the next six years on discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) of serious earth clumps .	-3.0527
After all this hard work , the finished result is now prepared to be rev     .	-2.3325
" If you just blinz a little with the eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept " , the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to see .	-3.6625
" It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and best received dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs . "	-3.2226
Researchers have found that this plant fresher , even though it is covered with an armament and similar to a changing tank , has probably been threatened by meat extracting dinosaurs .	-6.7769
The highly tanked dinosaur used a red and white discovery to hide before predators , and used a shielding technology known as counter-shading , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.2685
This would have allowed it to mix itself better into its environment and to overcome its enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by greater dinosaurs .	-3.8516
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurian family has made headlines for the first time in May and is now to see in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.1504
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and it called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum Engineer Mark Mitchell , one of a team that spent more than 7,000 hours of discovering it carefully .	-3.5115
The amazing conservation of the copy enabled Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of schools and armor over his body .	-3.0686
They discovered the contershade , a widespread defense method in the animal wealth , meaning that the top of creature was darker than their bottom .	-3.3266
Although the contershade is usual , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals that live today .	-4.3090
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted from sufficient pressure by meat extensive dinosaurs that the evolution favored the confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.0764
But most contemporary animals using contemporary shattering - think of rehears , cebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than points , signaling that this nodosaurian was a real fight for survival .	-4.4600
" Strong predatory behaviour on a massive , strongly tanked dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of crown have been " , said Brown .	-4.2466
The chemical analysis of organic connections in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.2094
Scientists continue to investigate the animal to references to his life , including his conserved content to find out what has eaten as his last meal .	-3.4340
They believe that the dinosaur , when he died , was driven into a river and driven to the sea where he declined on the back to the sea .	-3.1742
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further landingway than they are today .	-3.1250
" This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is covered with completely conserved skin , but also retained in three dimensions and maintains the original form of animal " , said Brown .	-3.8793
" The result is that the animal looks almost just as in the early crowd time .	-2.3865
You don 't need to use a lot of imagination to reconstruct it . If  you jus pla a little eye , you could a l th b b    t believe th s                       	-4.8074
The crowd time was a time when huge theropods , meat-reading dinosaurs , which were on two legs , were through the earth .	-5.0674
Although the king lived from them , the Tyrannosaurus Rex , millions of years living in Borealopelta , the tanked dinosaur was hunted by some of his fearful ancestors .	-3.4952
These include the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of severe monsters .          t        . The  a 	-5.4382
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal , believe that Borealopelta was sanctioned after death in the sea and mumified in the sludge .	-3.4220
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.5347
According to the museum , it is the world ’ s best tanked dinosaur , including skin and armor , and is completely from the schnauze to the hip .	-3.7849
The creatures were long at an average of about 18 foot ( 5 meters ) and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.2372
It contained two 20-customs leaders that raised by his shoulders .	-3.3439
The researchers believe that the tanked vegetable freezer was flooded by the Western Canada until an overflooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.6197
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserved his armor in exquisite detail .	-3.6116
The stoned remains of this particular copy are so well received that the skin remains still cover skin plates along the dinosaur .	-6.3495
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is rare as a profit in the lotto .	-2.3344
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.8106
Stoned remains of the skin are still covering the peak tank plates that wear the skin of the animal .	-4.6025
His right feet lies on his side , his five fingers are spread upward .	-3.0615
I can count the scoups on his sole ' .	-1.6267
In the Gewitter : Mass carambolage on A8 : Many injured i	-4.3975
Heated accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Knarp 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.7430
There are many injured , kilometer-long congestion - and gaffer .	-2.4371
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured at a mass carambolage late Thursday afternoon .	-3.0158
After the first indications of the police , at 5 p.m. between the connectors Aedelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Landkreis Aichach-Friedberg ) during a width , nearly 30 vehicles , including lorries , were probably also lorries .	-5.3058
There were no information about the exact number of injured people .	-2.5212
It is easy to medium-sized injuries , said a police speaker .	-2.4772
A great offer of rescue vehicles was at the accident p .	-3.0416
The A8 was fully closed direction to Munich .	-2.1111
In the direction of Munich , a roughly ten kilometres of long retreat .	-3.5046
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive disabilities on the counter-train - through numerous gaffers .	-3.7936
The fire was noted by the labels of the vehicle linkers who now have sensitive penalties to expect .	-3.9459
Shortly after 18 : 45 there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.7075
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-2.2245
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .	-3.8368
German train : Group tests " Comfort Check-in " .	-1.7956
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing is sitting in the train and sleeping .	-3.2710
Or one is deepened in his work and has a genius thought .	-3.8075
And then : cuff .	-1.5230
If the creator comes and raises an unsoft or travels the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-3.7972
Ticket control .	-1.5043
But the times of interruptions are over soon .	-2.1704
Deutsche Bahn tests currently the creative ticket control .	-2.1839
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your place and devalue the ticket .	-3.2525
A test operation is currently under two routes .	-3.5908
" Comes the offer , we wide it .	-4.0028
It will then likely be available on many other routes in Germany at the beginning of next year , " said a train speaker                          	-4.0333
" Comfort check-in " calls the ticket devaluation without creator .	-2.7116
However , to be able to use these conditions , you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-3.2832
And you have to book an online ticket - which already does most passengers .	-2.8724
It is also necessary to book the App of the Railway DB Navigator , which is the most comfortable type of ticket booking .	-3.8878
And last you need a seat reservation .	-2.7695
Because the " comfort check-in " works so you can get into the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-3.5847
The test customers then appear a button for electronic devaluation .	-2.8693
The train companions get a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and takes the booked seat Y .	-4.4174
He knows that there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-3.5747
So you can sleep , continue working , silently sil .            	-4.2922
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should use passengers .	-3.2123
" Those who want to travel without ticket control through our train staff simply check in the DB Navigator .	-3.4131
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personally " , says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB TV .	-3.2940
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-2.7317
Anyone who often trains knows that , alongside delays and missed trains , ticket controls belong to the biggest angers .                	-4.3995
Because you often have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets , in  any case but you  do  n  t h  t h .  T . T .	-6.1009
Either the credit card or the personnel identification card or otherwise a document needed to be presented .	-4.0771
The consequences are endless discussions between train passengers and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the department or large area and delays in the control of their own ticket and the creator takes the time to care about other concerns .	-4.9943
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-1.8590
This is only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-2.6576
Further train numbers on the same route have not yet been unlocked .	-2.5918
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Whose Streets ? "	-1.9160
On 9 August 2014 Brittany Ferrell was shaken until its core .	-2.2056
Only one day after arriving in New York City , the born in St. Louis was on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that she rented and scrolled by Facebook on her phone .	-3.0425
She stumbled on a post of someone from the High School .	-2.2547
" The police has just killed a 18-year-old child , and it is still on the road " , it was there .	-2.7036
Confused because nobody had posted the information on her feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-2.5525
A user with Handle @ TheePharoah was constantly retreated on their timeline .	-2.2317
The rapper from the territory of St. Louis was the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo . , live to tweet .	-3.5503
He posted an image of brown ’ s lifeless body , which was extended on the street and would remain there four hours .	-3.2010
" That is wild " , thought Ferrell with himself .	-2.3891
But the death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.7709
She laid her mobile phone to return tweets to the Canfield drive later in the evening .	-3.0676
There were photos of the police band and people who scribed , and by a man who claimed to be Browns Father , who was a shield with the label : " Fergusons Police has just killed my unarmed son ! "	-3.7249
She observed a live feed in which a policeman was before a group of demonstrators with a light dog .	-3.2282
In another video , she said that a different policeman ensured his gun and screen : " I will kill you all ... Animals . "	-4.7382
" That is not common , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-2.4443
" That is not the kind of murder that we have used to and which we can call typical . "	-2.9769
At this moment I felt shake frost .	-2.4139
I was angry and wine ' .	-1.7966
She booked a return flight and went home next day .	-2.0737
After the landing at 23 p.m. she hold her 6-year-old daughter from the house of her father and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-3.6291
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary film , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11th ce .	-2.7486
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance , which consists of people who live in the Community and filled the streets to demand answers .	-3.9313
As a ferrell with her daughter , who weared a flower cloth and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had numerous times before this morning » about the black experience and the black condition « .	-5.1612
" You remember , as I taught you , when black people must fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-2.9238
" We are going to Ferguson now because the police has killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.7609
I could not take them " said Ferrell later .	-1.8488
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.0847
It must be aware of it and seen it and be pulled out into it .	-4.0244
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-3.0781
Even though I have the luck to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience a blatant racism , she is not different from the next black child .	-3.9294
I feel I would prove a bad service to keep them far . '	-2.4816
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road , a place towards the police authority , which became a camp area when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-3.3915
There , Ferrell and her daughter connected to a local business holder who made lunch .	-3.1115
They prepared pockets and help to pass them on demonstrators .	-2.1646
Slowly , a new type of activism for Ferrell shape began to accept .	-2.2187
" My activism changed after 9 August totally , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St . Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on Essens justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.1152
" I had no experience in organizing .	-2.2726
Everything has come . '	-1.4916
Weeks later , Ferrell met one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan .	-2.0917
Folayan said that she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.4175
A question came ferrell in the sense : " Do you want to document or try to find a story that you can exploit ?                       	-3.4959
This scepticism was nurtured by innumerable cases of people , often by white , in a community that benefited from their pain and their resilience .	-2.8897
As Folayan recently said in an interview : ' We had heard that people who have born and grown in Ferguson have not centered their voices and we wanted to make it different . '	-3.0480
Folayan had already worked with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the area known for his activism around death routes .	-7.5090
His commitment , Ferrell , brought the project closer together with six other locals , followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years to Brown 's shot .	-3.4065
" This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us , " said  Davis .	-2.8135
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , for that is how I will be displayed . "	-4.0024
The objective was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement ' is not a Messias leader but a community that meets ' , said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-3.5918
As a result , documents of " Whose Streets ? " surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life , as she loves and marries her wife .	-2.6886
" I felt like naked " , said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-2.1100
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people .                        	-3.6439
Furthermore , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives movement .	-2.4107
Two of the three founders of the movement , which , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , characterized the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.6396
" Black , gay women in management positions have borne the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-3.1148
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . '	-1.9825
Folayan agreed to note that ' the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women ' .	-2.3092
However , it insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " where Ferrell was selected as a heart of the film because of its identity .	-3.2197
" She was the person who supplied this energy " she said .	-2.4995
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because a life of these crossings is so much at stake in a black , gay            w w  s .          	-4.4847
You can feel your energy through the screen . "	-1.8764
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial connections between the community and the po c r co c c  c   .	-3.5722
Ferrell is due to proven for 2 <unk> years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.0846
It describes the social policy atmosphere of the area , which it calls its home : " A chaos " .	-3.7033
However , she clamps into a singing and feels committed to this memory since three years ago in Ferguson .	-3.6433
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-1.2241
It is our duty to win .	-1.0656
We must love and support each other .	-1.1149
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-1.7264
From " Dream " to " Size Championship " : Readers discuss bit gallery	-2.2670
The bit gallery moves people , although it is still not built .	-2.9653
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone since the first presentation of 2009 divides the population into advocates and opponents .	-3.0025
Cold leaves the subject hardly any .	-2.5901
Also on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " will be discussed .	-2.5636
While those who say one to the bit gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole Shows ) , comes from the other side : " No man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Size Championship ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-4.2659
While the supporters build on the fact that a gallery draws more customers into the city , which also benefits the other shops , the opponents fear that the pedestrian zone then bloods out .	-4.0666
In addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the property on which the farm hall is on which 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-3.6398
With the beginning of the construction work this will be ended .	-2.9069
The Gallery Makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with the opportunity to integrate o                 	-4.3035

We also discovered the metzgerei for us .	-2.9844
We would like to see a chance of maintaining this offer during and , above all , after the construction of the gallery .	-3.3337
In other cities , there is also that .	-2.5389
Above all , the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-2.0190
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers located in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of rent .	-3.1394

Whether clothing , shoes , drug or supermarkets : I find it superfluous .	-2.8400
There is already enough in our c .	-2.2604
You see how many shops here are empty - some have been and years for months .	-3.6121
But , as there is not even a proper weekly market , it is all the more important that we at least have the market hall .	-4.9840
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly directly offered by the producer and is also cheap .	-3.2971
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rentals there are often no possible for a retailer .	-3.9341
Pity , special business there is almost no longer and what is still remaining will probably disappear . "	-4.1151
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit together for me .	-2.2604
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.8442
Above all , where should the farmers ' hall be during the construction time ?	-3.1151
The old Edeka would be the solution , even if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-2.7044
Or does it create the spectre bit gallery beforehand to drive all shops from Bitburg ?  "	-3.5275
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-1.7882
And a shopping center that is empty needs no one .	-2.3503
In my view , it would have been better to promote a proper farmer market instead of this gallery .	-2.4756
But there is no place for a farmer hall thanks to the madness of many - as I find - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-3.5828
When the farmers ' hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . '	-2.8055
An appropriate similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-2.1573
In the middle of the space of Fridman Gallery in New York , many faces are seen - white , black and brown , which are almost interesting to cables hanging on the ceiling .	-5.9897
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupfern and Haarschnitten , who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.1169
Manning sent the cuts from the prison Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst sent a 35-year-old penalty after making it public as secretly classified diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.1397
The new exhibition opened on August 2 means A Becoming Resemblance ( A suitable similarity ) .	-2.4609
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and manning , a transfer and dissident whose conviction was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days into his office .	-3.9895
Dewey-Hagborg has created a sharp , if something intellectual , intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data , but also identity from the DNA ’ s algorithmic analysis , which has been extracted by manning and the  3 portraits .	-4.6819
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has already spoken openly about identification as a woman since its puberty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 charges , including six violations of the Spy Act , Computer Fraud and Theft .	-3.4302
Through the prison , their image was suppressed , so much that there was only one photo - a great , black-white selfie in which manning sits uncomfortably on a driver seat and wears a platinum blonde period - with which it was associated .	-5.0607
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.5848
This produced the artist Portraits of strangers from Forensian artifacts such as cigarettes and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from waste to make an image of how these people could look .	-5.1822
That was the time she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.0349
" They led an interview with Chelsea Manning , while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article " , said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.1505
And it could not be visited at this time and it could not be photographed , so take contact with Chelsea and asked if it wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.0406
The artist and her imprisoned museum were unequal letters who exchanged several letters over two years .	-2.9561
They even created a Comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which predicted a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and able to see the exhibition personally .	-3.2953
The fact that Obama was indeed only a few days after the book was published that Manning ’ s release would call for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy combination .	-3.6651
There is also something deep and strong in the opening of the exhibition , since Donald Trump leads a war against informants from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , viable ways to flourish the rigid divisions that he should actually resolve .	-4.5937
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing by all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-2.9581
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for her excessive signature ( the " i " in her family name is ended with a heart ) an end to the " automatic fragmentation whose basis was gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-4.4489
On the opposite wall , their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feet of Cs and Gs and As , is written in pencil .	-3.0602
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all in t b                                            	-4.8160
" What people will hopefully take away is that our genome does not take care of who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are " , said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen                   .  I  wi a m t .	-4.8717
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are " .	-2.1266
The last piece in the exhibition stored in a space is a page from the above mentioned comic novelle .	-2.9537
It shows manning how it appears in the hands of the United States ' disciplinary branches such as King-Kong .	-3.5610
" If they cold your speech , then they won " , it means .	-2.5652
" So never keeps the mouth " .	-1.9465
" It came directly from a letter that she wrote me " , the artist who welcomed from Philadelphia .	-2.6983
" I still get geese skin when I talk about it " .	-2.9072
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as previously appeared in the Comic Book - but if she should do so , she will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the space , by their own genomic simulations that combine together like the hordes of protesters .	-5.0665
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , manning stature ) where their genetic haplographs were written with pencil .	-3.5761
" In the past I had her wall , but I wanted to feel like a volume of human beings " , said Dewey-Hagborg from the portraits .	-3.7484
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed itself with Chelsea , as the movement behind its liberation . "	-2.8610
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford f          k           	-3.5049
A country-wide hunting is under way for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are seeking as suspects , after a man had been stumbled in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .	-5.6055
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murders because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as the acts of the Cook County Court show .	-3.2797
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several sticks .	-2.1450
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corpse was discovered on 27 July .	-2.1189
Officials received a call , came at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.8290
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared at the place of what happened , and detectives examine the sticks as a murder , while the police actively looks for the two suspects , said officials .	-3.8968
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.0407
Alan K. Cubbage , the Vice-President of University Relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been leaved and was excluded from the entering of the campus of Northwestern University .	-3.5707
" This is now a criminal matter that is investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates with this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.0833
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the Oxford University .	-3.0943
A spokesman of the University and the Summerville College said in an e-mail declaration that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in any way that is concerne . '	-4.1455
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted to see himself .	-2.8858
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said that he strongly asked the suspects to face the authorities .	-4.4928
" The police has an idea of its place of residence , and our efforts to localize them are strengthening , " said Guglielmi .	-2.7814
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities help to find suspects .	-1.7889
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a puzzling tip that said that something has happened in 1008 .	-3.4848
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-1.2547
Guglielmi said it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.0094
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-1.9209
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship " , said Guglielmi .	-1.8910
The management team of Grand Plaza published a declaration to the inhabitants : " The police is currently working on the time axis and the background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident " .	-3.5552
" We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future " - Russian Vice-Premier Mutko	-3.0913
Russian Vice-Premier Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long until the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) are implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-2.9485
" At a specific stage of fulfilment of the roadmap criteria , RUSADA has received the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-2.8808
The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect " , explained Mutko on Thursday .	-2.1704
The PM commented the second part of the WADA roadmap to comply with the code describing the criteria for the re-use of RUSADA and recently published on the organization website .	-3.4265
According to Mutko , he contains nothing that could give cause for Russia .	-2.7477
" Everything has been announced , everything is implemented .	-1.7575
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.1837
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the dopings approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer , Richard McLaren , on supported government-supported doping in Russian sport                          	-4.9633
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : " We carry out the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake .	-3.2405
All measures have been implemented .	-1.2837
But there were no government programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . '    .  '       . ' I	-3.2452
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the Head of the Independent Russian Anti-Doping Commission .	-2.2955
In conversation with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov added problems of the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .   ' W h r st             	-4.3974
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally , " Smirnov added .	-2.4835
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 as part of the doping scandal .	-2.7232
However , you were allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.2639
After a visit to the main quarter of the organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director Olivier Niggli explained that RUSADA is moving in the right direction " to be used again .	-3.3548
Aldi No Longer Sells Eggs	-2.0934
This was the company 's groups .	-5.3627
This is a purely precautionary measure , which cannot be affected by any health impairment , said in the communication .	-4.0511
Only eggs should be delivered to Aldi immediately , which have been tested negatively to fipronile anti-rubber resources .	-4.3636
Aldi wants to produce clarity and transparency in his customers .	-2.2111
The Start-ups that will help your company not become the next ups	-4.8378
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness at your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys did not work .	-2.7140
Answers were often vague , little helpful or - worse - fraudulent .	-1.8556
Even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-2.0348
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity " , said Errett , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-2.6620
She has called people from outside to help .	-1.6465
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is at the growth to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-2.7603
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to carry out surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allowing whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite leadership and turn directly to the Administrative Board .	-4.3320
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for the persecution of their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive by Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees     c .	-3.2525
Errett said that they won a better insight into what your employees think and feel with glint in the three years .	-2.9205
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company which shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which leaders have low consent results - so you can drill off why .	-4.0848
Companies come to recognize that the top of job culture must remain , so that you have not become the next uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post that describes an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-4.6839
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.5752
The global governance , regulation and compliance industry could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial technical website Let 's Talk Pa    .	-2.7240
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies to prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the middle of the upper case .	-3.6270
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.5993
Uber recently registered as a client .	-2.3038
Like Glint , Convercent companies leave customized " pulse " surveys , gather confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-3.5144
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.8793
And if the main manager is involved , complaints are directly involved in the Supervisory Board .	-2.5386
" The court of public opinion has regulated " , said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.6631
When a company is found which its employees are poorly treated or unethically behaved , it can experience costly consequences by consumer boycott , worker fluctuation and complaints , Quinlan said .	-4.1532
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way of achieving their company centre .	-3.2753
In the past , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he had to find a formal complaint or email for the corporate centre , and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.4785
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to pursue the complaints of employees .	-3.1547
Well , because the company uses Convercent , problems hidden and addressed previously by leaders who were hidden in cities or states in offices , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice .	-4.1131
" I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of employment , " said Vitrano , which leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.1608
'And we protect our shareholders from employment legal disputes ' .	-2.0405
Companies started to take more seriously ethics , values and employee engagement in 2002 after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical infringements by the Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-3.3032
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundering went online .	-2.7544
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy " , he said .	-2.0608
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring fees for the use of their products .	-2.8550
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital Investors that have supported both startups .	-4.5539
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , increasing the entire capital to $ 47 million .	-2.8316
Glitzern safeguarded $ 10 million in November by Bessemer Venture Partners and brought its entire funding to $ 60 million .	-2.6810
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.3265
There is an increasing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more than they have been .	-3.3196
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only operations .	-2.1904
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and estimated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-2.5488
" If people are happy to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you are worthwhile , they feel more obliged to make this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , who uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.8165
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies are going well , and companies will  run well when employees are usi and   committed .	-3.9608
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-2.8415
The data about employee engagement according to the experts of job culture important .	-3.0620
But the data is useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-2.2353
Indeed , if a company asks employees about your feedback , it may have an expectation that change is on the way .	-2.6292
And if the change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .	-3.0408
" If you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 discussions " , said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , who has seen companies that have left too much on the collection of data .	-3.4653
" Because if you will not follow staff , " Have you really heard me ?	-2.6206
Do you take care of this ?	-1.6236
And if you do not take care of why should I ? '	-2.0080
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly employee surveys , was able to take measures on the same day when a problem is reported on glint , was   s salvation .	-4.1295
And after the collection of feedback of frustrated employees , it was able to reorganize several teams within the company and add communication training to the problems .	-3.0769
At Ruby Tuesday , the company always receives new insights about employees , and it hopes that in the long term this leads to a better link between workers in an industry known for high turnover .	-4.0140
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.9710
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.5273
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-1.7636
NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for Bruins	-2.3996
There is a lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new exercise fields of the team on the campus .	-3.4487
Some have excluded their tricoto parts and showed the back full of welding from the first day of the training camp .	-2.9839
For a good part of the team , these inactive minutes represent a lunch break .	-2.6659
Players who are integrated into the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center next morning .	-3.4393
" This is the next three days a genuine tree mill for the boys , " said Bruins trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.5141
NCAA eliminates two-day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and it has actually extended its days - at least until Friday .	-7.4014
Therefore , the first three trainings of the UCLA should start at 19 : 15 hours to meet the timetables of the players already packed .	-3.6795
The compromise away from the two days is more than one day when the bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six times in Westwood .	-4.5340
They should hold 18 exercises during the course of August .	-2.8510
Mora said that he supported the NCAA regulation , even if they add another point to the multi-employed routes of the players .	-3.4757
" We put this enormous burden on three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.6095
" And they simply pressed it , they place themselves , they are great people .	-2.3149
I think if we come until Saturday and we have more time , it is really great . '	-3.1565
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is completed , which will not be an easy task in view of the clear views of its fields by an adjoining car park and the adjoining Luskin Center , given the clear visibility of its fields by an adjoining ca park and the adjacent Luskin Centre , a hote of the highe c                                                    	-6.1836
Bruins players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there would be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-2.9761
" We will use our security " , said Mora .	-1.5618
" This is a real problem , and it is not far recognized to think that people rent a room there and then choose to record an exercise .	-3.8320
If you have the video band of an exercise , it is a rather good business .	-3.4396
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-1.8787
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.3035
I am therefore not too much concern about this .	-2.6923
We have a plan . '	-0.9586
Facebook wants to intensify factual reviews	-9.4205
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to third-party factual checkers and then display their results under the original contribution , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , it is   one of his efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-4.3820
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start with the use of updated machine learning methods to see possible false messages and to send them to factual checkers that may view results of the factual examination from the original article .	-4.1677
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of whom believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .	-2.7141
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French electorate in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan for which social media networks should be punished if they do not manage to eliminate hateful postings as before the elections there in September .	-4.2149
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate declaration in German that a test of the new factual review is launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.0160
" In addition to the recognition of the stories of fact reviewers of third parties , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-3.4843
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the " article " connected and works on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong news .	-3.1540
Creating a Comic Roman : A Castle in England	-1.8703
In his younger past , the small Scotney Castle was in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970 ’ s and 1980 ’ s .	-3.0325
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from its cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become the inspiration for a graphical novel of Jamie Rhodes , a mophagus Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.5257
" I find it so beautiful to look at the handscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says foolish .	-3.3347
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands " .	-2.4295
'A Castle in England ' reveals the time from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-3.2301
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' in 2014 , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional   .	-2.7475
" I only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700 ’ s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-3.4084
" That is his thumb pressure !	-1.8652
And letters always reach smoke , because then there was a fire because of the light .	-3.3517
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he himself were .	-2.2790
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.3279
For someone who beaten so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued " ) , this seems to be too beautiful .	-3.9738
Rhodos spent his days with exploring the Victorian castle , through the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hyane heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the graves .	-4.0632
He migrated through the area and the ruins of the old castle and spoke to the landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-3.6307
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and began to write " .	-2.3573
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust only received full access in 2006 when the last heritage , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-2.7112
When Rhodes entered a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said " Oh , it turned it on the roof " .	-4.2184
Diaries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who was wrong : " You could think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-4.3941
Young , let everything go his course ! "	-2.5450
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive on a broader basis into the English history , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who relies the newly built castle in order to join the farm 's reputation of 1381 .	-4.6077
" There is a record of a turmoil that occurred in 1380 in this book with the title ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.0330
" The farm uprising began in this area and I thought that an uprising was a good beginning .	-2.5857
Perhaps the two are connected ? '	-1.9729
Other stories are rooted in the history of the castle - such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuit Pater , which the family Darrell hidden for seven years during English reformation .	-3.2999
Or ' The Smuggler ' , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell was displayed from the 18th century , who started his own cure by filling a cast with stones ( a discovery that was only years later discovered when his castle was excavated ) .	-4.7962
The darrels are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : ' The gentlemen seemed to be fair gauners , make debts and spend money on things they could not afford .	-3.7717

Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.3219
Each year at the beginning of August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) about pensions and transportations in the Officer Corps .	-3.7713

Since the failed coup , Erdogan head fired the 326 generals and Admirals in 169 .	-4.6433
More than 10,000 soldiers have been removed from the series of the army - mostly because of alleged links to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as a wire drawing of the coup trial .	-4.0929
486 people who have been involved immediately in the coup attempt will be negotiated in Ankara since this week .	-3.4274
Even on the day after the coup , Erdogan had described the overthrow as " God Gift " as he gave him the opportunity to clean the armed forces " fully " .	-4.0546
But does Erdogan really have the army in control ?	-1.8626
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article with the heading " Unehagen in the Military Quarter " .	-2.5457
In the general staff , there are concerns about an increasing ' Islamization ' of the army , which , among other things , manifested themselves in the lifting of the headscarf ban for soldiers , wrote the newspaper .	-4.0051

Before the end of the year , the tourist train is supposed to be built on the marodial track .	-4.8327
In order to ensure the future of the race shuttle in the long term , construction work should begin this year after the Transport Ministry indicates tha  t s . T c  .	-5.0253
" With the decision to order and restore the Ilmenau race route , the country commits itself to this mainly important connection to tourism , " explained transport secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-4.0342
The cost of employing the route was about EUR 2.5 million .	-3.3185
Of this sum , the country takes 75 % .	-2.1401
The Treaty , on which the shuttle should be ordered by the country in future , is currently being definitively coordinated , explained so  .	-3.7933
The Ministry and South Thuringia as an operator are already agreed on the technical details .	-3.0155

The Rise of Sex Robots is real and we should be concerned .	-4.5132
A new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots is precisely when you thought that it cannot be more crazy in 2017 .	-4.6526
Yes , indeed .	-0.8514
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-1.7149
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .	-2.3011
According to Noel Sharkey , emerited professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start to take their rise seriously .	-4.1421
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , his form of breast wart and the type of fingernail .	-2.8049
" The people take themselves fun , but companies provide a great deal of it , and we will get them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey in publishing his new report .	-5.5609
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warmly - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.1408
The user can also customize its robots according to its convictions and select everything from the eye color of the robot through the form of breast warts to the type or the color of its fingernails .	-3.9993
But it will be even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that a stepford woman would look progressive .	-3.1791
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-2.2164
The RealBotix robot allows , for example , their users to adapt their robots to the properties they find accordingly , such as hypocrisy .	-3.5199
And then there are the Roxxxy gold sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah , which gives the impression of shocks and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-3.6807
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality adapted to your personality as good as possible " warms the website of True Companion .	-2.6393
She likes what you like , and it does not like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.7869
She also has its moods over the day - like real people !	-2.8111
It can be tired , fixed on conversation or it can be " in mood " ! "	-2.5160
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subject female characteristics , the rape attacks , when you go to Frigid ( meaning here : resisting ) Farrah , worries one most .                                   	-6.0147
On his website True Companion Roxxxy with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.5404
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxy ? " do it mean on the si .	-2.8818
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or only keep another sex toy .	-2.8793
Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjection as optional addition .	-4.0883
Most men will , of course , not keep sex robots , and while the FRR comments on its increasing popularity , they remain provisionally on the edge of consumer culture .	-3.8127
But what sends out of the peripheral zones can be very lessonable in relation to the spirit of the time we live    .	-3.3522
And many people are not strange or offensive until they give the free market permission to t t              	-3.1827
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots appear at a time when women 's rights are threatened worldwide in which there is a president in the White House who has sexually attacked women .	-3.5944
The most deterrent aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphical images , the sweeping body and the outstood eyes , but as realistic this vision works .	-4.2840
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .	-3.6830
The objective behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( albeit with Pornostar proportions ) .                    	-3.2333
Their builders want them to feel humanly that they found the movement of a real body .	-2.6702
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , the robots are not real women .	-2.4833
They cannot separate from their companion or simply discount .	-4.2168
They have no conciliation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disturb the imagination of total subjection .	-2.8817
In other words , they are complacent slaves .	-2.2654
Or to express it in the 2017 speech : service girls	-2.1725
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.2798
He makes Mitt Romney the Inclusion of Healthy Sense	-2.1701
It has become a wisdom of Trump era that the political divisions that have polarized the US electorate have also divided families into small format                         	-4.3062
Around Christmas and Harvesting Festival , there were newspapers in the United States with advice about how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s e e                  	-4.3390
We are all supposedly strict to place our filter bubbles .	-2.9519
Less noted , Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.1383
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family this week in New York .	-3.3592
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect . T I  have  a     s co  . T     	-5.3053
With Trump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republican relatives that had fought for decades because of politics , is suddenly and quite suitably on the same side .	-4.5859
This is certainly a good thing about the dining table , but in another context I find it considerable risks .	-3.7649
The left was strengthened by Trump , but the effects of his presidency have the strength of putting us all on the right .	-3.0434
When we talk about ' normalisation ' and Trump , we refer to the great opportunity that one day his girls will no longer be removed .	-4.1720
However , there is an even more appalling long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right ' normalized ' , which suddenly appear to be reasonable compared with his standards .	-3.9132
Today I find myself of an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urcomic version of the crazy - the dog on the roof , which 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration saw ) - which in fact happened compared to Trump to one as very mild crimes .	-4.8615
When Trump is at stake , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify itself as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.0245
When my cousine was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in the Central Park , the largest of the New York park department , and the best three dollars you can spend in the city if you don 't need a coffee .	-3.5747
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are consistent and the animals are turning to look full of fear about their own shoulders - extremely dark and climpering music conveys this in a s strange wa       .            a s . T .      T .	-5.5838
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines are trusted to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not fair to the dream .	-3.4170
Five thirty years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a great roundabout in north London .	-4.3046
However , the Central Park Karussell is still a strange magical experience , since two years old , a 11-year-old , and two women in the 40 ’ s can go on it and all have a great time .	-4.4372
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked for tha            .	-3.1282

Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hospital , which he suffered from prison authorities in his cell .	-3.5843
Pistorius was condemned for murder after an appeal from the prosecutors to a first dead sentence .	-3.3778
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine Day in 2013 by shooting them on several times by a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-4.0203
Pistorius claimed that he regarded his girlfriend as a nightly intruder hiding in the cabin .	-3.2634
The prosecutors have announced their intention to insert this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius Appeal from which they say that they are too literal      .	-3.8851
The National Law Prosecution Authority said that it would be objected to the Supreme Court of South Africa and the objection can be heard this year .	-3.3807
Pistorius runs the risk of increasing its penalty to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful .      T                       	-4.5918

School Angelika Sitte welcomed parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental House in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-3.0401
As a symbol of school redundancy , the 29 students of the four classes under the leadership of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle growing in the chicken house , but then released into freedom .	-4.1190
To do this , the mountain Shar led a musical with the title " The Adler in the Chicken Hof " .	-3.8328

We Make the City Lifestyle	-2.3663
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city master , goes in pension next year .	-2.6143
The place has already been written - but suitable applicants are rare .	-2.8335
For 31 years Wacker has been the city mayor  .	-2.7853
And the work still makes him great fun as he communicates in the press conversation .	-3.0533
He reports of varied tasks , but also demanding tasks that wait for his successors .	-3.0880
At the same time , it wonders that so far no application does not meet the requirements .	-2.8421

In this way , when it comes to regular terms of termination , there should be still enough time for introducing the p .	-4.9598
Since Haslach functions the administrative community as a lower construction authority , the applicant must provide conclusions .	-3.8650
Because this function wants to keep the city in any case .	-2.0781
If it were no longer able to fill it , the citizens would have to go to Offenburg  to  d                 	-3.6923
But citizens are close to the city and himself , says Wacker , who reports from a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and citizens .	-3.4281
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have collected , looking back onto the wackers .	-3.3180
" We make the city lifeworth " , it is safe about the construction office and its employees .	-3.1312
But in future there are also varied projects on the agenda : transforming the former Hukla area and the Niederhofen parking space .	-9.7150
The bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still subject .	-3.4171
The latter alone will be booking with approximately EUR 1.5 million when we make ' s right ' , Wacker estimates wackers .	-3.5932

Design is available for an urban mayor of large space .	-3.1298
Haslach ’ s own construction and gardenery can be responded to many things rather flexibly .	-3.6835
" You can move much " , said wackers , and the design of the green facilities is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-3.1268
Since the old town is under monument protection , it is important to have " an eye of what is purely clean " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city mayor emphasizes  .                	-5.1055
Anyway , the city mayor bears high responsibility .	-3.0173
He is Bauherr , " At the end of the thing runs about my table " .	-3.1077
In care and coordination he can count on long-term employees : Markus Neumaier ( high-construction ) has been here for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( deep building ) for 15 years .	-6.6842
Also , his successor remains long , Wacker wishes : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place " .	-3.6922
Because continuity is not only important for a good operating climate but also for the further design of the city .	-2.5567
Those who want to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to provide a complete study as a diploma engineer or bachelor with professional architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building and construction law .	-4.1588

Near the Tatort were witnessed a rosarote roller and a bicycle driver .	-3.7304
" This goes far beyond a lausbubble company " , said OBB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA .	-3.4647
The perpetrators or perpetrators would have brought themselves into great danger and also jeopardised train traffic .	-3.4938
In addition to the damage to the lock and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement could also have ponals from the rail customers to the perpetrators .	-5.0970
Overall , the spokesman said that the spokesperson said that there was a " considerable " sum .	-4.3780
The damage was restored on Friday afternoon , without disabilities .	-4.0014
Nearly ten passenger trains were falling out Friday morning , two of which concerned the transport                	-4.2437
Freight goods did not exceed , but they were late .	-2.7677

Red meat , dairy products and chocolate could help to alleviate IBD ( inflammatory disease )	-2.5264
Red meat and chocolate can sound for your digestive system like a nightmare .	-1.7817
But a new study claims precisely the opposite : a diet that is rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory diseases .	-3.1068
The incurable state of around 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United States is causing struggles and bleedings , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue             i               	-4.9450
While the people concerned usually get to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers found at the Washington University emerged that the essential amino acid helped develop immune cells that promote a tolerant darm .	-4.7383
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the darm to ensure that harmful microbes that hide in eating do not enter the body .                        	-4.0927
Cells that are able to trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues .	-2.5684
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation , it can result inflammatory disease .	-2.6142
Experiments noted that some kind of tolerance promotes immune cells in mices which carry a specific bacterium in their own ownership .	-4.4680
And the bacterium requires tryptophane - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the image of the cells .	-3.4374
Professor Colonna said : " We have a link between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the darm microbiom and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-2.9606
The more tryptophane had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells .	-2.3505
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and promotes a rich diet tolerant , less inflammatory , if the same system works in people .	-3.7820
Post Doctorandin Dr Luisa Cervantes-Barragan studied a kind of immune that promotes tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was separately housed , did not have t .	-4.3437
It suggested that the difference had to do with the darmic robiots of mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and mushrooms that normally live in the magnificent tract .	-3.6407
The nails of mice were sequenced and six types of bacteria were found in mice with the immune cells , but without them lacked in mice .	-4.8569
Mice have been drawn up in a sterile environment so that they lacked a darm crobiom and they did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-3.7247
To understand how the bacteria had on the immune system , researchers L. reuteri were growing in a liquid and then transferred small amounts of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by mice .	-3.4932
Immune cells developed to the tolerance cells .	-4.6223
When the active component was cleaned from liquid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 milk acid .	-2.6958
If researchers doubled the amount of tryptophane in the fodder of mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 percent , but if the tryptophane values have been halved , the number of cells declined by half                     	-4.2445
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-supporting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our stomach darm tracts .	-3.6678
It is not known whether tryptophane by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in people as developing as with mice , but defects in genes relating to tryptophane have been found in people with inflammatory d 'i .	-4.8172
She said : ' The development of these cells is probably something that we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the darm .	-2.9522
Potentially , high tryptophan values can lead to the extension of this population in the present of L. reuteri . "	-2.9300
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a Genius with Nemanja Matic .	-4.0394
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.4221
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super-Cup begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role when people such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira started to love .	-3.9723
Matic , however , was excluded from the preparatory Asia-Asia-Tournee of the Blues and created only 45 minutes , admitting Mourinho that he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-3.6725
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football " , said Mourinho .	-2.1060
" We will help him be prepared before later . "	-3.6017
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started at the Aviva Stadium , when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season .	-3.1949
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three other recommitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic work " to meet three of his four priority reobligations .	-4.0314
" Three of four to get , for which I thank the club " , he added him .	-3.4007
" I will be more happy when they get four of me four , but they have given themselves great trouble . "	-2.8030
Boeing " painted " Dreamliner i d    H        in  Heave       	-6.1966
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner into t  s sky           . T      	-3.4534
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in US state Michigan , and withdrew in the form of a dreamliner about the US , these are several thousand kilometres .	-3.8880
The action took 18 hours and one minute .	-1.6265
On the radar screens the form of a dreamliner was to be              .	-2.6574
The whole was a test for new engines .	-2.9710
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .                 	-2.7580
Thus the number " 787 " and the boeing logo were painted in the sky .	-3.0390
The New Deep Slow for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem	-2.9114
As the wind rotates , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD head , Socialist Prime Ministers always looked to Berlin with a certain concern .	-3.8785
Merely no party central disturbance fire , not just a federal wind - the most important wish of the election campaigners was .	-5.3471
Since Martin Schulz , the party has changed fundamentally .	-2.0120
Since then , the employees from the Willy Brandt house with growing horrors have been observing the events in the SPD-ruled capitals .	-4.0055
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not be described in approach to the headwind .	-3.2638
They were low strikes .	-2.2751
And one after another .	-2.3541
The Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Green following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony .	-2.6622
" This shows once again : Red-Green can simply not rule reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-3.1937
The surprising group exit from a Green Member has crashed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-2.8954
Five months before the land election , his red-green coalition lost their one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.1825
The Green Federal Director Michael Kellner has asked the dismal November Green Member Elke Twesten to return their mandate .	-3.7186
Transgression to CDU means clear distortion of the electorate ’ s will .	-2.7888
Elke Twesten must return their mandate immediately , said the Federal Manager and Campaign Manager of the Greens to the Editorial Network of Germany ( RND ) .	-3.4623
" Everything must not be true , " is a SPD election campaigner , when the new Hiobsbotshop reaches the party centre on Friday morning .	-3.7490
Stephan Weil , Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the transgression of the Green Members of the Elke Twest to the CDU without their own majority of government .	-3.7761
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole range of large and small crises in SPD associations .	-2.5468
And nobody knows what comes next .	-1.4102
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-2.4792
A blue eye , no longer , reassured the cooperatives at the time .	-2.6200
After the Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia elections , everything will be different .	-2.2807
That was also the case - and everything became clearly worse .	-3.0631
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the daumel , the Düsseldorf discharge hundred the party smoothl  .	-4.3351
Afterwards , the cooperatives rappeled again in the weeks after  th .	-4.7170
Then when they had just created new courage , the Hamburg G-20 Summit came .	-3.5396
And with him came the next deep strike .	-2.0554
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD landscape , lost his nimbus on that weekend because he sat in Elbphilharmony while his city burned .	-3.0803
And because in crisis communication he did so fairly everything wrong , which can be done wrong .	-5.0918
Since then , Scholz fights for his political survival .	-1.7359
So now Stephan Weil .	-1.5312
Because of the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Downtown Saxony Prime Minister has been in criticism for a long time .	-3.4431
Most of these surveys have been added .	-2.4743
Nevertheless , or perhaps just that , in recent weeks , we tried to set accents in recent weeks .	-4.0353
The efforts of the former mayor of Hannover to develop his power in Berlin remained unhidden either in the environment of Martin Schu  .	-3.5267
They could grant him , because they promised to stabilize the party from where they promised t    .	-3.5269
Now the opposite could take place .	-2.4479
Basically , we do not blame the party internal section of the Dominion Greens .	-3.9678
And Schulz already not .	-2.2480
At the same time , the colleagues try to keep their own series closed .	-3.5189
Their anger is directed towards the Greens and , above all , the dismal parliamentarian , Twesten .	-3.6842
" It is intolerable and democratic , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests in the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of party links in the SPD Group , the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-3.5507
Mrs Twesten has not been elected to Parliament because of her person as a direct candidate , but about the list of the local Greens of the North Saxony Greens , so the Lower Saxony Member continues .	-4.4638
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .	-1.9897
Thomas Oppermann , Chief of the SPD Group , complains a " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-2.4530
" The will of voters four years ago was clear : people have made Stephan Weil to the prime minister " , says Oppermann , who leads the Downtown Saxony SPD as top candidate into the Federal Election , the RND .	-4.0321
" Now the personal career memory of a future CDU Member falsifies the result of the elections , " said Oppermann .	-4.6504
He asked to enlighten the backgrounds .	-2.2075
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments from the CDU Lower Saxony .	-3.5863
Support funds for local core III	-2.3460
Those who wish to renovate their homes in the years can soon get support from the country .	-3.5828
Informed Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG city development on Wednesday .	-2.4419
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a review of the previous event .	-3.4723
Since 1991 there have been reception areas .	-2.0846
At that time , in the refurbishment region I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the funding sum .	-3.5223
From 2005 to 2016 , the subsidy was still 60 % in the ref area    .                      	-4.5978
For Schindler , the previous refurbishments are a " success project " - it is finally important to promote internal development and not just to develop new construction areas .	-4.0848
On 4 April , the Karlsruhe Government Presidency received information that there will be a reorganization area III .	-3.0538
The amount of funding amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would be received by the country , the rest of t     c  m        	-3.9726
How does a refurbishment area emerge ?	-2.3408
You will examine where the " really old " houses are .	-2.8016
But it also plays a role in whether there is any interest in the planned area .	-2.9111
If necessary , the territory could then postpone again .	-3.1585
The STEG represented Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.0792
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Social City Programme , which would then be carried out .	-3.3490
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of internal cities , the improvement of residential and employment and maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-3.5541
The measures would be implemented object-related , i.e. per plot .	-2.6031
Finally , the refurbishment area would be established as a statute .	-2.7452
The granting period for funding has been running until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-3.2417
However , until September this year , the inventory would only be carried out , within the framework of which those involved in the recovery area would have a questionnaire .	-4.9403
In November or December , the statute decision should be taken as soon as possible so that next year can begin with the refurbishments .	-4.3209
Pietzschmann then declared that each local community must carry out the said investigations .	-3.5185
It is a question of evaluating urban abuses and deciding when renovation is restored and what extent .	-4.4406
It will also be registered for the respective plot of property in th   basic b .	-3.8609
Pietzschmann will come once again after receiving an image of the situation , promised them .	-3.6610
Gotzel stressed that a successful factor for the project is the participation of those involved .             	-4.0199
Therefore , there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be filled until the end of the summer holidays .	-3.7206
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and plot arc " , which is about the construction state and the refurbishment intentions .	-3.9327
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Housing Arc " , information can be made on size , division and residents of a housing area .	-3.7187
The blue " operating arc " is only to fill out when operating in the building .	-3.1625
However , Gotzel pointed out that a filled questionnaire is not at the same time a request for funding .	-2.8766
Moreover , new construction measures are not encouraging .	-2.1026
Schindler still emphasised that the distribution of funds after the " wind hound principle " works - who is first coming for the first time , meals first .	-4.6940
You cannot reserve any support funds for later r " b " .      	-4.6232
Finally , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were shown to make the present a refurbishment " tasteful " .	-3.5508
British Inventors are setting themselves a microchip to come with a hand movement in houses and cars	-3.4602
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip so that he can open his doors , enter his office and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.2080
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointer fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology through his company BioTeq .	-3.1578
He has merged with Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthesist in the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out under medical standards .	-3.9533
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.2908
Mr. Northam 's company also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-3.1201

The White House ’ s White Promotional Costs Taxpayers	-2.0956
The White House ’ s decision to fly a marine helicopter to the South Lawn for an event that American manufacture highlights last month costs taxpayers according to the indications of the military that have been left to the TIME magaz           u  $    2    ,       ,	-3.9878
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-2.8681
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence and White House officials made a tour through products from all 50 countries .	-2.4838
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht from Maine , a firewehraut from Wisconsin and a fork from Mississippi .	-3.8716
The military office of the White House required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , little 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-3.7190
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility " , the commander of HMX-1 wrote on the evening of its event , the deputy marine commander for aviation .	-3.7073
The message showed that the helicopter was on July 17 at 7 a.m. on the South Lawn for the event at 15 a.m. and so long remained until the grasses were cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 o     t  . T '                  	-5.2478
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would be needed for the return flight because of the limitation of services .	-3.5404
The original flight crew was during the event at the helicopter , while the security staff of the unit remained on the ground during the aircraft .	-3.9475
The records made available from the TIME did not clearly show whether a second flight crew was u e  .	-5.5342
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.2518
Rows show that HMX-1 has asked whether the event might violate the provision .	-3.4292
" A question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-2.7458
" Sounds as if you are closed " , the deputy commander responded .	-1.8746
The event " Made in America " was described as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.4261
But official events also have political upper tones .	-1.5032
At the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was going on in the Senate and he propagated the efforts to contain government rules .	-3.7549
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon from politically beneficial purposes .	-2.4784
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-1.7803
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.1486
Trump carried out an investigation in February when presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of reports complaining about the use of presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-3.8373
" The White House is enthusiastic of the show " Made In America " - the products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials " , said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.1030
HMX-1 occupations often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn in order to stop US presidents in the White House with precise centimetre rates .	-3.8183
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , HMX-1 in the White House carried out 58 exercise landings .	-2.8323
The flight for the " Made in America " event included in the training requirement of the flight crew for the month , said a servant .	-4.1093
Helicopter units also flew 11 hours this day for ' Non-Presidential Support Missions ' .	-2.2654
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden for none of the other requisites presented on the event .	-2.4534
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-3.1969
HMX-1 does not maintain budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-2.7280
According to US Defence Ministry of Defence for the financial year 2017 , however , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is $ 24.380 per flight   .	-3.6089
Recordings of the unit record the aircraft ’ s aircraft as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.7531
The White House argues that the actual costs of the helicopter are far below this rate .	-2.4969
" The cost of taxpayers based on estimates for refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.0223
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs contained in the annual means . "	-3.1172
According to an RAND study from 2015 , the refunds for DoD do not include the costs of staff , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract . T a s c .	-4.4812
At this time , the former press speaker of the White House , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-3.1612
" The idea is to present this week things manufactured in America " , said Spicer   .	-2.0182
" And I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud of their contribution to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people , are dependent on this .	-3.3869
And I think how most Americans are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked untirely .	-2.7047
It is , of course , appropriate to highlight this . '	-1.9101
It was not clear whether Trump was interacting with the helicopter when he entered his tour on the South Lawn for the event , but he set himself in the driving se of a  f fire         .	-4.1679
In the White House , Trump talked about representatives of Sikorsky and pushed the media about his own fleet of company products .	-3.0380
" I know Sikorsky very well , " said the President , " I have three of it . "	-2.3475

Cooking is still outside house : A caterer takes over this task and supplies fresh cooled cooling .	-4.0826
The city operates in the Krefeld area 46 children 's day centres , 44 children get a warm meal at lunch .	-3.9528
Last kitayar , 2800 children each saw the tables , and the needs are growing continuously .	-3.7805
" Meanwhile not only children who are supported 45 weekly hours in Kita to lunch " explains pommerance .	-3.4058
" The offer also applies in 35 hour care when children remain until 14 : " .	-3.0748
46 part-time forces from 1 September cooking service : They warm the dishes delivered , complement salad , raw cost and fruit , portion the meal individually , indicate the food , relax , spill and purify the kitchen .	-5.2732
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says pomerance .	-2.5263
The size - there are two-grouping facilities as well as seven-grouped facilities - decides on the hour scope .	-4.2143
" The kitchen helpers now belong to the Kita team " , says pomerance satisfied .	-2.6957
" Thus they are much more involved and it is easier to implement educational concepts " .	-3.1111
That is also a question of healthy diets and cooking .	-3.8354
" The children should help prepare food " .	-2.7840
The direct connection of kitchen power to the team is sensible .	-2.7525
For children as well .	-2.1974
" You have a known power in the Kita , a person familiar with them , and not constantly changing people " .	-2.8076
This continuity is important for children .	-1.4473
The cleaning of the kita rooms - up to now the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .	-3.4496
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - alongside the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has proved to be the most economic comparison between the press offi    a       c r of                           o	-6.0470
And although 46 part-time forces are restored .	-2.4328
" But these hours do not fall so much into weight at around 750 people in the educational sector " , says Sonja Pommerance .	-4.0118

Men are trying to emit 13 years of girl .	-3.3751
Two young men aged 19 and 23 years should have tried to deprive a 13-year-old girl on Thursday .	-2.3845
According to the information of the police , men spoke against the 13th anniversary of the friends at the Kolpingstrasse , because they wanted to telephone with the mobile girl .	-4.3342
The 13 years rejected the request and continued with her friends .	-3.0099

GMB concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.6337
A trade union wants to confidentiality in managers of the biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term obligation to produce in her work in Glasgow .	-3.9163
GMB Scotland said that the company has silenced about the future of investment at Tollcross location .	-2.7480
More than 500 employees work in the work that produces hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse besides other products .	-3.1472
McVities owner Pladis said that he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-2.0434
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be the first to learn if their activities changed .	-3.2164
In a letter to the company ’ s filial leader , GMB Scotland McVitie ’ s called on to express " concerns that funding is not promoted for modernizing production lines " .	-3.9420
GMB Senior Organizer Drew Duffy said : ' The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross concerns deeply our members .	-3.5219
Generations of families have worked here and labour focused strongly on the local community and Glasgow , an important pillar for decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-3.2900
Therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , increasing living costs and chronic production decline , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing presence of production at McVitie .	-3.6686
A spokesman of Pladis said : " The head of Tollcross has only received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we value the continuous commitment to employees and trade union representatives .	-3.8863
Two months ago we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were openly discussed .	-2.8538
We discussed with the employees that , like all companies working in a very competitive and uncertain economic climate , we continuously reviewed our business - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - to remain competitive .	-3.9664
She added : ' In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross location , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-2.8324
We fully acknowledge the heritage of Tollcross as a production facility , and if our operating procedures change at the location , the staff and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-6.0018

La League ’ s Page May Regret its Interest in Marco Verratti	-7.0288
Paris Saint-Germain will not be destroyed in her persecution of Neymar after she has made an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago before the world ’ s record inciden ?	-4.3768
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in the summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than the double of the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .	-3.5629
After the end , Neymar will be the most expensive player in the world and the highest-paid professional sportsmen in the world .	-4.1415
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced its way to outside , even though a source near the Catalan Executive Board insists that the club has always given his best to take care of him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-4.0520
But was the football world three years ago warned by the PSG President against this prospect ?	-2.3857
When Manchester City 2014 expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every association who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.5157

" We respect all clubs .	-1.0639
But if they are trying to sign one of our players , this will have consequence .  '                    	-3.1885
Barcelona seems to have exceeded this line , with the Spanish association earlier this summer 's interest in the PSG field player Marco Verratti .	-3.3314
PSG made it clear that they would not allow the Italian international to travel under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of their prices for Neymar .	-3.2531

Interview : " Domspatzen report discharges Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger "	-2.0331
The Regensburg Domspatzen report on abuse cases discharges Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.0893
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.5188
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide for discussions .	-2.8301
Christian Weisnder , Speaker of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , explained after publication of the German Press Agency , he expected from the former Regensburg Bishop and today Kardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI , an apology .	-4.1540
It would serve very much to the reputation of the Catholic Church if Muller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own observations or their wrong assessment of the processes at that time .	-4.0639
The vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticised that in the reporting of violence in the Domspatzen , the " double standards " is measured .	-4.7832
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one doubts that they are ' shameful and shameful acts ' , which should be punished and prevented in the future , but the ' degree of media manipulation ' , the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national Italian bioethics committee .	-4.0487
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evils is already part of the everyday experience and preparing public opinion to keep this normally " , Scaraffia writes .	-4.2552
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also meant in the interview with the Bavarian broadcasting : " You are happy to go to the church and this is a found freshness " .	-4.3333
Moreover , she pointed out that in their youth 's youth ' beats a very normal educational means ' to be ready with frequent children , as I was one thing ' .	-4.3519
They would be unfair to apply today 's standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-3.2094
In connection with the reports on abuse cases , Pope Brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-2.4974
Totally wrong , author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the memory band " My Brother of the Pope " ( in 12 languages ) .	-3.2339
" I must take Georg Ratzinger in protection " , says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he assesses the results of the final report .	-2.8630
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer Ulrich Weber , the lawyer commissioned by the Bistum Regensburg ?	-3.5508
Overall , 547 Regensburg Domspatzen were abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s with high plausibility " Victims of Attacks , 67 domestic patches sexually .	-3.6707
The final report states Georg Ratzinger , who was operating in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " Summary can therefore be stated that Domkapellmeister R. in many cases applies to physical and mental violence .	-3.8586
The punishment for the students has also been more severe in terms of high emotionality .	-4.0159
Nevertheless , in contrast to many other accused , many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , despite violence , even combine positive memories with him .	-3.9423
In the interview , Hesemann declares the final report on the scandal of abuse at the Regensburg Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger 's discharge .	-3.3362
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence in protection commanders at the Regensburg Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory image of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-3.4711
On the one hand , many students highlight their " humanity "  .	-2.4617
On the other hand , he also appears as a choleric and perfectionist , who became hand-rich when a domspatz brought no top performance musi musica .	-4.7176
How do you assess this final report as its biograph ?	-2.3057
Michael Hesemann : If you are taking the trouble and reading the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger actually comes  in  t .	-4.7805
He has just devoted eight pages and it is clearly released by any suspicion of central or co-assistance in the appalling cases of sexual abuse .	-5.1923
The violence excesses at the pre-school also occurred outside its efficiency .	-3.0370
He can also be accused of having taken serious enough from this too late or first amendments .	-4.1216
The domestic engymnasium on which he worked was felt by virtually all respondents - as literally - " redemption " , " heavens " and " better world " .	-4.5632
For example , the broad majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also expresses a very excellent witness , describes him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as an extremely benign teacher who regularly supplied the youngs with cakes , checks and bonbons and " always relaxed by grapes of children " .	-5.2710
Only a minority is complaining about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which has already led to eruptions of ad .	-3.9121
He has admitted , deeply regretted and apologized for years ago , not only with chairs and thrown the key covenant on the ground , but also distributed ears and deeply regretted and apologized for this .	-5.6918
However , his honourable savings must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the time , the 1960s and 1970s , at parents like teachers .	-4.1606
Do you know such bred methods ?	-1.8701
Of course , I think of any of us born before 1968 .	-2.1840
I have also experienced this in a secular school , a government gymnasium                   	-3.1366
Compared to what is actually at stake in this report , namely the appalling sexual abuse and violence excesses on pre-school , these are , however , bagatelles .	-3.6481
There is already wondering whether it is no longer with its familiarity and role as Benedict XVI ’ s brother that many media were just on him .	-5.0764
After all , many who never understood him at the Bavarian Pope are still working hard .	-3.2354
But the truth is that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-2.6584
Much has been reported in the media in connection with the report on the issue of abuse of the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-2.9812
Will Georg Ratzinger also be putting any involvement or co-assistance in terms of sexual abuse ?	-3.4002
Michael Hesemann : quite clearly no .	-1.3829
No one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted the Domkapellmeister .	-2.4109
Not even parents were inaugurated .	-2.2602
" I never trusted me to talk to my father or my mother about it , " said a stakeholder deputy for the others , " It was all very embarrassing " .	-3.7369
The real problem in educating sexual abuse was and yet most victims of shame silence .	-2.9287
If they did not even entrust parents and siblings , then certainly does not determine a chorus leader , who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators a c work .	-4.5798
How do the Domspatzen students assess Ratzinger 's role in terms of abuse cases ?	-3.1697
Michael Hesemann : A surveyed student formulated it : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he had had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-8.4254
I think it is ... also absurd for really absurd to assume that he has opened him ... Buben more urgently or clearly than to their parents , boarding managers , trustee teachers   etc .	-4.7145
Talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable . "	-2.5796
Thus , the report comes to the very clear result : ' That students and / or their environment entrusted him in advance could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' .	-4.4676
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is therefore released by every support .	-4.2734
Nor can he be accused of not preventing him or brought to the display .	-3.3852
Therefore , there is no reason to connect its good name with these reluctant crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-2.8920
In the media , much was read by " violent excesses " at the Regensburg Domspatzen .	-2.8978
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is charged in the report ' Wegschauen ' .	-2.7088
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-1.7954
Michael Hesemann : This is the great problem that the reporting mixed everything and has been mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere , in the middle of the time , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.2743
This is , however , an abuse of the report .	-2.2741
In fact , there is clean separation : between the pre-school and the gymnasium of the domestic paths , between sexual abuse and violence excesses and , let us say other accusations .	-4.1147
In addition , the report has been dealing with incidents from the time since 1945 , including four decades where Georg Ratzinger was not the chorus of the Domspatzen .	-3.7311
The whole terrible educational pedagogy , the cases in which banks of sadistic teachers have been harassed and maltreated , including appalling , all occurred at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions have been ruled .	-5.6407
But with those Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do when he got the boys first when they were already on the domestic gymnasium .	-3.9111
On that , as most of the witnesses stressed , the topic " preschool " was taboo .	-3.4081
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " states .	-2.6704
What was different from the domestic engymnasium ?	-2.6267
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but there was no sadistic violence .	-2.6130
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him in spite of violence ' .	-3.6940
At the most , there is a criticism of having looked away .	-5.0052
But , despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the conditions in pre-school .	-3.2648
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish himself and wanted to hear from the processes at a school where he was not effective and responsible ( so the witness ) , and then only again at 1993 .	-5.2256
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the states ?	-3.2285
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the domestic gymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-2.8492
He points out this out that ' the pre-school continues to practise the caning penalty ' .	-3.9928
In view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-2.5723
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed , when circulation penalties were long prohibited in Bavaria .      T          	-4.0682
Before that , they occurred in a legal grey area , as each of us well knows .	-3.1131
There was also difficult to assess him where the people concerned may have been exaggerated or dramatized , and where the admissible limit was really exceeded .	-4.2082
Nor can it be said that he had always looked a l .	-2.8822
That is simply not true .	-1.3356
Only in 1980 was the caning penalty of schools officially abolished in Bavaria .	-2.9239
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to the time .	-5.0904
How do you see that ?	-1.6508
Michael Hesemann : We are talking about the ' case-strick of anachronism ' , that is , the risk of evaluating past moral standards today .	-3.4765
The Prince is already right .	-2.0752
Of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was abhorrent at all times and not to what was broken in the pre-school of recurrences and violence in innocent child souls , which goes far beyond the usual ones .	-5.1037
That is all terrible and I am glad that it is finally recorded .	-2.5877
But at the same time I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.5980
His resources for disciplining and punishing , that is , ears and hairs and ears were widespread in the 1970s .	-3.5965
As physical punishment then has been prohibited , it has also kept itself strictly on  i thi .	-4.0163
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in talks with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-2.9439
Did the issue of caning penalty also raise ?	-3.9361
Michael Hesemann : Well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , since the Domspatzen played only a side role .	-4.1266
Nevertheless , I do not believe that he had a strict regime there .	-3.0810
But that must also be said : without this perfectionism , without the demand of unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible to form an institution of world ranking from the rather nationally known Regensburg Domspatzen , real European cultural ambassadors and its musical tradition , which went on tours twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-4.9900
With boilers and bonbons alone , one does not make any big singers and above all success in whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-4.8888
As what for a person did you experience Georg Ratzinger at the talks to their book ?	-4.0551
Michael Hesemann : By working on the book and beyond , I have really experienced Georg Ratzinger very well and again as wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deep and heart good people , who cannot imagine that he could only do something suffering from a fly .           I   h  h  had t  t  b .  T  '  I  a m  a  s s  .  ' I w	-7.8542
I regularly receive how many former domestic paths still visit him today , 23 years after his emeritation , regularly contact him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of her family .	-4.0552
So those who have not forgiven him to date that he was once strict to them are clearly in the minority .	-2.9782
Most domestic patterns are grateful today for having enriched their lives and brought them the world of music to    t            	-4.3339
And that he always knows a good , fatherly teacher - a strict father , which may be - but was also a lovely respect to which they still look up today and which they are just honouring them .	-4.4618
Please , once again , clearly : everything that he is accused of are educational methods that were on the agenda at that time .	-3.8822
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-1.7783
But it is highly unfair , a man just because it is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make the media scapegoat .	-2.4478
There is all too obvious intention behind it .	-3.2101
Because the report , which has just been published , discharges it .	-2.8952
Now the decency would be a 93-year-old man , who has acquired great merits and would probably not know the Regensburg Domspatzen without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps no one would finally know in peace .	-5.0350
