Stephen Miller , one of the key ideology of Trump ’ s regimes , were certainly what he symbolic act in a high-symbolic association with JCN 's proposals on the drastic immigration of legal immigration with legal immigration .	-5.6703
To continue to remain miller not to the status itself .	-2.6580
A northern of Bootsbers and Liberty Imitators would have learned him if he had done it .	-3.9030
But it is particularly important to his significance , and in particular the importance that has been described as the famous lazarus of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years of the decline of the thinking of its base .	-6.5815
When Miller Acosta recommended : ' I do not want to go towards a complete things about history , but the freedom of movement is .. a Symbol American freedom that experiences the world .	-4.7229
The idea that has been filled and not part of the original freedom status is " .	-13.1146
I am concerned that correct , but it is not true that story .	-4.7352
This is about the current Russian responsibility of Lazarus , which includes only a state of immigrants , but the worst of the poor : ' Deutsche Munich , who began to take advantage of themselves / free to take advantage of the description ' .	-8.7493
There was never a time when the ' elected department ' was on our screen .	-4.2978
Miller governments are not in literary criticism - made it clear that these people in Trump are not willing to s.	-3.8189
This conflict because of a statute is part of a broader political and cultural immigration : it is in fact a conflict about the importance of America .	-14.9442
Lazarus - and their friends who claim to place their words at the base - were very well aware that they fully complete a high political action .	-4.1979
The sculpture enjoyed the connection between defeated and American Republican Republicanism , by providing them in an absolute classical draft disorder .	-6.4654
Lazarus has changed this importance : In its point , the significant figure is no longer abstained - it has a voice .	-3.8888
And they have a very different name : Matter of exiles .	-2.6949
The connection of the picture with the image is a brief feminist Coup and a devastating attack on the American nativism .	-3.1902
And , like Lazarus , the importance of the status changed , the people of Lazarus wanted to return to a long time ago .	-3.4364
The big Schree Rush Limbaughter , a kind of Trump ’ s job for the Community , argued 2010 that the freedom status was invited to take into account , but rather a former Neo-conservative , which is the American flame in the night world : ' Lady Liberty .	-7.8559
They certainly contribute to the freedom of the United States in the rest of the world .	-1.7048
The package certainly not explained the way in the United States ' .	-8.6165
Although Limbaughter is a limitation of here .	-4.8404
The importance of statute is quite clear and even a question of the position of the truth .	-2.2861
The large phantailor Tat Lazarus stands on how to see how they delay , but hopeful people have long and often been taken to the deck of ships .	-7.5344
The world is true in the world to see people from the perspective of people who try to improve their lives .	-3.8516
Your status promise to them the words of hope and the window they must listen .	-2.9343
And that , of course , is not the perspective that milk and Trump would like to recognize .	-2.7673
Their package don 't want to explain the way , but the hatre that is the only source of power .	-4.3981

This brings me to Maryland to Gouvernor Larry Hogann to work more like Washington .	-3.4834
Hogan ’ s contributions have been blocked at least 45 presidential persons and have left their opinion on its official Facebook page .	-4.3212
And the American Civilian Liberties Union clearly asked him from this week .	-2.7022
The stability of the Guovernor understood the clarity as a friend , and the online commentary was fully aware of a ' Na , and ' ? ' .	-5.1147
" It is just Facebook " , that many people .	-1.4605
But it is important .	-0.3153
And it is particularly important if there is a type like Hogane .	-1.5078
This is a republican governor in an overwhelming democratic state which is unpopular .	-2.9627
He has the two-increase in accordance with President Gouvernor 's nation .	-3.7028
Hogan is not a reactionary heat of fit .	-3.5745
He showed a first hand in leading his state and strict entertainment of the principles .	-2.9141
He was also very painful to use Facebook as a primary resource to bink its electorates and play his harmonious cophotherapy on his side .	-5.2141
Therefore , the blocking of people who are paying on the side of governors - which is an public forum which is seen as official and working with public tax dollars - unnecessary and finally dangerous .	-4.9454
In an interview with the Waste Poast Hogans defended Hostels Sperre in Amelia Chassee the actions of the Gouvernors and argued that the blocking of comments continues to be a modernization .	-6.5862
But it is simply too easy to use the picture of drugs or hammer taxes that have online the page shown .	-5.3571
The post was blocked with some of the real people who were blocked by Hoggani .	-3.0593

" The biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist " , " write Valdez in his numerous violence on violence in this context .	-3.7586
His error is recommended - a large photo of Valdez , which shows how the word " Justice " , depends on the Riodoc building in the three years , Aarbra and Mirirabam Rami , Trans-Shirts , which shows his own sympathy or his panorama .	-8.7988
The workshop ranks less than two months after his took , and the reporters discussed over their shared issues , the Trarma , their alpine , their alpine , Slovenia , Paranoia .	-4.6184

But on the issue of Valdez there is nothing more practical than Switzerland .	-2.3204
Since Guzmans , arresting in the last year and the proliferation in the United States in January , Sinaloa was one of the bloody ’ s losses of the country , since rival groups have been struggling to fight the vacuum .	-5.9533
It does not make it possible that in Salinoa every day or several people will be spent on the streets or that peace of Friedhof is fully perceived , second majority for drugs that are many homes for life .	-6.1376

Despite the fact that Valdez was aware of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 6 ) , a green and director of Riodocce , with the school that he had been protected by his fand not .	-4.9339
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-0.9983
First of all , it was in February the publication of an interview with damage loop , a leader of the rivalised career groups in war with Guzmans .	-4.2854
This publication may have reinforced the solution , denied Gangmize members of every expenditure on the expenditure , as soon as they were exposed to timetable .	-6.4321
The second mistake to force Valez did not force to make a different story published by the country to leave its own security .	-3.9361
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and in exchange , and his death as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.4911
He had assumed so long that his friends and colleagues would always be that he would always be .	-2.6717
He was careful in 2003 as an experienced reporter for North After his five colleagues to Riodoce this concluded and President US dollars .	-5.3875
In Sinaloa , it was impossible to pursue journalism without introducing the raw engineering problem ' , this Bojorquez .	-4.0225
The time deserves a reputation for the multiple and multiple rapporteur , and the environment and adopting action .	-4.0979
Reporters have been published , without publishing public sector , and the lesson were found by a publication in which they read up history , which no one had negotiated .	-6.4365
Annight years of the Riodocce allows the " Maria-Cabot Cabot-Prize " for its rapporteur in Latin America .	-4.6794
In the same year , Valdez can protect the ' International Press Freedom Award ' of Journalists ' to protect journalists for his courage in the consection of the Mexican drugs , wherever she carried out .	-4.9256
He was difficult to ensure that he had got fear .	-3.0233

There were the returning of the former Boxers Julio Chavez in Salinoa .	-3.4001
You had also chosen to the government ’ s status expenditure , which was concentrated on the home of the government .	-4.7645
And it was a group that found in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block of the office of the State ’ s state administration .	-3.1738
There is no official word about how to describe or how it was , before it was possible to write what everyone knows : the restaurant is a lobal left of drugs and authorities .	-4.8587
A reporter from public experience shows that the restaurant was registered by a political leader , the government ’ s government institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which was almost the century demonstrated by all the political level .	-5.4940
Recently , several PRI-Gouvernors were condemned for high-carbon cases of corruption .	-4.3836

The office of Valdez has been protested for drags and authors who protested against journalists , because they are something that they are never expected : activists in the name of the press .	-5.1414

As regards the agency in Regenburg , nobody knows that it should be ' damaging and decisive data that should be punished in the future and in future ; but despite the " Gramadial manipulation " , " the authoria Sarcafaria , Horika and members of the national members of the Italian Bioettek.	-8.5364
" The individual to start the Catholic church as a source of all over , is part of the Agriculture experience and the public opinion on which normally keeps scaria .	-5.1134
For tourists in Gloria and Taxis , too , in the interview with the Bavarian Round : " Man goes on the church and this is a friendly friends ' .	-4.9702
Furthermore , it indicates that , in their youth , a very last number of damaging ' , ' in order to children , I think that I was sent to be sent ' .	-6.7132
They are doing unfair to apply today 's extensive decades , because the world changes themselves .	-3.2569
In this context , the reports on about the abuse of abuse are also powerful , also powerful passport of the Georgia Council .	-5.0368
Viger rightly , author and Historiker Michael Hesmann , who was translated into the Council 's experience and " my breast of the Pope " ( in 12 languages ) .	-4.6972
" I have to take Georgia into protection " , this Healmann " , because everyone had nothing to do with him " he can make the events of the conclusion .	-4.9255
What exactly is the 40-sided report which presented by the Biston Regenburg Forum to include this administration of law ?	-4.5020
With this in mind 547 Resource Dompatzes , the beginning of 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s ' high plausibility ' victims ' victims of transfer , 67 domain sexual data were .	-6.8923
In conclusion , the Council concludes Georgia Council , which was confirmed by 1964 to 1994 : ' this collection is therefore sustained that the domestic sphere was subject to many forms of physical and psychological violence .	-6.6740
Precisely in high emotionality , the power for students could well be happy to help .	-15.1319
Nevertheless , in contrast to numerous other debts , that many victims protect the general humanity and therefore break in many cases , despite violence even positive connections with him ' .	-4.6942
In the interview , Hesmann explains the conclusion of the abuse of candidate domestic documents in the Regenburg Domas Georgia for its opin.	-5.4700
Mr Hesemann , the 40-page report on the " administration of violence exchange in protection agencies " reflects a special image of domestic increase in Georgia " .	-6.1078
In the one hand , many children see his " humanity " .	-4.4245
On the other hand it seems to be as cholerian and perfection that the oil treatment has also been demonstrated if a domestic increase is not a top performance .	-6.8233
How do you like his biograph report ?	-1.5483
Michael Hesmann : if you look forward to the most 4 president report by the presidency , you have to ask himself why the name Georgia Council is moving forward .	-5.8660
In the meantime , it is significantly behind him , and it is clear from every consumption of the Middle East or corresponding to sexual abuse .	-7.5603
Also , the violence excesses on the pre-school sector are also outside its effects .	-4.1627
One can certainly be experienced by this , or by the first significant comments .	-5.8858
The domestic doctor name , on which he became practical , was practically punished as ' solution ' , ' Hotel " and " better world " .	-16.6317
Thus , the broad majority of his keyword Georgia is a very excellent centre , described as " warmly " , " published " , " warmly " , " competent " , " and " competent " , who had extremely good lessons , the young people , corresponding and " consolidated " of children " were " well .	-8.0576
At long last a minority , over its perfectionism and his high emotionality , which has already led to well .	-5.0539
It was not only with students and key sought and the key software , but also victims , but also to participate in the Haraza or October , he has already decided to debt and decide for themselves .	-8.2979
However , in its honour of representation , it must be provided that such relationships were described in the question , the 1960s and 1970 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , were probably spread with parents such as teachers .	-7.0158
Can you find these inclusive methods ?	-1.9720
Of course , I think everyone can be born in 1968 .	-2.6425
I also experienced the final school , a state government school .	-3.1252
According to what is actually the report , namely the legislative abuse of sexual abuse and violence excesses on the proposals , which are free batgas .	-5.0244
What is already asking for his commitment and its role as a breakdown of XVI to do is whether many media would be happy to him .	-6.0592
In the Bayern Pope , yes who have never understood it , are always . are always to work ! are ! ! ! ! are ! ! are !	-13.3993
However , the report is far from Georg Council in any respect .	-3.2740
In the media this report , which has been reported very much about the subject of misuse in the Regenburg Domas report .	-4.6341
Will Georgia Ratziger report also be developed in conclusion or scientific vote in terms of sexual abuse to the lo?	-3.8952
Michael Healmann : Guanz .	-10.5614
None of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claimed to have confident the domain capital .	-4.1123
Not even the elders were adopted .	-1.3001
" I have never trust to speak to my father or my courage about this " , which was a commitment to the other " elsewhere , " I was all aware of that . "	-5.8934
The true problem in reconciliation of sexual abuse was and , though , is that most victims are victims .	-3.7316
If they did not even confidence elders and speed , then they failed to a chorter that would be prepared to some extent colleagues .	-5.7043
How does the document below ratings role in terms of abuse ?	-3.5958
Michael Hesmann : A father rate had been demanding : " Despite sexual abuse ... I see ... no case where Georg Ratinger had justified ( Georg Ratziniger ) and could reserve any half of the second half .	-9.3007
I consider it ... also appearing in addition to the newspaper showed him ... for example , for example , in cases , clor more opened than open to par, international trust , conlilele, lic, c, etc .	-10.4989
That is what you can talk about Sex ... '	-10.3098
The report comes from the very clear start : ' Dass will not confirm himself in the previous school and / or its environment , within the framework of the investigation ' .	-4.2788
What is sexual abuse is affecting Georgia ’ s Council ratings therefore to speak free .	-4.8049
It is not possible to prevent him or cannot prevent it from going to anything . can also be , howev, can , will not to su, , can , eit, can	-13.7601
That is why we do not have a reason to bring its good names with the current crimes in connection with regard to how they have in some cases .	-4.8673
In the media , much of " violence texts " was to read in the regenburg documents .	-3.3629
The initial document made Georgia Council is prevented in the report ' Wegau ' .	-4.3144
Can he live with this ?	-2.8387
Michael Hesmann : this is the great problem that , in the rapporteur , everything has been devoted to a peaceful misuse of sexual abuse and violence excesses , and so on , I urge Georgia , Georgia .	-5.4140
But that is precisely a abuse of the report .	-2.0631
As a result , this between the proposals and the gymnasium of domestic documents , between sexual abuse and violence excesses , and this is once again a few of us .	-4.8015
Furthermore , the report deals with precedence from the time since 1945 , including four decades , in which Georgia was not the Chamber of Dompatzer 's documents .	-4.9363
The whole specific representative dagogy , which were selected by these teachers of teachers and magazined , and subsequently designed to apply everything in terms of torture and phenomena where truly scandalous populations were kept into access .	-24.2862
But with those who had nothing to do with the Council ’ s younger , because he had nothing to do with young people when they were already on the document name .	-6.1330
At the same time , as most of these days , the issue ' pre-school ' was .	-3.2137
It was only lucky to come and get so much better treatment and many of ' paradish ' accessions .	-5.3063
What was different to the documentation synthesis ?	-2.6191
Michael Hesmann : Da ruled round was disciplined , but not a different violence .	-4.3839
This also applies Georg Council 's report to conclude that many victims protect the general humanity and therefore in many cases , despite violence , even positive connections with him ' .	-4.4267
At the same time , the highest findings have to look forward .	-3.3564
But despite all efforts , the report could only derate two times which were reported by the pre-accession debt .	-3.6832
The first time in 1971 / 71 when he had just come to an excessive debt , who had not been really responsible and answered ( the time ) , and then only with regard to 1993 .	-6.5845
Concluding Georgia Council in access to consistency ?	-3.9333
Michael Hesmann : No , since 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the documentation cynamic , which reproduces even reproduction .	-4.3998
As a result , he said , ' in addition to ' the previous school means that the auditors are ratified ' .	-14.8014
As for the danger of negative press publishes , it is urgent for the threat of negative press .	-5.0525
That was , of course , a time when legal clarity was started , as a rule of law were banned in Bayers .	-5.2820
They are themselves in a legal area , as everyone kof us .	-3.3973
Since it was difficult to estimate where affected affects perhaps or dramatisized , and where really was the real border .	-4.3441
But we cannot always have hardly been made for this , but he had al. could shown shshshof whshshshshin the of sh	-12.5395
That is simply not true .	-0.9896
Only in 198 , the early schools were punished in Bayers officially .	-3.2143
For Gloria from Thurexis and Taxis , it is unfair to apply today ’ s pdagogical measures to apply time .	-4.6980
How do you see this ?	-1.1264
Michael Hesmann : still historians decide from the " Fall of the Anchronism " , the danger of assessing the risk of competing today ’ s moral major.	-6.1475
That has already been right about .	-1.8852
But that does not , of course , appear to sexual abuse that has been described at all times , and not for what was doing in the previous contradictions and violence of innocent children , which has already been demonstrated on the substantial economy .	-6.5306
That is all quite painful and I am glad that it is finally built up .	-3.3314
At the same time , I have to take Georg Council 's protection , because everyone had nothing to do with him .	-2.4924
His funds to discipline and contribution , therefore , to the hard and phrase , were widespread in the 1970s .	-3.4904
As long as physical punishment has been banned , he also followed itself too .	-4.4296
What images of his Regenburg Georgia have been able to repeat your discussions with the " my breakfast ?	-5.9094
Can the subject of the subject of spring ?	-3.0577
Michael Hesmann : Now , in the book , there is the life of its brutal Joseph , so Pope Business XVI , experienced from his perspective , since the documents only were a life .	-6.7998
Nevertheless , I do not despite the fact that he took a strict regime . does not , remain , , does is , , rem, do, I , ,	-8.5017
But we must also consider this : without the introduction of uniform discipline , it would be likely to prevent the unique discipline , although it would be hardly possible to address national recognition of general documents without calling for the world ’ s cultural banning and its Socialist tradition , which , at the same time , two of the US ( 1983 and 19898 ) and 1989 ( and 1989 ) .	-9.0910
Kessen and Bonn alone makes no large success in terms of discipline , survival and self-designed consequences , while at the same time , discipline , survival and self-development .	-7.1445
When what a people did Georg Council speak in talks about their book ?	-4.6222
Michael Hesmann : Thursday the work on the book and the Community , I have drawn up George Council really very well and recognized as a wonderful , horriful , fundamental , good and dedicated people who might not make sure that it might do something . can make it posthings to do .	-20.2644
I am pleased with how many former domains are finding today 23 years of its own emphasis , regularly contact , he visited him - is almost likely to negotiate - and how a member of their family is . whliin cof . re, of of are of of whwhare of wh	-16.2388
Those who cannot help him until today ’ s once he was today 's strict , are so clear in the minority .	-4.8084
The majority of most doctors are grateful to thank him for their lives and the world ’ s Music can accept them .	-5.2333
And that always a good , terrible teachers - a strict father , which may be - but it was also a major respect to which they are finding and that they look forward to them today .	-6.0886
And once again , we feel very clear : what we were on the agenda for him , we have an experience methods which were on the agenda .	-6.4160
Nevertheless , the fact that we have transferred these times before we w.	-3.8114
But it is increasingly unjustified only because it is prominent and has a perfect breakdown to make the medial southern back .	-4.4062
Since the obvious intention is to be obviously obvious only .	-12.9752
The report , which was published , was published .	-1.6361
Now that the Anstad can offer a 93-year man who has lived great services and without the Bayerns and perhaps Germany would never leave the real documents in peace .	-6.0502
