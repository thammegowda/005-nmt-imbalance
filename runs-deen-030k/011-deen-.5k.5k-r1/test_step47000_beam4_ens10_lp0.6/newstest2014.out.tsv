We will argue that an independent Scotland needs to be provided with the Schengen area as a condition for EU members .	-2.9549
This supplies the safety borders for history on passing controls in mountains and a city rate with secure borders .	-5.7042
Indeed , in the Strathy ’ s proposal for the possible economic advantages that would be more freedom of expression in Europe , but , for example , example – would not play a role in the short term .	-6.6053
Nobody has also mentioned that the EU Member States are often providing their strict rules if it is for them to come out .	-4.4790
Since Scotland does not stop at the Schengen area , the required non-commitment to Brussels would only be a small access to what really wanted to the Scott .	-4.7088

We will probably be soon why the Swanz is probably living in the other direction .	-17.1813
Professor Vallortigara has shown this : “ still have the hundreds of films with hundreds – either a natural version or a philosophy to eliminate other aspects , and we could therefore carry out the movement of the black or legal tax . ”	-5.8508
