Since Guzmann ’ s imprisonment in the last year and the delivery of the United States in January , Sinalina had become one of the most bloody battlefield of the country because rival groups have been fought here to meet the vacuum .	-5.0082
It does not make sense that in Sinalina every day or several people are on the road , or that peace is fully meaningful , secondary machine for drugs who are bigger than many homes for living .	-6.1080
Remember that there is a stage in the United States when only a cartel control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .	-3.0752
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorzez ( 60 ) , a welcome and Director of Riodo , with the debt it was unable to protect his friend and not protect his friend .	-4.2747
He believed that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.4162

This publication may have increased the sons , gallered members of the selection of each executive scheme if they had to deliver a timetable .	-6.8849

" You have to take the task that you as journalists - either do or play the documents .	-3.8455
I do not want to say : ' What did you take so many deaths ... why you did not say what went before ? '	-4.2373
The Riododo-team was missing Valdez , the Spain voice which has been able to floor as a port employer , friends and , which was generally linked with poverty and rating , a lesson who survived .	-8.0830
They trust in his routine .	-1.2280

He would always be to El Guayabo , the bar against the office , and there are always the same Church .	-2.9570
Would they ask : War to be their love to the routine ?	-4.3307
His death has also forced to question their own opinions about how they can get their work best and be able to keep lives .	-4.4036

It was found from Shawn Funk when he was found on 21 March 2011 in the Sunoctor Millenium mini close to the North Mcray of Alberta , Canada .	-4.7663

" If you don 't think that it is almost believed that the Caleb brown , scientists in the Royal Tyrre Museum where the creature is born .	-5.7595
" It will be incorporated in scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best reserved dinosis execution plan - the mona Lisa of Dinosanieries . "	-4.9868
Researchers revealed that this plant is likely to be threatened , even though it is covered with a disarmament , and a related record of meat , probably threatened by meat exporting dino.	-7.6963
The strong dinouser used a rock and a white day before breaking , and used a spirit technology that is known as recreational animals , which is also used by many in modern an.	-6.7102
It would have liked to have better to interfere in its environment and explain its enemies , which indicates that it is threatened by greater dinosis .	-4.2905
The 110 million old creature from the family of Nodosauer ’ s family has made a first glass in May , and now in Royal Tyrre Museum of Palaontology .	-4.8474
Research now has the desire to study the animal title and it realised Boreal-Markelli , following the Museum techniques Mark Museum , a team which has dealt with more than 7,000 hours in order to carthis .	-14.3602
The restaurant maintaining the exercise allows you to document the village and an international team of scientists , the patterns and the museums of sheps and arms across its body .	-5.4311
They discovered the convergence , a widespread defense method in animal , which means that the seat of creature was the seat of the creature rather than their page .	-5.5269
Although convergence is usual , the results are surprised , as the size of Borealopia ’ s size is much increasing today ’ s living animals .	-5.3357
It indicates that the Dinosajourne of sufficient pressure has been aged by meat exposure dinosis that the Evolution reached the suffering of confrontation as a means of the survival .	-6.5109
But most of the temporary genetic animals embracing the conversion - remember you of Respect , Zebras , or Güteltendentials - are much minor evidence of what signals that this Nodosa was put into a real battle .	-8.9772
" Stark Raubon-behavior behavior on a massive , powerful dinostics show how dangerous the dinouser has been the circumstances of the circumstances must be ' , Brown .	-7.0097
The chemical analysis of organic connections in their scale also shows that the skin of dinosis was needed .	-3.8109
Scientists continue to investigate the animals on his lives , including his conservated warming to find out what it has been the last time to do .	-5.9088
They believe that the Dinossor , when he went down a flight and into the sea , where he was left behind the back to the sea .	-5.2639
This time Alberta was as southern as the South Florida today , and Forms and Oceans probably much further than they are today .	-5.3501
" This Nodosaurer is really noticed because it is fully covered with conservated skin , but also in three dimensions , and maintained the original form of the animal form , said browser .	-4.7146
" The outcome is that the animals will almost be like in early morning .	-3.1936

The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he was founded on 21 March 2011 in the Sunoctor Millennium minutes close to the North Kanada , Canada .	-4.9867
According to the Museum , it is the world ’ s best restored dinouseums in the world , including Haus and River , is completely distinguished from the shoes to the hil.	-7.1523
The creatures were in the average of about 18 foot ( 5 meters ) long and have lost until 3,000 pounds ( 1.300 km ) .	-3.5422

To use , however , certain conditions must be met . You need a shop or tablet .	-4.8663
And we need to set an online ticket - which already has most of the passengers .	-3.6120
It must also buy the Apple of the Bahn , the DB Navigator , which is the most appropriate type of ticket book .	-5.3404
At last , there is a session reservation reservation .	-1.9374
For the " comfort Check-in " functioning , " One rises in the sugar , runs its card under my tickets ' .	-6.1211
In the tests , a button seems to be used to electronic analyse .	-3.0349
The accommodation owes to their mobile devices , a selection that driving biggest X is in the beginning and taken to the last seat of Y .	-7.0610
Comment of the accompanied with the card control at Platz shows that there is a passenger with already valued online ticket .	-5.6210
You can therefore continue to work further , silence .	-3.3045
" The check-in " has two advantages : one for the customers aimed at use the beach - in turn to use the passenger .	-3.8578
" Those who prefer to travel without ticket control through our accommodation , simply covers in the DB Navgator .	-5.6070

The fact is that it is often a case , but not one of the staff who is required for assessment of online tickets .	-5.9833
either the credit card or individual welds or any other document that must be made .	-4.2244
The consequences are final discussions between accompanied and vehicle , which leads to bad voting in the detail or big and delay in monitoring the control of its own tickets and the sheets at the end of the time to other concerns .	-6.4859
Only small number of tests can benefit the new service .	-2.7034

But the death was no new for them and their community .	-1.5607
They set their hands to return to the evening at the Tweether at the Canadian Drive .	-5.5848
There have been photos from the police band and people who claimed that browser father who claimed to be a film with the written : ' Fergusons police has just killed my armed son ! '	-7.0165
They observed a Live Feed , where a police was a group of demonstrators with a bloody story .	-4.6331
In a other video , she said , uncertainly another police list and wrote : " I will you need all kinds of animals . "	-5.2922
" This is not common " , " Ferrel reminds her statement .	-3.4497
" This is not the kind of morning we have wanted and we can call typically . "	-3.8524

After graduation at 23 , she had their 6-year-old deaths from the House of their father and decided that the two morning would take the next morning to Fer.	-5.5292
What happened in the following three years with Ferrel and Ferguson , is the subject of a new documentary film , ' Whost Street ' , in the children from 11 .	-4.1430
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the perspective of the people who live in the Community and have the streets to ask answers .	-20.2968
When Ferrel , with their goods , who spoke a blood cloning and an adapting chront , spoke after Ferguson , the two discussions that she went off this morning " about the black experience and the pocket bedroom « .	-9.5469
'Do you remember how I have to tell you when the black people have to fight them , what she said ? '	-5.2940
" We are going to go to fuel because the police has made a 18-year-year young and that was not correct .	-3.7204
I was not able to take them ' , Ferrel later , later .	-2.6051
" What happens today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.5892
It must be knowledged and see . that are and we we want and in and he that , he	-8.8679
It must be developed , not only activist and organization , but also the various stories of experience and the hard constitution , and what we need to do to be free to free ourselves .	-4.5341
Even though I happened to give an experience in which they live personally no cozier racism , it is not different to the next black women ’ s children .	-6.3646
I have the feeling that I would demonstrate her bad service to deliver them . '	-4.3156
The first stage when they came in Feruson , was awaited at the South Florensant Road , a place on the police authorities , who had become a Campterritory where the activists were waiting for the potential non-clause of Officer Darfur Wilson .	-8.0426
There are also the Ferrel and its daughters with local business holders who took place on the agenda .	-6.9228
They are preparing days before and helping them to pass on demonstrations .	-2.7900
Slowly , a new type of activism for Ferrerol has begun .	-4.1937
" My activism after the 9 August August ' , she said that she was a study at the University of Missouri St , Louis of the priority study Nurews Association and was based on Escience and health inequalities in harmony .	-7.1237
" I had no experience in the organization .	-1.3052
It has all been done . '	-10.4713
See weeks later , Ferrel went on to a protest demonstration of Sabah Kolayan , one of the Co-register of Films .	-6.0715
Kayan said , she and her cameras Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted ' what happened .	-4.3027
A question was arisen in the sense : ' Well it documented or trying to find an history that you can use ? '	-4.0428
This skepticism has been threatened by incorrect cases of people , often of white - in a community benefited from its pain and their resistance .	-4.1320
As Mr Kayan recently said in an interview : ' We have heard that people who are born and forced to win their votes and we wanted to see others ' .	-5.6382
Kayan had already worked with the then Coss-Representer David David David , a artist from the area of its activism in which he was aware of death pen.	-7.2067
His engagement brought the project closer , together with six other interventions , was the team of ' Whoris Street ' in recent years after Brown 's extension .	-5.5127
" This documentary film is not someone that speaks for us or speaking with us . " We say Dav. , as , I .	-6.0837
" This was the main cause for me how these people are being presented , because I will be called ' .	-3.2437
The objective was not to concentrate on Ferrel experience - to show that it is not a messa-driving leader , but also a community that has been collapsed as the open parts in film .	-6.0733
As a result , the documents of ' Whone Street ' are overwhelmingly personal aspects of Ferrel lives , how they lose and their wife .	-5.1924
" I felt like nature " , Ferrel and laid , when she met the product for the first time .	-4.1827
" But I understood that there must be some injuries in this work and in the breakdown of black people . "	-3.0882
Furthermore , Ferrerol History repeatedly reflects the role of poor women in the broader Black Live movement .	-3.2604
Two of the three reasons of movement following the black teenagers of Martin in 2012 , the film of Blaclivelivelians ' in social media has been identified as difficult .	-6.5143
" Black , bloody women in leadership have made the movement a whole " , said Ferrel , " and therefore we are fighting to various fronts .	-4.5050
Short , school women must bear the main burden of all . '	-4.0175
Improved to say that ' the movement of poor women is determined by poor women and many poor women ' .	-2.7935
It is , however , that ' this is not an affirmative type of action ' , which has been selected because of their identity as a result of the film .	-4.4318
" He was the person who had stirred this energy disrupted ' .	-4.4725
" It is not a coincidence , even though it was the first front front because it was a poor , woman , Mrs so much at stake .	-4.9962
You can feel like their energy through the screen . "	-2.4155
There is now a devastating camera in Fergone , but racic links between the community and the police have remained .	-5.9804
Ferrel is on round of 2 <unk> years because of the block of a car protocol in a demonstration .	-4.1181
She describes the social atmosphere of the area they call their homes : " A chaos " .	-3.0705
Nevertheless , it came to a general and feeling that they feel committed to the streets that she was three years ago .	-4.1207
" It is our duty to combat our freedom .	-1.0297

While advocating more clients in the city , it is worth trying to benefit from the rest of business , fear the opponents that the football zone is bulging .	-7.0970

Above all , where are the farm market hell during the construction period ?	-3.7969
The old Edeka would be a solution - also if the Bit-Galery Galery is certainly true .	-4.0318

George Market : " This is simply not working .	-2.9695

I believe it would have been better to promote a proper construction market , rather than promoting this gallery .	-8.9806

In connection with the reports concerning the abuse of waste , it is often poorly a paper of George ratings .	-4.6363

In the final report , the George rate that was active in Regulation 1964 : ' summary , in fact , adherence to the fact that , from Dompaller R. in many cases , physical and physical violence have been applied by physical and physical violence .	-6.9534
In particular , in the high emotionality , the punishment for shoes could fall even more deeply .	-5.5964

Mr Hesemann , the 40-Site report on the ' incidents of violence against defence floods on the regulatory floods ' there is a contradictory picture of domestic capital George .	-6.2048
On the one hand , many students ' humanity ' .	-2.6416
On the other hand , he also appears as a Cholerier and Perfect Perfect who drew up oil when a domestic performance was not a top-performance .	-6.1173
How will you be a biograph on this final report ?	-2.2819
Michael Hesemann : if you look at the mothers and love the whole 40 pages for a long time ago , we do need to ask themselves more quickly , why the name of George Council is at all .	-6.4131
Him has just been inserted , and he is becoming clear from any person who is preferred to discover in the appalling cases of sexual abuse .	-6.2438
The text of violence at the regulatory text occurs outside his impact .	-4.1967
He can , if he prefer , for his later or first claims have not been taken seriously .	-4.8550
The domain cymmentary , on which he has been effective , was inspired by all questions - " Resolution " , " Him , " and better world " .	-7.0667
In this regard , the broad majority of his students George Ratiger describes an excellent testing , describes it as " warmly " , " weight " , " incompetent " and " understandable " when extremely good teachers that took place on junction with cuisine , cuisine and bonnes ' .	-9.1338
Only one minority is applied to its perfectionism and its high sensitivity that , too , led to arms .	-15.5379
He is not only with students and the key role to the ground , but also to celebrate your feelings of June or Ohrize , he has already been deeply regretted and accused to it .	-8.2871
However , to his honourable reservation , the need to be said that such an integration methods were widespread in the 1960s and 1970 ’ s , in parents such as teachers . and , , , , , as teachers .	-6.9725
Are you like this inconsistency methods ?	-3.2400
Of course , I think everyone of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.1506
I also experienced this in a global school , a state-owned gymnasm , .	-3.2671
Contrary to what is actually in this report , namely the relevant sexual abuse and the violence of text on the proposals , are free of baths .	-4.9163
Since we are already asking whether it is not likely to do with his recognition and role as Bruins XVI. , as a brush of Beine XVI.	-7.0395
On Bayeran Papest , many who have never understood him , are still satisfactory .	-3.8815
The truth is , however , that the report lates George rate rate in any regard .	-3.8371
In the media , the report has been considered a great deal of misuse in the Regulators Dompatch .	-4.2253
Will George Council President-in-Office report also produce any degree of use or consistency in terms of sexual abuse on the burden ?	-4.1359
Michael Hesemanne : whole is clearly never in .	-2.9107
None of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claim to have the phenomenon trust .	-3.1544
Not even the parents were used .	-2.2255
" I have never spoken to talk about my father or my mother about ' , a involved in others was a caught for the others , ' it was all a great deal ' .	-12.8515
The real problem with the statement of sexual abuse was and it is that most of the victims are weak .	-3.6173
If they are not even trust in parents and gender stereotyles , then certainly not a chorter , but a colleague would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrators .	-5.7785
How do the Domatz-Schüller President-in-Office play a role in terms of abuse ?	-4.3677
Michael Hesemann : A fragile study formulated this : ' Do not think of sexual abuse ... I see no case in the computer ( George ratings ) legal findings , and could have stopped each property .	-7.0946
I feel that it is also truly absurd to accept that , as well as being open up the business or even more clarified , than opening up their parents , internationals , trust teachers , etc .	-7.8464
I am thinking that he talks about sex message ... - undas . as much as as it as as as as as as as as as	-7.9253
This is what the report is all about the very clear result : ' The failure to confirm him in the run-up to the student and / or their environment is not confirmed under the framework of investigation ' .	-6.0426
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , George rate is therefore free to speak from any consciousness .	-2.8082
This is not the case that it can be expected to prevent or demonstrate it .	-4.1257
So there is no reason to put its good names with these current crimes into connection with which unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.8120
In the media , much of ' violence texts ' was read in regulatory phenomenon .	-3.8615
The earlier domestic capital of George ratings ' report is currently drawn up in the report .	-3.9073
Mugabe , because he will live with this draft ?	-2.6151
Michael Hesemann : This is indeed the great problem that in the rapporteur attempts to miss everything and was met to a huge sexual abuse and violence and anywhere , in the middle of Georgia .	-5.2372
But this is , in turn , a abuse of the report .	-1.6049
As we know , there is a sexual abuse and the gymnaste of the phenomenon , between sexual abuse and violence , and once again , that we would prefer otherwise take other . of this kun, we as well as te.	-9.7128
Moreover , the report is drafting an event from the 1945 , so it was four decades which George ratings had not been Chompathletes of the dom. this , un, and in un, the was unforunfortun.	-16.4740
The whole horrific text pagogically , cases where claims of the Asian teachers have been regulated and mally displayed and related to nationally displayed , have all been touched on the regulatory hs and pigs where genuine substances have had to be consistent .	-11.2669
But with those who had nothing to do with domestic ratings , because he revealed the Jews when they were already on the phenomenon of the patent cynamism .	-6.4686
On the one hand , the most outstanding zones , the issue of ' pre-school ' .	-5.2473
It was only happy to welcome her , and the so much better treatment and for many " paradise " .	-4.9472
What was it different to the domestic temperature gymnasty ?	-4.2488
Michael Hesemann : As there were already disciplinary , but not a salute violence .	-4.8166
And this is also true of George Council President-in-Office , which concludes the report concludes that many victims estimate the general humanity of nuclear and therefore , despite many cases , violence even positive reminds him .	-5.6172
That is what remains high , at least the draft , to do .	-4.3681
However , despite all efforts , the report was defined only two timetable which it has been reported by the understanding of the proposals .	-4.0250
The first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish a school which he was not effective and responsible ( the teens ) , and then not until 1993 .	-4.8638
Doing George Council warned from the understanding of consistent ?	-5.1882
Michael Hesemann : Nin 1989 , he reproduced a letter to the director of domestic patentynamism that even reproduces the report .	-3.8598
There is no doubt that " in the school that the proposals will continue to be practiced ' .	-5.2127
Even given the danger of negative press publications , he chosen more urgent .	-3.6512
That was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was prohibited when testers were banned in Bavaria .	-3.3540
Then before they occurred in a legal grey area , like everyone knows us .	-4.4456
This was also hard to estimate him , where the people perhaps override or dramatized , and where the reliable border has been surprised .	-5.3458
One cannot , however , say that he had always been doing weight .	-3.5993
That is simply not true .	-0.3430
Only in 1980 , the testing on schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.1469
Fifth Gloria from Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today 's pagogical machines to the day .	-4.6343
What do you see this ?	-1.2893
Michael Hesemann : We talk of historians talking about the ' case of Andruk ' , so that the danger to assess past today ’ s moral masses .	-13.6246
There is already the leaders in this regard .	-2.7920
But of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was overwhelming at all times , and not for what has been brought to the populations of resistance and violence in innocent child sexes , which has already been far beyond the way forward .	-9.9022
That is all this is an appalling and I am glad that it will finally be worked .	-3.2712
At the same time , I must assume George President-in-Office , because all that had nothing to do with him .	-2.8146
Its resources to discipline and pute , therefore , doubt and hacks were widespread in the 1970 ’ s .	-5.0234
As a physical punishment , he has also banned strictly .	-3.6491
What picture of his regulators has ratings in George ratings for speeches with you the book of my " My B" ?	-12.6867
Can the subject of testing also be saved for language ?	-4.0917
Michael Hesemann : Well , the life of his Bruders Joseph , Papest Bendtnen XI. , is one of its prospects , as the domestic temperatures are just a net route .	-6.3634
Nevertheless , I do not disappear that there was a strict registration there .	-3.8074
But this must also be said , without the call for this perfectionism , without the demands of unconditional discipline , it would have been hardly possible to be possible to reform , from which he was aware of national regulatory temperatures a global institution of global cultural backgrounds , cultural and musical tradition , which , in the second time ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan .	-10.6989
With Keken and Bonnes alone , we are now talking about not even a great scale and success in each area , but always discipline , reading and self-handling .	-7.9723
What people have you experienced George ratings for their book ?	-3.5337
Michael Hesemann : During the work on the book and further , I have learned George Council very well and again learned as a wonderful , humane , deeper , deepening and coupled people who cannot prefer to do something about a lot .	-7.8320
I commend regularly with how many former domains still are today , 23 years after his legitimate , regular contact him , to visit him - he is almost unfair - and how a member of their family .	-6.7495
Those who did not give him the impression that he was once again strictly involved , are clearly in the minority .	-4.4290
Most domains are grateful to him today that he has brought their lives and brought music to the world of Music .	-3.7584
And he would always be a good , father , a strict father , certainly a feeling - but a feeling that was a viable respect for which they still look at today and who are proud to be dead .	-7.9978
I would ask you very clearly that all of what he prefers to do , are enhancement methods that were then on the agenda .	-5.2962
We can be glad to have overcome this time .	-1.3414
But it is high unjustified to make a man , just because it is a minimum breakdown , has become a medial scape .	-5.2142
Since the bad intention is to be hindered , it is only obvious .	-3.7345
The report which has just been published , is Islamic .	-2.4282
Now , the state would not be a 93-year-old man who has brought to big services and without the outside Bayrous and perhaps Germany , even though nobody would endorse the regulatory temperatures , would finally be in peace .	-8.5577
