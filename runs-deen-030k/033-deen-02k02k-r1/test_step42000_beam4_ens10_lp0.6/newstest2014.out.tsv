The most spectacular surprise is the most recent surprise of the long-awaited works by Mark Halmen and John Heimann over the election campaign 2012 , “ Double Down : Games 2012 . ”	-6.0135
The Times is an exemplary book of the nearly seemed book , and it was reported on Thursday that the President of the president ’ s top-range sessions and reviews at the end of 2011 to find out whether it would be a silent hope for Obama ’ s silence better if it were to black .	-8.5171
According to Jonatha Martin , national correspondence of Times , the book of the leading efforts to the campaign and the wine house of the former house of Staff Bill Dalley , who wanted to measure the effect of the former Foreign Minister for Foreign Affairs .	-6.7618
The potential exchange rate was a strict home inspiration within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oveal Office .	-2.9234

“ Double Downlon ” claims that Daly was launched at the leading efforts to exchange their “ enormous , personal relationships ” , finally , we were opposed to such a copy after the data demonstrated that the candidate Clinton Clinton would not improve the Obama ’ s office .	-7.3998
In an interview with Martin , Daly confirmed that the government really had overrun to replace Biden by Clinton .	-2.7557
“ I spent a whole series of things we should consider in recital , and that was one of them “ explained Daly . ”	-4.7269
It must be remembered that the president had then enjoyed horrific conversations , so we would like : ‘ ye Gd ’ , what we do ?	-7.3414
While Dalley inquired the investigations as “ booted cargo ” , Martin said with Anderson Cooper that , during the campaign , the campaign was used to find significant burdens to find whether such a view is paying for the blood .	-8.1027
“ In campaigns , however much money is spent on reviews and outlines , if you don 't feel serious about something “ stated , Martin in AC360 .	-6.4597
It is not clear , however , whether Obama revealed his team about a exchange of exchange .	-4.5321
Martin said to CNN , he was requested Dalley whether his dalier Boss were aware of the potential exchange rate .	-4.4738
At the same time , Daly said that he was not aware of the possibility of modification “ realised , ” he had rejected the earlier statement that Obama ’ s president was awaware of . he was as as “ as as possible . ”	-11.6206
Martin added that “ Double Downlon ” does not provide a definitive response to the question of whether the political songs were achieved by Obama ’ s political traditions .	-4.7435

George Kerevan : European determination exists the Scottish election .	-3.4008
A new day , a new shortage of independence .	-1.6877
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland must be needed to incorporate the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.7616
This delivers the keyword for stories of passenger controls in construction and a stable front along the highest level .	-4.5271
Indeed , the Strathlyde project has indeed been pointed out in the possible economic advantages that would create more travel freedom in the rest of Europe , but it played that – expectative measure – in the strain times .	-6.4607
Nor has nobody mentioned that EU member states are often liberating their strict rules if it is more favourable to them .	-3.7115
Since Scotland is not present for the Schengen area , the continued non-respect for Brussels would only be a small conclusion on what really wants to be done by the Scotland .	-4.5670
So , in fact , there is no story .	-2.0991
And one that has already arrived in the years ago that they are already at least 40 years ago : the first time I have mentioned the “ independence ” passenger controls at least 40 years ago .	-4.4901
This represents an interesting point in the constant recovery of these old history .	-2.1865
So why should we expect from an independent Scotland to be seen after the European pension ?	-3.8085
Why does the London James against Brussels , especially now ?	-2.5241
These are the real European news . The great plan after the war dealt with Europe is into stock .	-3.8443
The euro crisis has become officially diminished by the Eurocrisis .	-8.0252
Other parties in the EU want to be sensitive or wish to use the euro as a Community currency .	-8.9918
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party , alternative for Germany , was founded this year – nearly five million votes in the Federal election in September , thus making the effective democrats ( the Aqualition to the British Democrats ) from the B.	-5.8091
There were still delicate opposition to the plan to create a federalistic Europe .	-1.8823
The current economic crisis is turning out as a one-off .	-2.2901
Berlin and the European Central Bank imposed strict austerity , combined with the forced fishing jacket , where the respective national economy is required , many people believe that the project is being far from the single currency .	-5.5946
The euro has little to do that national governments cause excessive budgetary deficit – that was only in Greece .	-12.3554
Instead , the euro system has embarked its members on exchange rates , which are advantaged for German exporters – and would like to leave German politicians .	-10.6487
Without the possibility of evaluating the local currency , South Europe will be rebuilt with an integrated productivity determined with Germany .	-4.1240
The only way is to reduce wages and public expenditure – split from Berlin .	-2.0163
The current contacts and monetary problems are closely European productivity problem .	-3.2940
As the result of Brussels , “ green energy directives ” – a code of subsidizing French and German Energy businesses on the costs of consumers – the European industry compared with the United States for electricity and fourth facilities for gas .	-4.2675
This is a human-shared thing , as we were already able to see in Granmouth .	-3.8984
All wages of the world do not protect the European Petromise industry from cheap to be limited from cheap American shame to the dream.	-6.8532
As a result , a revolution is revolt , especially in France , the EU ’ s united cherader .	-4.5671
After the war , France ’ s political elite had the EU as a vehicle that was able to keep Germany and Paris at the moment with Washington .	-4.3448
But Paris no longer needed more than a death to political legitimacy and has oppressed Europe to fight its own economic policy , with the appointed French economy .	-3.7432
The result is : Marine Le Prime Minister , EU undeniable Front has just made a decisive vote and thus prove to the government socialists on three levels . a thth, , a thought , unfor, and the sense on .	-19.4895
The Front National Party is now the most popular party in France with 24 % of the electorate – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it would not be able to spend a split in the right spectrum automatically for the left .	-4.6481
What do you like Le Pen with her new popularity among the sons of the workers class ?	-4.8342
They want to use the EU elections next year to make an Anti-EU elections , Anti-Community mension block in the European Parliament .	-13.7329
If the anti-EU parties are well adequate to these elections – and this is very good – then the European Parliament could first dominate such a block .	-3.5681
This is the point that I would like to extend : not just in the future , the growing rescue instrument against the EU and the common currency will meet the abolition of the euro .	-4.8571
The EU will not disappear , but it will rather be doing anything like the “ Europe of sovereign nations ” that will protect General General General .	-4.3272
Germany and a few of its satellite economies perhaps maintain the euro , but France and South Europe are returning to their own currencies .	-2.1113
I expect the UK to move away from this project , to the hope of avoiding the US .	-2.6515
However , Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific Regulation nearly illustrates that Britain alone is going to be in the atlantic regulations . this is as a means in the A.	-6.1167
What will Scotland remain all ?	-2.7881
We can decide to seek an area of ( in the last consistency ) SMEs England .	-3.2985
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including that , too , Berlin and Brussels , what they can behind .	-9.4460
I had to say that Scotland might be in a blocked European crime and very well if we keep our own currency .	-3.4429
Cooperation with others , similar to the countries is not easier in a more federated Europe of nations .	-4.2355

Private flights can now be read from flight to landing their electronic device for reading , work , games , music , and the review of films , but not with the handle of the new directives which were published on Thursday by Federal Aviation ( FAFA ) in the United States .	-6.3507
But the passenger should not expect the passengers to be implemented immediately .	-1.8535
As she was implemented , FA-staff members would be subject to a press conference mobile from the particular airline , said FA-staff Michael Huerta on a presconference .	-6.0707
The FAA airlines must point out that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the debt books of aircraft and the regulations for the restaurant of the new rules according to the device .	-16.9609
The FAA explained that they have already received some airlines , which would enhance the use of available electronic equipment in aircraft .	-2.9761
Under these airlines , Delta and Jeta blood have also been present for those airlines .	-3.8189
" The plan was to be approved as soon as possible , for the enlarged use of electronic devices , the FAA was aware of a release .	-5.8213
At present , passenger shops , tables and other devices must be closed if aircraft is closed .	-2.7230
They must only reach them if the aircraft has reached a level of three kilometres and the capital has green light .	-4.8122
Since entry into the landscape , passengers must go back and must not be restored again , the airport is applied .	-5.6476
After the new directives , airlines could be secured against electronic disruption , their passengers could also use their passengers to explain devices at Start , landscape and rolllls , explained the FAA .	-5.6956
Most new passengers and other firms that were used for the use of Wi-Fi in greater maximum should correspond to the criteria .	-3.9172
Latura Glading , President of professional airports , welcomed the changes made .	-3.6914
When the new rules are implemented – and we work closely with the airlines – both sides of them will benefit from " Completed glass .	-4.4033

FAA may probably help to ban certain electronic devices in Start and Agriculture .	-2.7285
Last month , Mark Rossenker announced the National Transport Agency Sadday Board , Security experts for national transport issues on CBS News , trade would still be viewed as a risk .	-5.1966
“ Try is a problem , not only because they may cause potential disruption in navigation devices , but because we know that the FCC can devote from the air and lake . ”	-6.0705
A consultation association of the industry , which was carried out by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government had a broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-5.1701
Over recent years , pressure on FAA has increased to block restrictions on the use of restrictions .	-2.8456
Clair Michael from Missouri believes that there is no valid safety green for ban on the ban .	-5.2927
The restrictions are also increasingly hard to be implemented , because the use of the device has become ever more difficult .	-3.9078
In some studies , the speech dealing with until a third of the passenger is corrected or ignoring the device .	-4.2881
In 1966 , FAA began to limit the use of electronic devices by flight after reports on Navigation and Communications were awarded by passengers by the UK-radio radios that were awarded at the time of the new technology .	-5.7208
New aircraft are far from dependent on electric systems than earlier generations of air vehicles , but they are also constructed and approved by the FAA that they do nothing about electronic Interferences .	-4.1681
Passages have been provided for some years now if the airlines have been improved .	-4.3035
The Managers adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also unrecommended across the conferences .	-4.9009
The overwhelming majority of passengers should be suitable for the stronger use of electronic devices to the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.8352
Today ’ s electronic devices are generally less pesticides than previous generations .	-2.3612
Electronics , for example , only minimum radiation when you make a breakdown .	-13.0291

Douglas Kidd of the passenger association of Airlin Passenger said that he would be the opinion of the disruption through the device , even if the risk is minimal .	-5.0216
Other colleagues said that they only have individual reports of pilots that claim to spoke aircraft systems from the device , and most of them are very old .	-6.3405
The FAA ’ s collection , however , allows pilots to be permitted in instrument landscape under bad proportion , seeking to classify the patterns through the passenger .	-7.3291

There are widespread dissatisfaction about the internal market because , according to businesses , the benefits of Brussels would be to be part of Europe ’ s trading zone – even 40 % of the big companies that are traditionally pan-European .	-15.7990
Finally , and this probably says most , our question of economic leaders suggests that a significant majority of Britain wants to see a course of change to the agreement and a relationship based on the EU that is not based on trade .	-5.0731
The knowledge that comes from all sizes and leading companies shows that the economy urges to a “ sensible change ” which restricts the height of trade to Britain .	-5.7743
It is a concern – a change of the agreement and better conditions for Britain would result in 16 % of opinion in favour of the EU 's association in a referendum in a referendum .	-3.8078

Business Philip Hare questioned about a case that a YMCA employees were classified because of children ’ s infectious pornography and another in which YMCA Carniah Hall was condemned for him because of the abuse of children .	-6.8161
Hare said , Gail Furness , one of the Commission ’ s statistics views that he was aware of the first case , but it did not recognise the second .	-4.7285
He acknowledged an inaccurate declaration of YMCA against the Commission that the Commission was also unprecisely in the claim that “ there has been external review of the YMCA in which YMCA was recognised as a previous front in child security . ”	-6.0301
As far as the Commission shows , the YMCA was established , that it has received the second low assessment of four possible in a quality audit of Education and Communities ( Education Ministry ) in August of the year .	-4.9588
Hare , who began with 21 at YMCA , a familiar performance “ I says ” in the introduction of Lord says and not ensures that employees have been informed of their obligations in clarifications against the guidelines for children .	-8.2785

Hare declared that he insisted the depth of the YMCA NSW , his view that the lessons that the organization from the Jonatan-Lord interim ’ s organization were not to involve the “ the media ” by staff , and the pretext of it .	-7.7059
Hare said that the decision to restrict the staff on the signature of intellectual obligations has been made , according to the apologies of the business leaders of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-4.9483
