This is the point I would also like to ask for : in the all-embracing future , the growing debate on the EU and the common currency will meet the euro .	-5.9827
The EU will not disappear , but it will be as little as the “ Europe of ( sovereign nations ) that the General of Gaulle will be predicted .	-4.1934
