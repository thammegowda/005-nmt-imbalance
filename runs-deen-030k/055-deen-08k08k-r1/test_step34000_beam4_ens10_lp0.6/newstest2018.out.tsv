This final report says that Georgia 's interest rate was operated by 1964 in Reguldburg : ' Tokyotyotyoth ' golden , together with the fact that , by Dompilgrister R. in many cases , physical and psychological violence were used .	-8.6006
Precisely in the area of high degree ammunition , the penalties for the students were even more exciting .	-6.4301
Nevertheless , unlike many other complaints , many victims of general human life are underestimated and , in many cases , even greater violence reluctance with him ' .	-5.1483

How do you regard it as a biography of this report ?	-2.3105
Michael Henmann : if you are going to experience the trouble and use the whole 440 pages long report from before us , you still need to ask the Native Raf rate in all .	-6.8678
It is just eight pages again and it is clear from every state of mediation - or wireless connection in the terrible sexual abuse .	-6.7395

In this way , the vast majority of his teacher Georg Ratrider is a very excellent testimony of his teacher , he sees as an " guilty " , " Who is right " , " incompetent " and " experts " , as a very guittet teacher for the young people who are always using their homes , and children 's " and children " .	-31.1262

However , to his honesty descent , it needs to be said that such upbringing methods were evoked in the grid period , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , which were widely disproportionate with women .	-7.5318
Do you like this spectrum methods ?	-3.3030
Of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.6018

On baptism , a lot of those who have never understood him and got cool .	-4.9949
The truth is , however , the report is outfitted Georg Razer in any sense !	-3.9774
The media has been consulted very much about the issue of abuse in Regulators Dompan report .	-3.6620
Will Georgia 's interest rate in the report also forecast or judice with regard to sexual abuse ?	-4.0433
Michael Henmann : whole is clearly no .	-3.1123
No single one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks alleged to have confused the Dompanster .	-5.0755
Not even the parents were born .	-3.1721
" I have never had my father to talk about my father or my mother , said an empty supporter for the other , " It was all very intolerable " .	-4.7211
The real problem with regard to sexual abuse is not , but it is that most victims of famine .	-5.0861
If they are not even true to parents and stories , certainly not a Chorpher , but in some way would have been a Member of the perpetrator .	-5.4517
What view is the Dompanh pupils government 's role in relation to the abuse of accidents ?	-4.0311
Michael Heitmann : A question of a question of polluter : ' The sexual abuse of sexual abuse ' does not appear in the case of the publishing ( Georg Rates ) had legal knowledge at a time and could have been held in prison .	-11.1172
I think it is also true that it should be remembered on the part of his book ...	-6.2687
Just consider him about Sex ... - unthinkable . '	-3.3086
The report deals with the very clear outcome : ' But it was unlikely to trust students and / or her environment , in the context of investigation ' .	-6.5399
Sexual abuse is , Georg Razer , therefore , of all the disciplines .	-5.4264
He cannot be reproduced to his or her scores .	-5.0676
That is why there is no reason to link his good name with these disastrous crimes , as unfortunately in some cases it happened .	-10.8191
In the media , a lot of ' violence processes ' in Regulators Dompan was read .	-5.3800
The earlier Dompionship initiative under Georgia 's report calls for ' Wednesday ' .	-6.1764
What has he been accomplished with this accomplishment .	-11.0395
Michael Heitmann : This is indeed the major problem that , in the rapporteur , it has been intermixed and humiliated to an enormous amount of misuse and violence processes and any way urgent , Georg Rates .	-7.5939
But this is , in turn , an abuse of the report .	-2.4681
Since this is a question of arises : interfering with the agogy and the Gynaia at the Dompants , the abuse of sexual abuse and violence processes , and we shall say once again .	-9.5344
In addition , the report deals with waste from the time for 1945 , that is also from four decades in Georgia where Georg Ratzur was not Chorph of the Dompan .	-6.7091
The full inspection of carcasagogics , the cases in which Kngrad of dominant teachers have been closed and malnutritional and were evenated , subsequently , occurred all in the Premier budget and Pielelho , where truly unskilled circumstances have to be handmalmalmalmal. must his his his his must his his his must his his his must his his	-19.2552
But , with those who had Dompedi Georg Rander had nothing to do , because he befits the young people first to face when they were closest to the Dompan .	-6.8922
In what , like most of them , the issue was ' pre-ins ' .	-4.8424
It was only happy to give her cause , which is so much better treatment and for many even ' farms ' .	-6.1915
What was different to the Domnyman History ?	-4.0228
Michael Heitmann : As ruling has already discipline , but does not actually disrupt force .	-6.0869
And this is also true for Georgia , where the report talks that ' many victims of general humanity , and , in many cases , even more violence connected with him ' .	-4.7382
This is the most important example of this solution .	-5.3101
Yet , despite all their efforts , the report was defined only two timelines when it was thrown down by the hostel .	-5.3121
The first time 1970 / 71 , when he had just started to dismiss , and by the prejudices of a school that he was not effective and responsible , ( so the Zeung ) had nothing to hear , and then again after 1993 .	-6.4988
Satro Georgia 's Rate rate is consistent with its facilities in the world ?	-7.4090
Michael Henmann : no , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Dompanznynsis , which even produce the report even more reproduced .	-5.4829
That is the point that it would continue to regulate the ban on penalty .	-5.8196
Even in view of the risk of negative press published the most urgent need to put again .	-9.2230
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity was banned in Bayers long .	-8.7088
Then they found in a legal grey area like everybody of us know .	-3.7778
He has also been hard to appreciate for him , where the people may perhaps have floated or dramatically , and where the actual border was surged .	-5.4781
But he cannot say that he could have looked along with them .	-4.7071
That is simply not true .	-0.3204
Only in 1980 , the Canary capital punishment for schools in Bayers has been re-established .	-10.1407
Five Gaulia of Thurn and Taxis have said that it is unfair that today 's pedagogue should apply to the time .	-6.0207
How do you see that ?	-1.5229
Michael Henmann : We are talking about what is known as ' a tram of illeralism ' , in other words the danger of having been present moral measures .	-7.5154
So , there has been no right .	-3.6098
But of course this does not apply to sexual abuse which at all times was appalling , not even for what was contained in the pre-schools , in the form of contagion and violence in innocent children , which is already a long time ago about the ills .	-8.3006
All this is entirely horrific and I am glad that it is finally being done .	-3.7166
At the same time , I have to defend Georg Rates , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.2572
Its resources to discipline and punish , meaning olive and scratch down the tariffs and OP were spread across the 1970s .	-6.9868
As physical punishment , it has also been banned restricting itself .	-3.6644
Which image of his Regulators has given Georgia 's interest rates in talks with you for the book ' My breast of the paper ' ?	-5.6636
Km the subject of auditing penalty also has to language ?	-3.8782
Michael Henmann : now , in the book , there is a real life of its Bryh Joseph , a Pauline XIV. , you will find out that the Dompan is now being held in an unpatented manner .	-9.7259
Nevertheless , I do not forget that it has been a strict regime there .	-3.6357
But that must be said again : without this Perfectionism , without the inventory discipline , it would have been little possible to apply from the point of view of the more familiar national Regulations of Dumndogsburg , a institution of world forms of culture , cultural and artistic tradition in 1983 , although the US and Japan ( 1983 ) .	-10.3070
Keep and Bonbon is not only a matter of researchers , but with any success in the area where there are still discipline , passion and self-aligning .	-8.0877
When do you have a people , for Georgia 's interest rates in talks about their book ?	-3.6302
Michael Heitmann : The work on the Buch and , furthermore , I applied Georg Rander 's interest rates really well , and have still been shut down as a wonderful , heavenly genocide , thorough people who cannot afford to be found that he could not only imagine something like a meat .	-10.7045
I regularly select the way as many former dompions wander , 23 years after his enemies , regularly visit him , and he is almost a member of their family as a member of her family .	-11.4644
Those who were not willing to give him the same time for him ; they are clearly a minority .	-5.2933
Most Dompanzments are grateful to him today for having worsened their lives and the world of the Mussolini .	-5.7595
And that he is always a good , fathers - a strict father , some who might be - but it was also a divididor divide which they are today and day at night .	-8.1927
I would ask , once again , that all of the things that were pregnant , they are training methods that were at the moment on the agenda .	-5.8275
We can be glad to have long overcome this period .	-2.8925
But it is absolutely uneasy to put a man , just because he is progressive and a more progressive breader of the people to make the media scapegoat .	-6.5381
Since the horror intention is behind this , it is all too clear .	-3.9370
The report , which has just been published , is incomplete it .	-3.8249
Now , the decline in areas , a 93-year-year man who experienced great chains , and without the Bavaria and perhaps Germany would be aware of the Regession Dompan , at long last , to make peace .	-6.5888
