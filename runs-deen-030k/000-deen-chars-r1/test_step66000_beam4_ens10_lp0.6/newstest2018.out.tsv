The Americans estimated this , like Americans , therefore , therefore , inside Saddam Husseins on the Firdos Place in Baghdad in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.8035
Stepher millers , one of the key ideologies of the Trump regime , was certainly what he had a symbolic axt in a hitzen strike with Jim Acosta on CNNN on the proposals of the Presidents on the drastic instrument .	-6.5621

Lazarus - and their friends who are used to place their words after their death to base - was very good that they fully well aware of their high-political acts .	-4.0084
The sculpture should should show the links between French and American Republicanism by showing in a used classic education of classic imagination to the representation of freedom .	-4.2349
Lazarus changed this importance : In their health is no longer abstracted figure - they have received a voice .	-2.8508
And they have a different name : courage of exiles .	-1.9988

Hogans ’ s contributions have blocked the contributions of 450 people and solved that have expressed their opinion on its official facebook page .	-4.8199

" It is only facebook " , said many people .	-1.2445
But it is important .	-0.3792

This is a republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state , which is vital .	-2.1820

In connection with the reports on the abuse of abuse often , Papst-Bruder Georg Ratzinger .	-2.3268
Totally to unright , my authoriker and Historiker Michael Hesemann , who considers the implementation band " Mie Bruder of Papst " ( in 12 languages ) .	-4.1943
" I have to take Georg Ratzinger in protection " , because all that had nothing to do with him , he was the results of the conclusion report .	-2.6507
What exactly is the 440 side report which presented by the regulation with the attack of the Rules of Ulrich Weberg ?	-3.8198
Overall , 577 rules burger domspatzen were between 1945 and at the 1990s , with high plausibility " victims , " victims of transfer , 67 domspatz                 	-7.1662
In the conclusion report , the Georg Ratzinger who continued by 1964 to 1994 : ' Cooperation was therefore assumed that domcapel missions were applied by many forms of physical and psychical violence .	-4.7421
Precisely with high emotionality , punishment could provide students for students .	-8.8002
Nevertheless , in contrast to many other decisions that many victims of the general violence and therefore even positive increases in cases of violence , despite violence of violence , with him .	-4.1860
In the Interview , Hesemann , as the conclusion report on the misuse candal in the Interview of Georg Ratzinger of its opinion .	-2.4840
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the ' preference of violence of violence on protection companies in the rules of Georg Council ' are another image of domcapel missions .	-5.8464
A great deal for many keys of his " human beings " .	-1.9251
In other words , he also appeared as chollerics and perfectionist , which has not been made a domspatz if a domspatz musically no top service .	-4.6103
How do you will you with the biograph report ?	-1.9827
Michael Hesemann : when you make the moment and the whole 400 sides of long report by behind the name Georg Ratzinger considers that the name of Georg Ratzinger considers this . It is a previous standard i          	-10.3791
It is essential to consider and he clearly clearly considered by any progress or central cases in the sexual cases of abuse .	-8.1347
The violence of violence at the proposal outside the violence of the proposals .	-4.2082
You can also prevent him from the later or first anything we have not taken seriously .	-4.3847
The domspatzengymnasium , on which he was effected by practical all commitments as these - ' solutions ' and ' better world ' .	-3.5464
This is also known about the majority of Georg Ratzinger a whole excellent access to , " writing " , " so " competent " , " competent " , and " competent " , competent " , when extremely competent lessons " which     you                                                                                       	-13.0218
Unfortunately , a minority difficult about his perfectionism and its high emotionality , which also leads to consumers .	-2.9349
This is not just collective and the key bodies on the grounds , but also free young people , but also free young people in the Haraes or Ohren , has already been prepared for years ago .	-4.9484
However , the fact that such a period method must be said that such production methods in the question that in the question time , which was prepared for the 1960s and 1970s .	-5.1051
Can you also remove such payment methods ?	-1.9259
Of course , I think each of us , which was born in 1968 .	-1.5684
I have also mentioned this in a global school , a state of gymnasium .	-2.5014
Compared with what it is actually in this report , namely the abuse of sexual abuses and violence excesses on the proposals , are freedom of consu       .	-3.5365
This is whether it is not asking for its commitment and its role as bruder of Bendict XVI , t has done many media expressed to him .               a   lot  of t h  s  a l        	-9.0407
On the bavailable papst , however , many that have never understood him , n a         h               	-6.3739
However , the truth is that the Georg Ratzinger rather in every respect !	-4.7562
In the media , in connection with the report was very much about the issue of abuse on the regulatory domestic pacts .	-3.4272
Will Georg Ratzinger in final report also be able to develop or communication in regard to sexual abuses ?	-3.1318
Michael Hesmann : when clearly no .	-1.7949
None of the 67 victims of sexual overviews to have the domcapel mistake .                        	-5.1450
Not even the parents were important .	-0.9977
" I have never said , with my father or my father or my courage about the ' , says a concern for the others , it was all very pienlike ' .	-4.9160
The true problem in the case of sexual abuse was abuse and is that most of shame from shame .	-5.1686
If they do not consider a part of elders and spirits , then there would be certainly not a chorleter that would have been a colleague of facts .	-4.3864
How do you not use the Domspatzen School Ratzinger role in terms of abuse ?	-2.6290
Michael Hesemann : A considerable school formulated so : ' Decent sexual abuses , I would not have a case in which he would have been able to have been able to deal with what he could have been paid .	-7.2384
I think it really is absurd for really absurd to exceed him ... Bubses urgently obtain clear or also open their people , international selections , tru trust                                       	-7.7821
That will be talking about sex ... - and can be ' .	-2.1855
Thus , the report on the whole clear result : ' that it confirms the preference of schools and / or the environment , could not be confirmed in the confirmation of the investig        .               	-6.1124
So far , Georg Ratzinger is therefore concerned by any means of free movement .	-2.9936
This cannot be prevented , he will not be prevented to prevent him or down .	-4.1853
Therefore , therefore , no reason to bring his good names with these extent crimes in connection , as happened unfortunately in some cases .	-2.8740
In the media was much by " violence excesses " in the government burger domspatzen .	-2.1641
The early Domcapelmists Georg Ratzinger ratzinger in the report ' Wegshause ' .	-2.8635
What he lives with this advantage ?	-1.6750
Michael Hesemann : this is the great problem that in the rapporteur was avoided and has been made a huge lack of abuse of sexual abuses and violence excesses , with three , George Council .	-3.9975
But that is exactly a misuse of the report .	-1.6442
Since this will be expected : between the proposals and the gymnasium of domestic pacts , between sexual abuse and violence excesses and violence , as we say , once again .	-3.4517
In addition to the report , the 1945 report since 1945 , therefore four decades , which was not chorleters of the domestic paces .	-6.2614
The entire predagogical paedagogy , the cases of sadistic lessons were legally shifted and maltrained and maltrained and included , including all the proposals of the rules and players .	-6.1506
But with the had domcapel mister Georg Ratzinger nothing to do , because he was the first to history than they were already at the domspatzengymansium .	-3.9674
On the was how the over-missioned access to the subject ' proposal ' .	-2.7281
It was only fortunate to be her , and so much better treatment and for many " paradise " constructions   .	-6.6254
What was the other to the domestic gymnasium ?	-1.6907
Michael Hesmann : as far as discipline , but not a sadistic violence .	-1.8047
And that is also in favour of Georg Ratzinger , when the report comes to the conclusion that ' many victims of general violence and therefore even positive increases in many cases of violence of violence ' .	-5.6955
This is still not yet to have the prevention of responsibility .	-3.6155
But , despite all efforts , the report only defined two time reports which have been reported to the proposals .	-3.1208
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he wanted to etable and by the presentations of a school , which was not worked and responsible , and then were nothing to hear that he was nothing he wanted to hear the 1930 .	-5.1486
Georg Ratzinger provided for the consequences consistently the victims ?	-2.4689
Michael Hesemann : no , because he already reproduced a brief of the director of the domespatch gymnasium , which even reproduces even reproduced .	-2.8701
This is what he calls on ' that in the proposal continues to be practiced ' .	-3.2094
Already , the danger of negative press publications recommended urgently .	-6.1133
Of course , this was naturally banned as legal clarity that has banned in Bavaria al p            h  w                         	-6.8005
They are still aware of the legal grauzones , as everyone knows .	-3.6656
Since this was also estimated , where the affects have been overlooked or dramatised , and where really the advanced borders have been considered .	-4.5827
You cannot always say that he could have been done .	-2.2658
That is simply not true .	-0.7157
Only in the 1980 , the professional penalties have been officially involved in Bayern .	-7.2091
For sting Gloria of Thurn and Taxis , he claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s pedagogical measures to the whole time .	-3.9018
How do you see that ?	-0.6529
Michael Hesemann : we really share the burden of the anchronism ' , therefore , the risk of past for today ’ s moral activities .	-4.2167
This has already right .	-1.4391
But , of course , has not been sexual abuse that has been developed at all times , and also for what has been considered in reconstraints and violence of innocent children , which has been considered .	-5.3837
This is all true , and I am glad to say that this is finally working .	-2.7416
But at the same time , I must accept Georg Ratzinger in protection , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.4420
His resources for disciplination and processing , therefore , and the harries and ohers , were further in the 1970s .	-3.8513
As physical performance has been banned , he has also been held strictly .	-6.7438
What image of his regulator time has Georg Ratzinger with you talking about the book " Mein Bruder of Papst " ?	-3.5859
Kam the subject of professional power ?	-1.5335
Michael Hesemann : now , in the book the life of his bruder Joseph , as Papest Bendicts XvI , contains its perspective , because its prospects the dompact only a n bener .	-4.1165
Nonetheless , I do not think it is a strict regime .	-2.4147
But , once 198 the end of the perfectionism , without the information discipline , it would have been possible without the information of 198 , it would have been possible for the world ’ s institution .	-5.5528
With Keksen and Bonbons alone is now a large scanger and bonbons alone , before every success , simply on which area , but always discipline , suffering and self-compliance .	-5.5883
What would you like to explain the Georg Ratzinger with their books ?	-2.3525
Michael Hesmann : through the work on the book and over the Georg Ratzinger really well known and again as a wonderful , humorously , fundamental , humanity , delivering and limited human people who live in the work .                                    	-14.8571
I agree with how many how many former domspaces patches today , 23 years after his emergency , regular contact to him , it is almost a Member State - and it is a Member State that has bee a M f a      .   I a Mem        	-5.4106
Those who have not been given today that he was strictly strict , that is clearly in the minority .	-2.9459
Most domestic pacts are grateful today for their lives and has brought the world of music .	-2.4866
And that he was a good , vaterly lesson - a strict father , but a strict father that may be , but also a lively valued respect pects today , which today they are still living today .	-8.8311
And please , everything clearly : everything we have been discovered , which were previously in the agenda .	-4.0378
We can be very much longer that time we have s   	-4.8061
But it is highly unjustified to make a man , because he is prominent and a still prominent bruder to make medial sound bock .	-2.9019
This is the best intention that is only too obvious .	-2.4678
The fact that the report was published , has been published him .	-2.2536
Now , the amendment would have been a 93-year man which has been great destruction and perhaps no one without the outside Bayerns and peace would never be able to finally in peace .	-4.7984
