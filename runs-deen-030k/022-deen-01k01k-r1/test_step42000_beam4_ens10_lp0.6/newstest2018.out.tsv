" The biggest shade we have , the people who work in agriculture and make thoughts for how they bring their working " , most of the citizens .	-4.9695
Farmers often face assistance often in criticism .	-1.8421
For the wine support of 25 participants in 2013 , 25 participants were incorporated in 2013 .	-3.9276
Opensation is about 40 hectares , which must not be continued until at least 2023 .	-3.3859

The landscape Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Wurtemberg allows state support for wines .	-3.1392
The objective is to comply with the Black War .	-2.6244
Archallenge is the action of a LPR speculation that calls for promotion .	-5.5624
In addition , the business area must not be more slaughter ( wanting negation over 35 % ) and must be threatened by increasing .	-15.8212
For the Fisherman Weidezburg Project 2018 , the motion of eight participants wish to build 24 cells , which would like to build nearly 16 kilometres .	-5.4770
The opening area is complied 35 hectares , the calculated costs amount to more than 12 000 euros .	-3.7187
Is nothing more hypocritical ?	-1.1172
Now is the White House of Trump advocates freedom status .	-2.2072
The most secure signs of a regime change is when they start to attack the status .	-2.1831
Americans appreciate these , just like any other , the carefully installed Sturz Saddam Hussein in Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.1358
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologies of the Trump regime , certainly knows what he was doing when he was a symbolic act in a historic conflict with Jin Acosta on the President of CNN ’ s proposals on the dramatic restriction of legal immigration with the freedom state .	-12.3582
In order to remain fair , Miller terms not the status itself .	-3.5353
A horde of Bostsing owners and Libety-Imiators would have held him if he had done it .	-5.3661
But their importance in particular , and in particular the importance they have been written as the famous idea of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 , according to the determination of the Denkman , his base .	-5.5291
As the Miller Acosta recommended : ' I do not want to go together a complete things about history , but freedom status is ... an symbolic freedom that exercises the world .	-4.5866
The idea that you refer to what was added later , not part of the original freedom status ' .	-2.6073
Millers are right , but as he explains itself , this is not really about history .	-3.5857
It is a question of the temporary resources on the previous words of Lazarus , which is the only one in which a state does not only immigrants , but the poor of the poor : " Deine Mühler , your poor , your own knowledge to add free , free of children , who thanks to a half of his children ' .	-10.8494
There was never a time when the ' elegant waste ' was better to view our screen .	-3.6074
Millers committed not in liberal criticism - he made clear that these people in Trump are not welcome .	-3.7356
This conflict because the importance of a statute is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict about America .	-2.1155
Lazarus - and their friends who plan to play their words after their death on the basis - consciously well that she is fully involved in a high political action .	-5.1693
The sculpture should demonstrate the links between French and American Republicanism by showing in a deployed classical performance in a deployed classic performance .	-4.1352
Lazarus changes this importance : in their course , the clear figure is no longer abstrained - it has received a voice .	-3.7219
And they are themselves a very different name : Mutter of exile .	-2.2581
The connection of the idea with the picture is a brilliant feminister Cup and a devastating attack on American nationism .	-3.2110
And , like Lazarus , the importance of the status , the people of rights wanted to change this long ago .	-3.4286
The great deal of study Rush Limbaughth , a sort of the Trump ’ s communication , argued in 2010 that the freedom status was not involved , but rather an early neovative conservative , the American flights in the world : ' Lady Liberal Liberty is going .	-7.8396
They should contribute the fackle of freedom from the United States in the rest of the world .	-1.7684
The fackle is not to explain the way in the United States ' .	-2.5112
Excellent Limburgh is wonderful here .	-3.8802
The importance of the status is quite clearly a question of the position of perception .	-2.1338
The great population indeed from Lazarus was to see how they look like the created , but hopeful people have been long and often hoped for the cover of ships .	-7.1692
It is true in terms of improving the world from the perspective of people who seek trying to improve the flight and an opportunity to improve their .	-4.4319
Their status meets the words of the hope and the will they need to listen .	-2.3153
And that is obviously not the perspective that the Miller and Trump would ever like to recognise .	-2.6493
Their fackle is not to explain the way , but the hatred which is the only source of power .	-3.5001
2017 : Neil Black lost Scottish members of the Britain of the UK .	-3.2834
Eilid Doyle recalls for a time when only two shots belong to the Britain .	-2.4977

" I speak with people in Scottish Institute of sport and think that they have done something about what they have done .	-2.0427
The Scottish athletes think that they are doing something about what they have done .	-2.3656
British Leathletics : It has done something to do with what they have done .	-1.5896
And , too , type of the street .	-10.4973
Whatever combination of circumstances is absolutely brilliant ' .	-2.0532
Several Scottish athletes are medal-winner , including Latura Mir and Andrew Butchart - who opposed to Sir M Farah on the 5,000 stricken , while Eilid Doyle was chosen to the team of the team .	-6.7028
" Eilid is quite different .	-2.6699
Their capital speech was unusual .	-1.9946
" A number of athletes , globally whether they were Scottish or even where they live or trained , were very motivated and harmonised .	-4.5060
The identity and the genuine feeling that the Eilid was brought , of course , was great ' .	-4.5540
The Commonwealth-Silemergency profits replaced in their fifth world majority in the 4000 horses said that ' it is unusual ' that 16 Scotts are in the British mandate .	-7.0144
Scotland has been the world ’ s total number of Atles , seven in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.5515
The middle of Muir will lead to this way and has two European corrections last year .	-4.4836
It will take part in the 1.500 m and the 5,000 pillar .	-2.5482

The mannation capital in says that they are huge " huge proud " on the fact that many of their landscapes are not only part of their country , but in some cases , also in the medle and fingers will be mixed .	-10.5077
" The particular attention to Team capital is that they were chosen by the other members of the Teams , so that it was so much honour , but to know that my team colleagues have voted in favour of me and I chosen to me something very specifically for " to add them .	-6.5121
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scotts that are part of the team .	-10.4365
It shows only how far we have come .	-1.1693
And they are here as an absolute athletes , Ahles who want to rise in podia .	-3.4144
What do I speak about capital ?	-2.0623
Yes , I think they were good .	-1.4812
I have just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world membership .	-2.6391
It is really important for us to benefit and benefit from making sure that we are again in the Olympia state .	-4.3689
I will get a second opportunity to go beyond and compete it will simply be a total atmosphere there . '	-4.2829
Blocked criticisms about Facebook : If you do not want a public office if you know the insistence of voters is unknown .	-6.2437
The father of our country knows something of poor press .	-1.4183
Americans set up George Washington , but it is unfortunate for a long time to conclude him , from domestic policy to its political principles .	-3.7025
He vaccinated criticism .	-2.4957
But his criticism did not make up of the silence .	-2.7905
For the year 173 , Washington said : ' the freedom of expression can be taken up - and dumm we shall be how damage to slaughter ' .	-4.8586
This brings me to Maryland to Goulner Larry Hogan , which must work more like Washington .	-4.1579
Hogan employees have blocked the contributions of at least 450 people and dissolved their views on his official facebook page .	-3.4600
And the American Civil Liberalies suggested him for the start of this week .	-2.6001
Whether the Government left the class as a fresh vol , and the online commentary was fully reacting with ' N , and ' ?	-5.4487
" It is only Facebook " , said many people .	-0.9628
But it is important .	-0.2325
And it is particularly important if it is a type like Hogan .	-1.8067
This is a Republican Governor in an overwhelming democratic state that is unsurprising .	-3.2469
He has the second highest approval of the 50 Government ’ s n.	-2.7297
Hogan is no reactionary heat .	-1.1804
He has shown a strong hand in leadership of its state and strict respect for the principles .	-2.3843
He was also very attributed to use Facebook as a primary means to combine with its electorates , and , for example , his harmony head to Chemotherapy on his side .	-5.3402
That is why the blocking of persons on the side of Governor - which is an official forum which is being described as an official forum , and from employees who are paying with public tax dollars - is ultimately necessary and ultimately dangerous .	-6.2177
In an interview with Washington Pope defended Hogan Sprerecher AMlia Chasse the actions of the Governor and argued that the blocking of comments continue to be nothing more than a modern .	-5.1301
But it is easy to use the picture of drugs or collected people who have found online .	-4.0686
The post spoke with some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.4905
And that is just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a company , and a prime , are not a trol .	-3.7508
They all said that their comments had respect to their comments , narrow , and not forward .	-5.4423
The Prior replaced the bibel in his post and applied to Hogan Catholic faith .	-3.8034
Lawyers Sarma Ramani of Bomani , Med , was not happened , but they asked to hatred towards ha.	-5.4395
" I listened to hear that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hatred crimes and other current news ' , writing them in the comments of the Neighbourhood Service ' .	-10.6015
" I appreciate this idea not , if a number of people on the same subject , they will be disregarded by so-called collective use , rather than a large group of citizens concerned " .	-16.2546
What the workers of the Governor as ' concentrated Spam-attack ' would probably call others ' .	-4.5015
The Facebook era makes it easy to switch a news by blocking a criticism or commentary on it by solving a negative comment .	-13.8266
It is much more cleaner than in early time when we had the same staff were said to collect criticism with critical guidelines and to criminate demonstrations .	-6.2788
But this happens in particular digital .	-2.0355
Hogan is not the first public officials who criticize the fact that he has received Facebook and other social media .	-2.9484
President Trump will clarify the Trump 's benefits committed by his Twitter Fed .	-3.2024

At time Washington , the time of the rich ports had a similar effect like the Internet .	-2.5990
The number of times has been damaged between 176 and 1800 , and anonymous breakdown to its leadership .	-3.0764
And even then , Washington had anonymous trol .	-1.7882

Petitions , which criticized the historic documents adopted by the Treaty of Ammiy , trade and the shipping criteria with Britain , accounted by the historic documents that were adopted by the online Paper of the George Washington Project .	-5.6711

freedom of expression , different and discourse are one of our nation .	-2.6588

Others have tried and failed .	-0.9493
Perhaps you can do John F. Kelly !	-1.6433
If so , he will be the first .	-0.6183
Politico reports that the new steady of the White House is planning to restrict information on President Trump - including the reports of news media - in the hope of maintaining equal course in a equal cour.	-4.1255
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawy :	-1.7502
" As John F. Kelly , the new State of the White House , working together with the first work he together , he was a main problem in President Donald Trump , who wants to be repaired : poor information that he wishes to the President of the President .	-6.0792
Kelly staff said that information should follow him - whether on paper or in Brigs - because the President would meet better decisions if he would receive good information ' .	-4.1327
Kellys Diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to mention Trump by supervising its media .	-2.5759
President Trump ’ s relationship to the Trump is rich decades - and now , where he is still very strong in the White House , its television is still strong .	-4.1645
When Trump was destroying a unfair rapporteur , it was productive to demonstrate him that he received a fair rapporteur of societies who were convinced ' the former election adviser shadow Sam Nung in February on politicio .	-5.0331
Politics Tara Paleri wrote that ' the key to keep Trump ’ s consumption under control , six former electoral officials are in favour of ensuring that his personal media consumption ' contains a steady lot ' .	-4.3872
Okay .	-1.8950
But the idea that Trump ’ s Trump has ever been " under control " is allowed .	-3.5434
Perhaps this campaign is something we do not know that Trump without their interventions nor fuels .	-3.2192
We will probably learn about the table that the Trump has not ended .	-2.9608
If he was already able to keep his employees some time , applying him , then their efforts have .	-5.5634
But nobody has consistently prevented Trump ’ s control .	-1.6799
One part of the problem is that people in a White House adopted themselves from competitive parties , are always trying to make their own agenda by presenting Trump by presenting their views of the world , perhaps the views of their views .	-5.1732
Politico - all of this history - reports in May on the behalf of the advisers to lead the President of strategic reasons for desperate information .	-4.4310
This was a example that was described by reporter Shand Goldmacher :	-2.2685
" Actual and former Trump officials say that Trump like a vulcan respond to negative press exchange , especially with such damaging licks and that he will rise to the destruction of these studies .	-5.0973

Trump lay asked the Article and find staff about Walsh ' . a stcallwas in the called to . , a in , and , , the and in .	-15.3760
Goldmacher indicated that the former Stebsche Price and the General Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " has attempted to impose a system of managing and documented the Trump . "	-5.6349
How has this class ?	-2.4502
Kelly three months later attempts to do the same .	-2.8872
Perhaps he will prove to be more effective managers as a price , but Trump still is still the impulse of self-, and his advisers still influence .	-4.3195

There are drugs poverty , politicians , business businesses , journalists , which are authorised to face the salaries of government or the Kartelle , to face a catalogue of crimes that dangerous chaos of Mexico .	-4.8433
There is no reputation of the violence , and while all the country lives in the whole country are increasingly journalists : at least 25 , since the President Enque Pena Nietto in December 2012 , 589 are after attacks and threats of excessive protection and drugs up to this year since the President of Enquota Nieto in December 2012 .	-7.4175
The latter is their heart and their inspirator of Riodce , the founder of Javidez Valdez Cardenas .	-5.2904
" The biggest error is to live in Mexico and journalist , " wrote videz in a variety of books on violence in connection with drugs .	-2.9878
His lack will be deeply recommended , although its presence is all presence - a large photo of Valdez , who shows its middle with the word " Justice " , depends on the fashion of the Riodoce-building of the two years of Reporters in the three years , Aarbarra , Iraq and Mirami Ramil , T-Shirs , who will be handling with its history or shower .	-8.7073
The Workshop is less than two months after its death , and the reporters discussed over their shared issues , the tradma , their alpine dreams , flagship , paranoia .	-4.6776
Although 2010 was established a special federal management to work the cases of journalists , this is the right to protect journalists only two criminal procedures .	-3.7909
As with most thousands of thousands of murders who have been connected with drug trade and organised crime , the murders of journalists are only rare before the court .	-4.0631
They are still indispensable to treat the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are unsolved and , despite the terrain is still more tragic .	-4.2109
Without information about murders , without justice , the meeting on the discussion of security is saying Iraq .	-2.7201

Furthermore , a woman and two growing children left child.	-2.0692
Equiet to fly in Culiacan free .	-3.4561
But on the subject of Valdez there is nothing more practically than Swiss .	-2.6302
Since Guzmans has been arrested last year and delivery in the United States in January , Sinaloa was one of the losses of the country , as rival groups are fighting to meet the vacuum .	-4.3488
It is nothing that in Sinaloa every day or several people on the road are shown in the streets or that peace is fully diverted by double , second-few masoles for drugs that are greater than many houses for life .	-5.9598
Remember that there is a state of ' reputation ' if only a cartel control over the coastal state , with its valuable ports and drug trade routes in the United States .	-3.6457
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojquez ( 60 ) , a co-legitimate and director of Riodoce , with the debt that he was not able to protect his friend and not protect it .	-4.0659
It believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-0.8596
First , in February , published an interview with Damas Loppez , a leader of the rival cartelling demonstrations in war with Guzmans .	-12.2462
This publication may have delivered the shoe had to sell any expenditure on the part of the expenditure once they were delivered to newspaper time-.	-5.4284
The second mistake is not to force Valdez following the decision adopted a different time that the same story had published the country to leave its own security .	-4.1296
Valdez was a last reading in Mexico and Austria , and its deep is seen as a milestone in the Mexican violence against journalists .	-3.1396
He had survived so long that his friends and colleagues advised that he would always be .	-2.4050
He was in 2003 as an experienced reporter for North City when he was involved with five colleagues for the establishment of Riodce and 50 US participation .	-5.6834
In Sinaloa , it was impossible to pursue journalism without saying the beef problem , " said Bojorquez .	-3.8972
The time deserves a reputation for the courageous and honorable rapporteur , and the revenue and advertising .	-3.5105
Reporters were able to publish hard studies without fear of censorship and the leser was fascinated by a publicization in which they read history , which nobody might not deal with .	-6.6357
At the justification of Riodce , she received the least ' Maria-Mors-Cabot-Prize ' for its rapporteur in Latin America .	-3.7001
In the same year , Valdez was the ' International Presse Freedom Award ' of the Competition on the protection of journalists for his courage in the persecution of Mexican drugs , where she continued to carry out .	-5.3275
He was voluntary to make sure that he had fear .	-2.2656
" I should like to live " , he said time for the CPJ excellent .	-3.2328
Drug trade in Sinaloa is a life " , said in the last October in an interview with Rompaviour TV .	-3.8589
" They must assume the task that you as journalists - either for example or ples of damage .	-4.6574
I do not want to ask : " What did you do so in the light of so many deaths ... why do you not say what was before ? '	-3.7585
The Riodoce-Team dismisses Valdez , the space of harbour , the friends , the friends and the great poverty , a teacher who knows how to survive .	-8.0740
They trust in his routine .	-1.8655
He would always be his choice .	-2.5618
It would always be at El Guayabo , who bar against the office , and they always have the same table .	-4.1543
Will they ask them : War its love to the routine be available ?	-3.0115
His death also has forced to ask their own opinions about how they can do best and remain able to live in the best .	-15.5717
" They will not be if you do with their women , their children , their business , their huge starting and land turn " to move drugs .	-4.8346
These things were not permitted " , Bojorquez .	-1.6884
The result is , even in the best time , a high level of self-sustainability and self-maintenance .	-2.5395
Its own industries trust .	-1.8802
If it were wrong , then the situation is wrong .	-3.8273
The door is said , the heart of the Riodce Andres Villarreal said that " Germany can be a sense that can be disappointed with Javier " .	-6.4019
The old rules , as he and other say , are no longer succeeded in Sinaloa - not just as in Tamulipas , Vercruz , Guerrero and other states where a future mixture of luxurious smugled , weakened institutions and corrupt governments officials .	-7.1466

They also had an exposure to the state spending , which focussed on the home ’ s main city ’ s govern.	-4.9310
And there was a group carried out in one of the first restaurants in Culiacan , a block of the office of the state management .	-3.4715
There was no official word about who has been carried out or as happened , it was caution when it was time to write what everybody knows : the restaurant is a long-standing of drugs and authorities .	-4.4551
A reporter from public signature that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician , which is involved in the ruling institutional revolution ( PRI ) , one that is almost the century of the political levels affected by all political levels .	-5.5065
Recently , several PRI Governover were accused by high cases of corruption .	-3.2480
Villarreal buat the reporter to write over previous incidents in this Local , including one that son of " El Chapo " Guzman " Guzman " .	-5.7436

But the death was not new for them and its Community .	-1.1639
They said their hand to return to Tws on people in the Canfield drive .	-13.8347
There were photos of the police and people who wrote , and from a man who claimed to be the browser father that leaves a picture with the recovery : " Fulusson Police has just left my unarmed son " !	-6.6698
They observed a live feed in which a police official group of demonstrators with a single hand and state .	-3.7467
In another video , they said , another police officials said : " I will be delighted to you ... "	-5.3509
" This is not usual " , remember Ferrell to its say .	-4.0782
This is not the sort of Mord , which we have used and which we can call typical .	-9.7556
At this moment I had key front .	-3.7345
I was aware and asked ' .	-2.7481
You 'd go back and start next day .	-3.4008
After the landing was 23 hours they had their 6-year deaths from the House of their father and decided that the two morning would drive to footson next morning . the senwas .	-16.6597
What happens in the following three years with Ferrell and Feruson is the subject of a new documentary film , " house Street " , in children from 11 .	-4.6533
It is a history of survival and the protests , loss and losses , strengthening and resistance which insists of people who have lived in the Community and have the roads to ask for answers .	-4.4417
When Ferrell , with their deaths , who had a blood class and a passing crop , after Fuerson , spoke the two conversation they had an uncounterproductive time before this morning » about the black experience and the black state « .	-9.1348
" Dou only remind you how I learned when awaiting people must fight for what they think of ? '	-5.4029
" We are still going to follow because the police has been killed a 18-year-old jobs and that was not right .	-4.2766
I was not able to take them ' , said Ferrell later .	-3.5546
" This is what happened today is a high point of what happened in the past .	-1.7805
It must be known and they will be involved in that .	-2.8338
It must be well developed not only activism and organisation but also the various stories of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we have to do to free to free ourselves .	-3.5252
Even though I have the good fortune to give her experience in which they personally do not experience a small racism , she is not different than the next black chil.	-4.2694
I feeling that I would point out to her bad service to keep them " .	-10.8184
The first station when they campaign in Ferusson , found at the Suth Floriday , was a place towards the police authority , which was created to a campaign as the activists aimed at officer Darfur Wilson ’ s possible .	-7.7744
There are plenty of tours and their daughters linked to a local business holders that made up again .	-5.7540
They are prepared to make them in demonstrations .	-2.5404
Slowly , the new type of activisism began to adopt cold shape .	-5.1189
" My activism changed after 9 August totally , it said , and noticed that it was a study of the university of Misouri St. Louis President of the Minority Study Nurses Association and justice in Esssociety and health inequalities in the centre of focus.	-8.0180
" I had no experience in the organisation .	-1.2002
It has all gone ' .	-2.0029
A week later , Ferreell was held during an evening demonstration Sabah Folayan , one of the co-regime of the film .	-4.2613
Folayan said , and her cameras Lucas Alvarado Farrar just wanted to document " what happened .	-2.4720
A question came to the sense of question : ' do you document or try to find a history that could use it ? '	-3.5268
This skepticism has been threatened by inappropriate cases of people , often from White Paper - in a Community that benefits from their pain and resistance .	-3.8222
As Folayan recently stated in an interview : ' We had heard that people who were born and born in favour are not satisfied and their votes do not wanted to take others ' .	-5.8040
Folayan had already worked with the then Co-Register Damon Davis , a artists in the area of its activity known for death contact .	-4.9852
His commitment brought the project closer together with six other hometomic consequences the team of " Street " in the years af.	-3.9111
This " documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or with us .	-2.8553
" This was the main reason for me how these people are set up , because I shall be put forward ' .	-3.8418
The objective was not to focus on Frilla experience - to show that the movement ' is not ' a meessa-leader , but with a Community who mentioned " Folayan - they proved as the official participants in the film .	-6.1545
As a result , the documents of " homes Street Streets ? " surprising personal aspects of Ferlles life , as they lose and their women . diare . , reand . . , reve. .	-14.7405
" I felt like narrow " , said Ferrell and lawyer than they had the product for the first time .	-5.2078
" But I understood that there should be some violation of these work and human rights in respect of black people ' .	-12.2930
Furthermore , Ferreells repeats the role of women in the broader Black Live-Material movement .	-3.2400
Two of the three reasons of the movement designed according to the lack of Tenager Trayns of Martin in 2012 , the film " Blacklivesmantter " in social media , identified as poor .	-6.7945
" Black , school women in leadership positions have contributed totally ' , said Ferrell , " and therefore we fight in various fronts .	-3.8308
Women must black up the main burden of everything ' .	-3.0348
Folayan agrees to note that ' the movement of women and many women lack women were aborted ' .	-4.2554
It insists , however , that ' this is not an affirmative type of action ' , which was selected because of their identity as a heart of the film .	-4.3333
" It was the person who carried this energy investigated " .	-3.1925
" It is not a coincidence , even though it was preferential front because it is a black life at this book as a black , women is so much on the game .	-5.4993
You know their energy through the screen . "	-2.8871
Rather , the news camera has long disappeared , but the Israeli links between the community and police continue to exist .	-4.6264
Ferre is on guaranteeing for 2 <unk> years because of blocking is a car when a demonstration comes to a demonstration .	-3.6932
It describes the social atmosphere of the presence it calls its home : ' A chaos ' .	-3.1792
Nevertheless , she came to a start and they feels commitment to this money , since they were three years ago in Fuelson on the street .	-6.0076
" It is our duty to combat our freedom .	-0.9990

We have nothing to lose - outside our chains ' .	-0.9562
From " TV series " until " big choice : TV series discusses Bit-Galery " .	-4.4356
The Bit-Galery moves people , although it is not yet long ago .	-3.5065
But the idea of a purchase centre on the south of food revenues since the first presentation 2009 advocates the population in supporting and opponents .	-3.9477
Califying the subject is not little .	-3.4849
Volksfree and Bitburg is also discussed at our Facebook side .	-3.2719
Whereas one of the Bit-Galery said : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " that would be equally class " ( Nicole School ) , from the other side : ' Nicol is not a menu ( sign ) or quite simply : " size choice ) .	-7.5662
While supporters focus on the need for a gallery more customers into the city , benefiting from the rest of business , fears the opponents that then exercise the pedestrians .	-6.7862
In addition , gallery is planned precisely on the basis that is for the construction market holds in which 13 direct markets offer their products .	-4.5341
That will be the start of the construction stocks .	-3.5007
The Galerie machers want to integrate a market holiday into the new building - during the beginning room , the outdoor seats .	-4.9218
Simon rooms : ' We buy buying for many years almost have been in the construction market holidays .	-4.6073
Most importantly , our Eier , but also the eastern couples of landrous are still very real .	-13.7445
We also discovered the legislation .	-1.9311
We hope that during the construction of Galery , and above all , there is an opportunity to maintain this offer .	-3.2927
There are also cities in other cities .	-1.2166
In particular , the small market holds in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-2.1265
More specifically , " whether " Whether direct market is seen in a market holidays in the Galerie , come into the level of the rent .	-6.5947
However , the new project must not be low in addition to the new project . '	-4.2104
Eva Kilic : " Woe to sales in Bitburg ?	-2.4286
Whether clothing , cheque , drugs or supermarkets : I find this overflowing .	-3.7027
We have already enough enough on that .	-9.1626
You see how many loops are living here - some have been here for months and years .	-2.7146
However , since there is not even a regular weekend market , it is so important for us to remain the market content at least . , , we are in this , . , , , , , , , , , , . , ,	-9.2573
The fact is that there is the offered goods that are widely offered by the producer , is largely offered by the producer and is three prices .	-4.4791
As you see , land business centres are listed only by larger companies , because the local misleaders are often not sustainable for a single dependence .	-5.6208
Having said that special business is not lost and that is still disappearing , even though it is still disappearing . the is , the is not , and the is still .	-9.2536
Wolf Fandel : " A purchase center with a market holiday for me .	-2.9051
And the galery does not fit after Bitburg .	-1.8200
Above all , where are the construction market holds during the construction period ?	-2.9553
The old Edeka would be a solution - even though the Bit-Galery is actually common .	-3.4285
Are it the business of Bit-Galery previously to represent all business from Bitburg ? '	-3.5289
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-8.4608
And a shopping centre , which is not necessary .	-2.7280
In my view , it would have been better to promote a proper construction market rather than promoting this galery .	-1.9731
But for a far-market holiday gift , thanks to the railways , many - as I find - useful barriers in Bitburg do not set a place .	-7.2312
When the building market is done , again , a piece of culture will disappear . "	-11.6287
A happy similarity : artister creates portrait with Chelsea DNA DNA .	-12.5931
In the middle of the Friedman Gallery in New York , many stories are aware - white and needs which are almost unclear - the characters of the cocktails .	-27.9287
The 30 portrait was created by the artist Heather Deather Hagborg from Wangen and Hharshnitzen , who created from Chelsea Maning .	-5.2922
Maning suggests the commitment from the prisoners of Lavenos , where the previous secret analysis came into a 35-annual penalty contract after she was kept diplomatic missions about the Wikiak Leaker ’ s website .	-7.2445
The new exhibition opened on 2 August , is A Becommeng Research ( an application ) .	-4.6381
It is the product of two years correspondence between Dey-Hagborg , which disciplined their expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and managing , a transfer and weak disciplines , whose condemnation of Barack Obama was transformed only three days in his office .	-5.1229
Dey-Hagborg has created the algorithm analysis of the DNA , which was created by Maning , and from the 30 ports that someone could look at this geographical data , a charge of intellectual comments not only on the form of DNA-data - the many interpreting how they can be interpreted and independent interpreting these interpretations - but also on the interpretation of this id.	-8.9758
Maning , which was born as Bradley Edware , but on the one hand of its perfect identification as Mrs , was condemned in 2013 because of six charges against the specialist law , computer fraud and diebustle .	-6.2200
Through the prisoners , their pictures were expressed , so very much that there was a single photo - no unique , black self-white influence , in which maning has been inadequate and platble pieces , with which they associated .	-9.1124
In 2015 , Dey-Hagborg was just successful by the large success of its 2012 project ' Straus' .	-3.7196
This produces artist priorities from foreign artists such as cigarettes and Kaugumma by extracting the DNA from the waste to see a picture of how these people could look .	-6.2343
This was the time where they received an email of a period of time aggregazine .	-3.7337
" They introduced an interview with Chilsea Maning , whereas they were prison , and they wanted a sort of Port to accompany this article ' , explained Dey-Hagborg in a new exhibition .	-5.2914
And they did not visit this time , and they were not being photography , so you wanted to contact with chelsea and asked whether they wanted to make a DNA .	-4.9701
The artists and their independent courage have been uneasy breakfast that expanded several years in during the period of two .	-5.2844
They even look at Shoti Kanuno illustrated Comic " Suppressed Image " , which would change a future in which President Chelseas judgment would be and it would be sustainable to see the exhibition personally .	-6.3482
The fact that Obama actually only a few days after the book was published , manninging free release for seven years in Cana ’ s military commitment to Cansa was a welcome kind of global cooperation .	-11.0638
There is also the opening of the exhibition and starting point , as Donald Trump leads a war against information from the Intergovernmental and against transit troops to find new competent ways to find new competent ways to bear the starting space that he should really go on .	-7.2299
When Dey-Hagborg followed the rare Timing of all these things , she said that " things stand out of a particular reason " .	-4.4186
In one of the wand of the gallery defended artistic statements , maning with their excessive signature ( which is " in their family names ) a end of the ' automatic splitling , whose basic gender , sexuality , and culture have been ' .	-6.6413
On the contrary , its membership DNA-Squence - a thousand-sensitive of Cs and GAs , in Beijing .	-5.9884
Dey-Hagborg hopes to show how the involvement of 200 books ( or nuclear emergency after the high-developed scientific lexion of artists ) is inevitable , at least in biological terms , we all are all .	-4.8688
" What people will be hopefully assumed that our Geneva is not familiar with who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are " said " Dewy-Hagborg , whose video values of 2007 , Spurrios Memoria is also to see .	-6.9116
" DNA data can count so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are ' .	-2.6349
The last piece in the exhibition that is maintained in one of its own area is a page of the above mentioned comcomic-November .	-4.1943
It shows maning how they build with a free release in the hand of the disciplinary cases of the United States such as King-Control .	-4.3059

Personally , the exhibition has not yet seen personally - as suggested in the Composbu , but if it is going to do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the mask , will be welcomed by its own geographic slaughter , as indicated by the Horde of Protests .	-8.1386
This was also targeted as everything in exhibition until the size ( 5 , 2 , Maningen Stature ) , which wrote genetic floors with blood groups .	-6.1689
" In the past , I was in the wall , but I wanted to feel that they feel like a human human beings , said Dey-Hagborg from the Ports .	-15.9557

But a new study claims the opposite : a diet that is rich to meat and dairy products , could link symptoms of patients with reasonable diseases .	-4.2110
The inherent state that is 1.3 million and in the UK 3,000 million , caused power and religion , reverse or bloood cases , violence loss , and extreme movement .	-7.4180
While the concerns concerned , meat and dairy products are being prepared to avoid their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University emerged that the specific nuclear adaptation of protops helped immunities to develop immunities that promote a tolerant data .	-6.9845
The performance of research , Dr. Marco Conolna , explained that immunities in the Darm patrol to ensure that damaging microps that are hidden in the elderly are not in the body .	-14.5287
Cells , which are able to dissolve decisions , from cells that promote the tolerance and protect the body without harmful movements .	-5.3648
If the balance comes to a widespread direction , one can result in a definitive error .	-4.2432
In experiments , it has been established that a kind of tolerance supports immunicipal cells , which contributes a certain bacteria in their integration .	-5.2449
And the bacteria requires Tryptophan - one of the benefits of profits - in order to solve the picture of cells .	-5.0678
Professor Colonna said : ' We have a link between a bacteria - Lactobacco club - which is a normal part of the Darm-microbioms , and development of a population of cells that encourage the tool .	-4.2448
The more typtopical had the microphone in their food , the more they had had had had more of these immunities ' .	-4.9152
It concludes that the combination of L. Reutteri and an Tryptop population is promoting less reasonable damage , if the same system also affects people .	-6.1202
The post-doctors in Dr Luisa Cervants-Barragan investigated a kind of immune that promotes the tolerance as they were outstanding that a group of studio buildings had such cells , but another group of the elderly was not accompanied .	-7.1278
They had to have had the differences with the dark robioms of the mixture - the Community of Bacteria , Viraces , and pillages living in the Maghr-Darmt track .	-7.0571
DNA-six bacternatives were found in the missiles , with the immunicipal incentives , but without the lack of the missiles .	-6.5588
Lumbers have been dropped in a stylish environment , so that they lack a dark robbiom and they did not develop this type of immunices , and they received the L.	-16.1967
To understand how the bacteria immune system follows the research of L. Reutteri in a flight and then implemented small amount of flows - without the bacteria - on the incentive immune that have been isolated by the houses .	-6.3921
The immunities developed to tolerance cells .	-2.0838
As the active component was introduced from the flow of flow , it has become a bytop-top metabolism that is known as Indol-3-milk acts .	-5.7948
If the research caused by Tryptoph in foot , the number of such cells have been doubled around 50 % , but if the typtopical values have been holded , the number of cells around half .	-6.9564
Dr. Cervants-Barragan explained that people have the same live transport cells like Mouse , and that most of us protect the maof Lin our Magad.	-6.7393
It is not known whether Tryptopical News developed in L. Reutteri developed the cells of people as in mistakes , but defects were found in terms of Tryptoph with reasonable dark disease .	-7.1960
You said : " The development of this press is likely to be something we would like to support , as these cells linked to the internal surface of the Darm tax .	-4.7257
The potential can lead to high type topics in the presence of L. Reutteri to expand this population ' .	-4.8517

Michael Hesmann : If you think the trouble and the whole 40 pages long behind the report , you have to ask him , therefore , the name of the George Council is at all .	-6.2367
It is , in particular , addition to pages , and it is clearly being discussed by every perspective of the middle of cases in terrible cases of abuse .	-7.3158
The violence texts also committed to the debt , outside his effect .	-3.9372
You can , at least , assess him in a late date or first demand , it cannot be taken seriously .	-5.6689
The dompatentary ymnasis on which he effectively called into practically all the questions - as they were " involved " Have " and " better world " .	-7.8510
For example , the broad majority of his children Georg Council is an excellent text , writing it as " warning " , " it is " right " , " complete " , " and " understandable " , as an extremely endeavourable lessons , the young regularly with cuisine , keeping and bonds " children " children " .	-8.4917
Only a minority is difficult about his perfectionism and his high level of emotionality that has already been breaking into the truth .	-4.9622
Not only with students and key bodies and the software of the body , but also redistributed already at home or horizogs , he has been given rise to those who have already been deeply regretted for themsel. they gradually , and apologifor it . , , , , it has been re.	-28.2328
However , in his honour ’ s honest rescue , it must be said that such education methods were widely spread over the 1960s and 1970s , far from parents such as teachers .	-13.2448
Can you also customize such a good method ?	-3.6216
Of course , I think everyone that was born before 1968 .	-2.4004
I have also lived this in a global school , a state gymnasy .	-3.0212
comparison with what is actually concerned in this report , namely the legal abuse of sexual abuse and the violence texts on the ultimate .	-4.5669
Whether it is not asked for his knowledge and his role as the breakdown of XVII to do that many media just cut down to him .	-5.2107
On Bayeran Pope , many who have never understood it , still fresh .	-4.4592
The truth is , however , that the report is stretching Georg ratings in every respect . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6504
In the media , there was a great deal of discussion in the report on the subject of regulators of domain patents .	-4.9916
Will Georg Council President-in-Office also sexual abuse in the conclusion ? , in relation to seabuse ?	-5.1833
Michael Hesmann : A clear one .	-2.3245
None of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claiming to have trusted to the document master .	-4.4069
The parents were not even the parents .	-2.0252
" I have never troubled to speak with my father or my mother about this ' , said a representative for others , " I was all very pleasant " .	-5.5634
The real problem with the declaration of sexual abuse was and , however , that most victims are Switzerland .	-2.7790
If they were not even parents and speakers , then quite certainly not a charter which would certainly have been a colleague of the perpetrat.	-4.4126
How does the Dompatzer ratings role in terms of abuse ?	-2.5369
Michael Hesmann : one asked students worked on this : " relating to sexual abuse , I see no case in which he charges ( Georg ratings ) would have been right and could have stopped .	-6.8101
I believe that ... also for really absurd that it is excellent to account him ... for example , or clear or even more opened up their parents , internal services , confidence etc .	-6.1144
This way you can talk about Sxx .. - friendly . '	-4.6924
It comes from the report to the very clear result : ' That is why it was confirmed in the run-up to students and / or its environment , could not confirm within the framework of investigation ' .	-5.1222
With regard to sexual abuse , Georg ratings is therefore free of every staff .	-3.4895
For example , he cannot be glad to prevent him or have the right to view it .	-4.8801
Therefore , there is no reason to connect its good names with these current crimes , as is unfortunately elected in some cases .	-3.8208
In the media , a lot of " violence texts " was due to the regulators .	-2.6542
On the previous document of Georg ratings , the report is going to be used in the ' Weschau report .	-6.2904
I think he lives with this draft life ?	-2.9633
Michael Hesmann : This is a great problem that , in the rapporteur , has been condemned and campaigned for a huge message of sexual abuse and violent texts and anywhere , in Georg , George Council .	-6.2834
But in turn this is a abuse of the report .	-1.7453
For example , there will be separate occasions : between the pre-schools and the Gymnasium of the documents , between sexual abuse and violence texts , and we say would once again .	-5.9021
Moreover , the report has been projects from the time since 1945 , including four decades where George ratings was not chhorrors of the dozen patents .	-5.5258
The whole appalling temporary edagogue which have been risked and materialized by Aslamic teachers , including reliant , have all been insisted on the preliminary education and players where really scandalous conditions need to be held .	-8.8902
But with which documentary major Georg ratings had nothing to do , because it was only too happy to face the young when they were already on the documentation process .	-6.8332
On the contrary , the topic of ' school is one of the most details .	-4.7089
It was only happy to come to her , and often the so much better treatment and for many of them ' paradise ' .	-4.0753
What was different about the document name ?	-3.0440
Michael Hesmann : De arrived on discipline , but there is no satistic violence .	-5.0042
And this also applies to the George Council 's report to the conclusion that ' many victims show the general humanity of resources and therefore in many cases , despite the violence of violence even related to him ' .	-5.5240
The highest nor is the pretext to have been overlooked .	-3.2803
But , despite all efforts , the report was only two times in which it was reported by the understanding of the proposal .	-3.6734
The first time 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself , and from the predecessors in a school , who was not actually effective and responsible ( the taxes ) , and then once again to 1993 .	-6.0128
Closing Georg President-in-Office of the circumstances is consistent ?	-2.7023
Michael Hesmann : No , in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the document centre Egymnamism , which reproduces the report even reproduces .	-4.3767
As such , he indicates that ' the auditing will continue to prevent the stimulus . '	-5.6801
Already , given the risk of negative press publications , there is an urgent need to be negative .	-3.8592
Naturally , that was the legal clarity that was prohibited to be prohibited in Bavaria as a prerogago . , , was , , , , , , , , . , , , , the the	-13.2119
Then they occurred in a legal construction area , as everyone knows .	-3.6073
It was also difficult to underestimate him where perhaps the concerns affected or dramatized , and where really the reliable border cross-border criterwas .	-4.6315
Yet it cannot be said , he would have always been watered .	-3.1362
That is simply not true .	-0.5686
Only in 1980 it was official to schools in Bavaria that was officially abolished .	-7.9724
Festern Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today ’ s pdagogical measures at the time .	-4.4778
How do you see this ?	-0.9563
Michael Hesmann : We are talking of historians at the case of the Annexism ' , so the danger of assessing the past in today 's moral measures . a is to this mo.	-6.4007
As it did , the bruths are already right .	-3.0228
But of course , this does not apply to sexual abuse , which was absolutely difficult to all times , and not to what has been done in the proposal of resistance and violence of children 's innocent children , the situation has already been done about the inevitably beyond the inc.	-7.6234
This is all quite pickly and I am glad that it will finally be working .	-2.7784
But at the same time , I must take Georg Council in protection , because all that had nothing to do with him .	-3.0623
His resources to discipline and punishment , therefore , were far from hard and the hard and the Ohrians in the 1970 .	-4.9552
As a physical punishment then it has also been prohibited , it also kepin this . the the was expresby and .	-11.3935
What image of his regulators has Regulator Georg ratings , for in the talks you have referred to you in the Book of the Pope ' ?	-7.3023
Can the subject of the test of this ?	-3.6639
Michael Hesmann : Now , in the book , lives of his breaks Joseph , the Papest Beach is subject to its perspective , since the documents are just a network .	-7.9412
Nevertheless , I do not deny that he introduced a strict government .	-2.6602
But this must also be said : without this perfectionism , without the requirement of unnecessary discipline , it would have been very little potential , from which the so-called national regulatory documents had been real institution of world transport , real cultural objectives and its music tradition , the same as the United States in 1983 ( Japan in 1987 ) and in 1983 ( 1987 ) .	-9.7796
With Keaks and Bonbons alone , there is no major scanner and any success in the field of discipline , lesson and self-conversion .	-6.0788
What do you live for a people because Georg ratings live in their book ?	-3.9927
Michael Hesmann : Due the work on the book and , furthermore , I have gone very well known George ratings and again as wonderful , fundamental , foundable , education and centering good people who cannot imagine that he can only do something alone .	-8.9674
I receive , as many former documents still experience today , 23 years after his ambition , regularly contact with him - he is almost usually blind - and as a member of their family .	-5.3524
Those who fail to assume him that he was strict to them are , therefore , clearly in the minority .	-4.0543
Most documents are grateful to him today for her life and have almost brought the world ’ s music .	-3.8833
And that he is always a good , later teachers - a strict father , certainly that may be , but also a living respect for which they were still built and reversed to them today .	-14.8321
Please clarify once again : everything we prefer to him is the planning methods that were then on the agenda .	-4.8831
We can be happy that we have long overcome this time .	-1.8827
But it is highly unfair to make a man , just because it is per minent and has a prominent breakdown to make medial scapegoat .	-5.4981
This is the bad intention that stands behind it is only too obvious .	-3.1140
The report , which was just published and published it .	-2.8069
Now that the state would provide a 93-year man who has proved great defense and without the outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany even know the rulers would finally know peace in peace .	-6.4424
