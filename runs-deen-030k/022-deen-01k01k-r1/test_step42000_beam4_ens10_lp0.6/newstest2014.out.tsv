Schildren ’ s city centre , most Roland Greholders explained the Community 's special choice of the train centre ' Airport ' .	-6.0954
The town is planned to build a selection of the tourist tunnels in the Western railway station .	-5.1394
There could also be bigger vehicles , for example , to transport the long-wood , for example , to be blocked in transport without the balance .	-5.3617
Let us therefore propose to construct a necessary study of users so that the city could push the closed period to guarantee an influential transport flow .	-5.2859
This was discussed in the Community on Control , as some missions doubt the need for a road link in doubt : Thomas Kipp brought with his statement on the point of criticism : ' May we do so much drive in the hand of vehicles ' ?	-6.8847
Most Thomas Hamas reflected this : the railway transition " Hirchen " rules regularly using language transportation .	-4.8768
Even Holz from the " Kuhbach " share partly over this piece of tracking because , until 20 meters , vehicles could not use the burden on the ports , because they could not be able to offer the main roads there .	-7.7763

The rebuilding of the transition to Germany ’ s transition could oppose a very different problem that concerns the rise in the strong increasing ' money houses ' .	-6.2599
The administration had investigated the transitional countries from the Austrian Bringer , because they had doubt doubt about whether the planned closure of money is still without any further possible .	-6.2846

The responsibility for contributing the town as road construction .	-2.1351
Environmental disputes could look for liability .	-2.5704
Because both the Holzabhu and the department in current exhibition , you should not agree with the rebuilding transition to argue that harmonized Has .	-5.9899
Also , at this point , the risk of collaboration of access to the transition of the current vehicles is clearly much lower than in the other railway transition , because the point is at the heart of the point , which consists of good link .	-6.9730
Even the heart of the main railway station needs to be in this position as far as it is concerned , no collapse is at risk .	-5.1251

FAFA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but not a hand-by-craft )	-3.9554
The aircraft can now be used from flight to reach their electronic devices to work , work , music , and the purpose of films , but not by handling the new directives which were issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FA ) in the United States .	-5.7931
But the passengers should not expect these changes immediately .	-1.2479
As fast as they were implemented , behind the respective airline stated by FAA staff Michael Huerta on a press conference .	-3.7618
The FAA must demonstrate that aircraft directives meet the new directives and that they have updated the trading books of airlines as well as the regulations in accordance with the new rules .	-4.2822
The FAA explained that it already received some airlines plans that would like to build the use of electronic devices in aircraft .	-2.8640
Under these airlines , Delta and JetBlue was also the airlines .	-3.3716
“ Just after the plan , we could approve the advanced use of electronic devices , ” the FAA was known in an availability .	-4.4054
At present , passenger smartphones , tables and other devices if aircraft is closed .	-2.2880
They must then again start again when the aircraft has achieved a high level of three kilometres and the capital has green light .	-4.3010
It is essential that passengers must restore their passengers and must not be again seen again , rather than again , that airline is transformed .	-14.0473
After the new directives , airlines could be secured , whose aircraft against electronic disruption could allow passengers to be used in start , landing and use on the rolling , explained the FAA .	-5.0513
Most new transport vehicles and other farmers that have been enjoyed for the use of Wi-Fi should comply with the criteria .	-3.4691
Ltura Gladi , President of professional airline , welcomes the changes .	-4.3263
If the new rule is certainly implemented – and we are working together with the airline society – both sides will benefit from it , commented glades .	-2.9609
We are honest to feel like adapting to this issue .	-2.1970
Nevertheless , the internet connections on the short , exchange of emails , text news or downloads of data under three kilometres , explained the authorities .	-3.9296
passengers are called for smartphones , tables and other devices in the aircraft .	-3.1074

They remain banned during the flight .	-2.9112
Regulatory competence for telephone talks is not in the Federal Community Community Committee ( FC ) , not in the FAA .	-3.3773
FAA may prohibit banning certain electronic devices in start and landing .	-2.4498
Last month , Mark Rossiker mentioned the National Transport Safety Board , Safety experts on national transport questions on CBS News , action would still consider the risk .	-4.0953
“ They really are a problem not only because they could cause potential disruption in navigation civil waters , but because we know that the transfer of the air can destroy the transfer from the air . ”	-4.9037
A consultation combination of the industry , which was created by FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government is a broader use of personal electronic devices .	-3.2137
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased restrictions on the use of restrictions .	-2.7566
Critics such as the democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Misouri , believe there is no basis for the ban .	-5.0531
The restrictions have also become increasingly difficult because the use of the devices has become more difficult at present .	-3.0868
In some studies , the speech that relates to one third of passengers is destroyed or ignored by a third of passenger devices .	-3.9593
The FAA began in 1966 to limit electronic devices through flight , after reports on disruption of navigation and communication businesses have been known by passengers UK radios then the latest technique .	-15.4867
New aircraft is far from dependent systems than earlier generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed and authorised by the FAA that they do nothing to make them electronic interferences .	-3.7467
Fairlines have already been passed for some years until the airlines have been achieved .	-3.1181
The food systems adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also unsensitive to interference .	-3.2134
The overwhelming majority of passenger aircraft should be appropriate to the stronger use of electronic devices after the new directives , Huerta .	-2.8774
Today ’ s electronic devices are essentially less functioning than earlier generations .	-1.6340
E-Reader , for example , are only minimum radiation when you explain .	-2.9443
But the transfer values are more stronger in audit or Sands of data .	-3.8309
To defend the defect of the restrictions on devices by passenger is included Amazon.com .	-5.2336
In 2011 , the company employees a passenger aircraft fully children E-reader and then a test to identify problems , but no definition .	-14.6841
Members of the FAA consultation Committee expressed by members of the feeling of devices .	-3.5340
Douglas Kidd from the passenger National Association of Airline Passenger , he believed that he was right to disruption by devices , even though the risk minimized .	-4.0215
Other members of the members said that it is only united reports of pilots , which are very old for the distribution of aircraft systems , and most of them are very old .	-4.7838
The combination of the FAA , however , allows pilots to coordinate instruments under bad conditions the cold of devices by passengers .	-15.9967
A group welcomed the changes and signed it as reasonable adjustment to travel today would be executive with technology .	-3.3971
