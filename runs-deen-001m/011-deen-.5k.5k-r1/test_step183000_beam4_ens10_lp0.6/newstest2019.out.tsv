Welsh agents worry about ' looking Dödel '	-2.7492
There is dismay among some Members of the Assembly about a proposal to change their title on MEPs ( MEPs of the Welsh Parliament ) .	-3.5541

Members of all National Assembly parties have concerns that they could spot themselves .	-3.1267
A Labour MEP said his group ' rims with twp and pwp ' .	-10.3319
Note for the reader : “ twp ” in the Welsh means “ shy ” and “ pwp ” means “ cack ” .	-3.0034
A member of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole is ' not happy ' and has proposed alternatives .	-2.3800
A Welsh Conservative said that his group would be “ open ” for a name change , but pointed out that it is only a short verbal leap to “ Muppet ” by “ MWP ” ( Member of the Welsh Parliament ) .	-3.3104
Note : The Welsh letter W is expressed similar to that of the U in English .	-2.4777
The National Assembly Commission , which is currently working on a draft legislation on name changes , said : ‘ The final decision on the name of the members of the National Assembly is , of course , with the Members themselves . ’	-3.7203
With the Government of Wales Act 2017 , the Welsh Parliament was given the opportunity to change its name .	-2.1976
In June last year , the Commission published the results of a public consultation on the proposals that the name change in the Welsh Parliament receives broad support .	-3.7418
On the question of the members ' title , the Commission preferred Welsh parliamentarians or WMPs , but the MEP option received most support in a public survey .	-4.0377
Members of the Welsh Parliament obviously propose alternative options , but the fight to reach a consensus could prepare headaches to the chairman , Elin JONES , and she is expected to present a draft legislation on these amendments in the coming weeks .	-11.1648
Legislation on reforms will involve amendments to the functioning of the Assembly , including the rules on the disqualification of members of the Welsh Parliament and the shaping of the committee system .	-3.3567

On Sunday , the electorate voted on the amendment of the name to “ Northern Macedonia . ”	-2.9817
The referendum is held to resolve a decade-long dispute with neighbouring Greece , in which a province is called Macedonia .	-2.7666
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to his request for reception for the EU and NATO .	-3.3653
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on name change , has said that he will ignore the vote .	-2.2699
However , the advocates of the referendum , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the name change is simply the price paid for accession to the EU and NATO .	-3.0651
The bells of St. Martin silenced , as churches have problems in Harlem	-3.6274
" Historically , the old people with whom I spoke said that there was a bar and a church every corner , " said Mr Adams .	-3.0356
" There is no or no such thing . '	-9.5884
He said that the disappearance of pubs is understandable .	-1.2485
" People combine comtacts in a different way , " he said today .	-2.8941
'Bricks are no longer a living room in the neighbourhood where you meet regularly ' .	-3.0335
With regard to churches , he fears that the money from selling assets will not have as long as the leaders expect .	-3.0358
Churches could be replaced by multifamily houses with property apartments filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining refuge sites of the district .	-3.3283
The overwhelming majority of people who buy ownership homes in these buildings will be aware , " he said , " and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are closed completely , because it is unlikely that most of those people who draw into these ownership homes will become members of these churches ' .	-10.1430
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became the black metropolis in 1870 – Metropolitan community , St. Martin 's a decade later .	-2.6374
The original white methodological community drew out in the 1930 ’ s .	-2.7285
A black municipality near a religion acquired the building .	-3.0858
St. Martin 's was taken over by a black municipality under the parish John Howard Johnson , who led a boycott of retailers on the 125th street , a main street for shopping in Harlem , which resisted the attitude or promotion of black people .	-4.4260
A fire in 1939 left the building seriously damaged , but when the community members of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction , they commissioned the bell game .	-3.7016
Prime Minister David Johnson , son of father Johnson and successor in St. Martin 's , called the bell game proudly " the bells of the poor . "	-10.1207
The expert who played the bell game in July called it another : ' A cultural treasure ' and ' an irreplaceable historical instrument ' .	-2.8683
The expert , Tiffany Ng of the University of Michigan , also found that it was the world ’ s first bell game played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who changed to the larger bell game at the Riverside Church 18 years ago .	-3.5130
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-1.5737
What has happened in the last few months at St. Martin was a complicated history of architects and builders , some were tabled by the church 's layers , others by the bishops diocese .	-4.5410
The sacristy – the management body of the parish , composed of lay leaders – wrote in July to the diocese concerning that the diocese would " try to pass the costs on to the sacristy " , despite the fact that the sacristy was not involved in the commission of the architects and contractors of the diocese .	-5.2696
Some community members lamented a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese .	-2.5458

I have been bitten !	-1.3791
His entire key leg was torn up , Hammel said he found this when he came to the boy .	-3.9508

Sainsbury plans to conquer the British Beauty Market	-1.7889
Sainsbury 's takes over boats , superdrug and Debenhams with shelves with beauty products in department style occupied with specialist assistants .	-3.9237
Within the framework of an extensive push in the British beauty market in Great Britain , which is growing and worth <unk> 2.8bn , fashion and homeware sales will fall back .	-4.1918
The idea of investing in the beauty market has resulted from the fact that supermarkets seek ways to use the shelf place used earlier for television , microwaves and household goods for new products .	-4.0876
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products is doubled to 3000 products by including , for the first time , brands such as Revlon , Essie , Tweezerman and Dr. PawPaw in the product portfolio .	-3.4541
Existing assortments of L 'Oreal , Maybelline and Burt 's Bees will also receive more space in brands similar to those found in shops such as bo.	-10.0030
The supermarket chain also revives its in-house makeup brand “ Boutique ” , which has many popular vegan products for young buyers .	-3.9134
Furthermore , the perfumer trader Fragrance Shop is testing concessions in two Sainsbury stores , which opened the first week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year opened in Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-3.9013
Online shopping and a shift towards daily shopping of small quantities of food in neighbourhood shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to visit people .	-3.2343
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , has said that the sales offices will look increasingly like houses of goods , because the supermarket chain tries to fight discounts like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-3.9932
Sainsbury 's placed Argos-Outlets in hundreds of shops and also introduced a series of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , allegedly strengthening food sales and making acquisitions more profitable .	-3.4011
The previous attempt by the supermarket to revise its beauty and pharmacy departments ended with a failure .	-2.1082
Sainsbury tested a joint venture with boats in the early 2000 ’ s , but it ended unmistakeable , and revenues from the pharmacies ’ shops could not be shared .	-3.9163
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold its 281 branch pharmacy business three years ago for 125 million pounds to Celesio , the owner of the Lloyds Pharmacy chain .	-2.5226
According to the indications , Lloyds should also be involved , with the aim of expanding wide ranwings of luluxskin care produc. within floyloyds wi.	-18.5565
Paul Mills Hicks , chairman of Sainsbury , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our shelves for beauty products to improve the equipment for our customers .	-3.2067

No one could believe what happened on Tuesday – so shortly before the start .	-2.2712
“ At Marlow HQ there is a warehouse full of goods that can be sold . ”	-2.4059
Experts believe that the passage of the " This Morning " moderator , which is one of the most banking stars in the United Kingdom , could cost millions because they have invested very strongly in products such as pillows , candles , clothing and homewear , and because of the potential for further delays in the market .	-11.3276
And it could mean the end of a long friendship .	-1.3714
For ten years Willoughby and his husband , Dan Baldwin , Jones and his wife Tara Capp have been close .	-7.2672

Instead , he said , the US is continuing sanctions to maintain pressure .	-2.9733
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech on demonstration .	-2.4339
“ We are making good progress with North Korea , ” he said .	-1.4422
“ We wanted to wage war with North Korea .	-1.2574
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.8846
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-1.4673
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have brought positive results , such as the end of missile tests , the liberation of hostages , and the transfer of American soldiers ’ mortal remains home .	-3.1070
And he defended his unusual action when he talked about relations with Kim .	-1.8873
" It is so easy to be president , but instead of having 10,000 people outside who try to come to this full-packed arena , about 200 people would stand there exactly there , " said Trump and pointed to the quantity directly before him .	-4.7247
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake killed hundreds and devastate an island .	-1.7424
Following the earthquake in Lombok , for example , foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they would not be needed .	-1.9360

While Save the Children compile a team to travel to Palu , it is not certain whether foreign staff can work on site .	-3.6368
The spokesman of the national civil protection agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would evaluate the situation in Palu to see whether international organisations can contribute to aid .	-2.7849
Unfortunately , given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly suffering , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-3.1977
While the tsunami protection rooms in Aceh were built , which is not common for other coastlines .	-12.0753
The obvious absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu , although a warning has already been in force , is likely to have contributed to the loss of lihlililililili.	-5.2501
Even under favourable conditions , travelling between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult .	-1.9344
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .	-1.0537

US Should Double Artificial Intelligence Expenditure	-1.4972
While China becomes more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investments , says Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI practitioner who worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.1969
These demands were made after US government members made announcements to AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.4419
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-2.4804
“ Doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is on the verge , ” said Lee .	-3.3209
Doubling funding could double the chances of achieving the next Artificial Intelligence achievement in the US , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.1352
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the new World Order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI companies , Face + + .	-2.8918
In the 1980 ’ s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the high-level American Othello player , later he was leader at Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s Chinese branch .	-4.5635
Lee recognized the US government ’ s previous technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Research Agency ) , and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-3.6328
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain government subsidies , ” said Lee .	-2.5370
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but companies , ” said Lee .	-2.6388
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have ceased to work on AI in recent years .	-2.9807
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-2.3715
“ I think Green Cards should automatically be offered doctoral languages in AI , ” he said .	-3.1490
In July 2017 , the Chinese Council presented its development plan for artificial intelligence of the next generation ( Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan ) .	-2.4048

Macedonia is voting in a referendum on whether to change the name of the country .	-2.2800
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name to the Republic of Northern Macedonia , a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece blocking its accession offers to the European Union and NATO .	-10.5253
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim to the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.1286
In June , the two governments concluded an agreement based on the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-14.1236
President Gjorge Ivanov said he will not vote in the referendum , and there is doubt as to whether the result will create the 50 % barrier , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-3.7061
The question on the referendum ballot was : ' Are you for NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.2823
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that the price is worth carrying on with institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries that is to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.4661
“ I have come today to vote on the country ’ s future ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia so that they can live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life of greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgievska , 79 , in Skopje .	-10.2031
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote , so that it becomes crucial .	-3.1419
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for the name change .	-2.2066
The Committee on National Elections said against 13 p.m. that no reports were made about irregularities .	-4.3657
But the turnout was only 16 % – in the last parliamentary elections in 2016 , the value was 34 % at the same time , and at the end , 66 % of registered voters had cast their vote .	-17.5420
“ I went for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.5408
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son , Dushko , voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country , which would pave him the way for accession to NATO and to the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.1456
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs in front of the tents drawn up by those who are boycotting the referendum .	-2.9966
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads upwards , not through the service door , " said Kavadarkov .	-2.9938
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.7034
If you do not want to accept us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.8200
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of over 20 % .	-9.7430
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour of this , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev said after the levy of his vote .	-3.5333
According to him , the outcome of ‘ yes ’ would be a ‘ strengthening our future ’ .	-2.9099
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore be involved in the vote – less than necessary .	-2.7378
Another survey carried out by Macedonia 's Telma TV found that 57 % of the respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.5644
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said ‘ yes ’ .	-3.1415
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout is more than 50 % .	-2.3979
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year .	-2.4221

Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling carried out Brighton ’ s defense at the Manchester City-2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , Englan.	-3.4739
Aguero looked incredibly simple in the 65th minute .	-2.5728
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentinian storm received a passport in the middle field .	-2.7567
He tricked three defenders from Brighton to play free .	-1.9993
Then Agüero saw itself surrounded by three green shirts .	-2.1150
He handled a defender before running several players on the edge of the Brighton penalty space .	-3.6408
Then he made a passport to the left and left to Sterling .	-9.2748
The English stormer used his first contact to play back the ball to Aguero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton goal Mathew Ryan into the right side of the gate .	-3.9796
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City Manager Pep Guardiola the reporters .	-1.9544
“ We talked about this ; he played 55.60 minutes .	-2.4208

Joker Wants to Play Gamblers Against Rockies	-3.0220
Since the national players were excluded from the playoff competition , there was not much reason to force a further start .	-3.0932
But the hard-contested joker hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for the rockies that have a lead in front of the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-9.9034
The rockies secured a 5 : 2 victory over the nationals on Friday evening at least one place lead , but the title profit in the first league is still not safe .	-4.3226
" Even if we play for free , we can at least stuff , because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best that this year has to offer us .	-3.9147
Why should I not make an effort here ? '	-2.5033
The nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are allegedly inclined to throw joke in such a situation .	-3.0917

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.5783
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.9051
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.0912
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour Members who say that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-3.1412
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , has been treated similarly because she has resolutely opposed anti-Semitism .	-2.7867

The East Labour communication in Nottingham meeting on Friday says : ' We want meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-11.7875
Most of my time as a local Labour MEP in the eight years was the same as the GC meetings on Friday evening .	-2.8111
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , more softer ' policy has long been forgotten , if it ever began .	-3.7057
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated and every opinion is assessed as to whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-3.2490
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s takeover , because colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected to take a turning point and take positions that I would never have agreed with , whether in relation to national security or the internal market .	-13.0423
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – follows a tirade of abuse in the social media calling for election , denouncing the centre ’ s policy and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-3.6745
This is not just my experience .	-2.3319
I do know , in fact , that more luck than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political .	-3.4870
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are subjected to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never shy .	-3.3481
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the extent of abuse has normalized .	-2.0579
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.6336
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with any motion of censure or change of selection , the party is becoming smaller .	-3.6300
Over the last two years , I have received a lot of advice to collect my neck , not to be so loud , and then I would be ‘ right ’ .	-4.3530
For this reason , however , I have not come into policy .	-2.6352
Thirty-two years ago , as a student , I joined Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , which led to my classroom collapsing literally , and as a result I tried to work for better public services for those who need it most , whether as a local council or minister .	-5.0858
I have never hidden my political views , even at the last election .	-2.4108
As far as my political positions are concerned , no one in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-3.1733
For those who supported the motion on Friday , I just want to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy in order to stay loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country is driving towards Brexit , which is harming households , businesses and our public services .	-4.6335
But the only message I have is not going to Nottingham momentum , but to my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that no threats to select or political opportunities will prevent me from working in what I believe is the best interest of you all .	-3.8521

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Unbeaten at the Lead	-2.2350
Two late Tries may have distorted the final result somewhat , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully entertaining tennent 's Premiership Match of the day .	-2.6968
They now perform the table as the only unbeaten of the ten teams .	-2.4524
At the end of the day it was due to the outstanding defense of the host , but also to the fact that opportunities were better used .	-4.7550
" We were tested so far through our games and we are still unbeaten , so I must be happy , " he said .	-2.4659
Robyn Christie von Melrose said , “ Thanks to Ayr , they used their chances better . ”	-2.4693
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to let numbers speak , and Jason Baggot a untransformed attempt .	-4.4802
Climo presided over the leadership of Ayr with a penalty before he reached a match directly at the half-time and then made a solo attempt to make him lead the 17 : 5 pause for Ayr .	-6.2319
But Melrose began the second half well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt , transformed by Baggot , reduced the backward to five points .	-3.5748
There was a longer interruption due to the serious injury of Ruaridh Knott , who left the playing field on a wearing side .	-22.7890
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card , and Melrose again paid the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt , at the end of a curse of heavy pressure .	-3.6026
However , the home page came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because of a tackling without Climo 's penalty limit , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr in the back .	-4.3152
Climo converted , as almost after restarting , after Kyle Rowe David Armstrongs boxkick began and sent the wing storm Gregor Henry by pass towards Try number five .	-3.5037

These hopes may have been at its peak for decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Criminal Court on 1 October after five years of deliberations .	-3.7558
" Bolivia has the momentum , the spirit of unity and calmness , and naturally expects the result , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.2517
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens across the country and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will favour Bolivia ’ s claim that , after decades of troubled talks , Chile must negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-4.3092
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – who is facing a controversial struggle for re-election next year – much depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-3.0781
“ We are on the verge of gaining access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.3517
However , some analysts find it unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision will not change Bolivia .	-3.4344
The Dutch UN institution has no power to award Chilean territory and has stipulated that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-2.7706
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after the hearing of the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-3.5991
And far from driving Bolivia ’ s cause forward , the last four years could have resigned it .	-3.6980
“ The question of marine access is used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes , ” said Zárate .	-2.1819
Moral warrior rhetoric has destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , she proposed .	-2.4797

His comments come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume the diplomatic talks on ice on nuclear disarmament three months after the meeting with North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in Singapore .	-3.0185

John Edward : Language skills that are essential to global citizens	-1.7229
Independent schools in Scotland have a balance of success in academic excellence that continued in 2018 with excellent test results , including individual and group successes in sport , art , music and other Community enterprises .	-4.4225
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , are striving to offer their students and parents the best service level .	-2.9215

However , the main objective of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans , who face a decisive election in November .	-3.3064
According to Reuters , the objective of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-2.6285
“ The majority in Congress is first on the presidential agenda , so he visited as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent election campaign , ” a spokesman of the Trump campaign , who does not want to be called , Reuters told .	-4.7836

Ryder Cup 2018 : The US Team is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday singles	-12.0848
After three unilateral encounters , four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.7055
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions such as this . .	-10.9105
So where would they say the momentum is now ?	-1.4744
“ They had a six-point lead , and now it is four , so there is probably a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew for the day . ”	-3.7800
Europe is , of course , in the advantage of 4 points , and twelve more are still to be played .	-3.7185
Americans , as Spieth says , feel somewhat windy in their sails , and there was much encouraging for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and have three of four points each .	-3.6864
Spieth was considering from the outset and progressed with a good example .	-3.2053
These cheerful cries were louder when his round came forward , he pocketed a decisive putt in play 4 to reach a decision after he and Thomas resigned 2 points after 2 games .	-5.5889
His pleasure about the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was such that one thought he was still believing in the American victory .	-3.9810
“ You really have to concentrate strongly and worry about your own game , ” said Spieth .	-10.1590
This is all that each player still remains .	-3.2429
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.2627
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.6555
Europe ’ s strange but admirable couple plays flaweless and simply makes everything right .	-3.4784
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not achieve a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoid the rear nine on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-3.6664
This course and the way in which its energy appears to flow towards and from this outstanding quantity of spectators makes it the favorites on Sunday and when the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player sealing a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-4.8255
Probably both are simultaneously on different holes .	-2.5442
Talking now about a European victory would be too premature .	-2.1874
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made short process with Sergio Garcia , who victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.3710
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine of the Spaniards and the Swede turn into a hole from which they never came out again .	-4.0728
On Sunday , however , no one will help you out of your hole .	-2.8003
Because of the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way in which a strategy can change in the hand turn , it is very fascinating to watch fourballs and foursomes close by .	-4.8165
Europe , as a team , has played better and taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the team of the US has the pleasure of fighting , which some , particularly statesides , have doubted .	-5.0116
Europe Leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day	-2.3023
Europe will take advantage of a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-3.7231
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its previous balance to four points in Le Golf National .	-3.6114
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who came to preserve the trophy that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team fighting with Austrians in the morning , and won the series with 3-1 .	-4.9430
The US offered more resistance in the fours and won two games , but they could not digest the deficit .	-2.0274
Jim Furyk ’ s team needs eight points from the 12 individual games from Sunday to keep the trophy .	-2.5790
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row , while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend , are only the second pair that wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.0640
After destroying woods and Patrick Reed in Fourballs , it was confident that they would beat a sober wood and American rookie Bryson Dechambeau by an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-3.9224
Woods , who took himself through two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 scores in four balls and fours and seven in a row .	-4.4446
Justin Rose , rested for the morning fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in Foursomes and beaten in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – one and spspspace in in .	-12.9316
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-1.9121
The three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday .	-2.6572
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in Viererpack , and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in four packs after they lost the first two holes .	-3.7041
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team returns from a four points deficit to the singles , even though Halter Furyk 's site needs only one indecision to keep the trophy .	-4.1775
After two days of second best , however , a Sunday account looks like it would go beyond it .	-3.2950
North Korea says that “ no one ” will have unilateral disarmament without trust .	-2.7612
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that , under such circumstances , the country would unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.9375
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual general assembly of the world 's body that North Korea last year had taken " significant goodwill measures " , such as atomic and missile tests , the reduction of the nuclear area and the commitment not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-5.4924
" However , there is no corresponding response from the USA , " he said .	-2.6583
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances , there is no way that we will first disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-3.4147
While Ri revived the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , where North Korea would gradually be rewarded with gradual steps , his declaration seemed important , inasmuch as it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-3.9034
Ri pointed out a joint declaration by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US President-in-Office and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to working towards ' denuclearizing the Korean peninsula ' , while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-3.3091
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korea War in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must abandon its nuclear weapons first .	-2.4263
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.3497
The US insists on " denuclearization first " ( first denuclearization ) and increase pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a mandatory way , and even reject the " statement of the end of the war " , said Ri .	-3.7353
" The perception that sanctions can force us into the knees is a dream of people who are ignorant to us .	-2.5783
But the problem is that continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust . ”	-2.1573
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week .	-2.7601
Instead , the Minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months and added : ' If the party were to denuclearize South Korea and not the US , the denuclearization of the Korean peninsula would not enter such an impasse ' .	-4.0266
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year , when he reported it to the U.N. , and the General Assembly that targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called “ rocket mann ” on a suicide mission .	-10.1356
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ destroy North Korea , ” commended Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.7681
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no timeframe for this and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-3.1702
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council Pyongyang should reward the steps taken .	-1.8316
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN , Security Council on Thursday that ' enforcing the sanctions of the Security Council must be vigorously and without defect continued until we realize full , final and verified denuclearization ' .	-4.5379
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent the funding of Pyongyang ’ s nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-2.5395
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and subsequently said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.0639
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last journey was not go.	-7.3895
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress was made ; only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him to “ make similar demands . ”	-3.4163
North Korea promised at a meeting with Moon this month to dismantle a missile location and also a nuclear complex when the United States adopts ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.4093
He said that Kim told him that the ' corresponding measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump had promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.5262
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-1.9237
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the caffein-housed " through nights " .	-12.8847
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspicious when it comes to helping themselves , even if it is a matter of very simple mechanisms .	-3.6729
Charles Czeisler , professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course , which in his opinion is the first of his kind in the USA .	-3.3000
He was inspired to start the course after he had given a talk about the effects of deficiency on learning .	-3.3257
At the end , a girl came to me and said : ' Why are I only told this now , in my final year ?	-3.7578
She said that you have never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , ” he told the telegraph .	-11.3331
The course offered this year for the first time explains to students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-3.0909
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University 's Health Service , said that the University decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-3.8642
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.0387
In a section there is an image of a sleeping hall where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance affects a deficiency and the importance of a sleeping routine .	-4.3499
Another section explains to participants how long-term sleep departure can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression and cancer .	-3.1811
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect on their everyday lives .	-10.2174
We know that it will not immediately change the behaviour of students .	-1.6799
" But we believe that they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health impact of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Czeisler added .	-2.9912
The culture of pride exists “ night ” , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students make sleep withdrawal a growing problem .	-3.8229
Having sufficient sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also not to increase , since sleep deprivation places the brain in hunger mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-4.9101
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after he visited one of his classes in his first year in Harvard .	-11.8029
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course .	-2.8168
The next step , hopefully , is to ask all docotrands to complete a similar study programme before entering the competition university .	-3.3044
Prof. Czeisler recommended the students to set an alarm when they should go to bed and wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of blue light , broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circadian rhythm to the clock , leading to problems when sleeping .	-5.2925
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal is Gerrard ’ s Men	-2.1920
Further external problems of the Rangers : After a meeting of Dolly Menga , Livingston came to the 1-to-0 defeat for the dissolute team of Steven Gerrard .	-4.8965
The Ibrox team wanted to record its first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in St. Johnstone in February , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as trainer who left his team back eight points behind the disappointed Ladbroke ’ s Premiership chief Hearts .	-11.9903
Menga landed seven minutes before the mid-term a hit and an inspirational rangers list did not look like they could balance it .	-3.9336
While the Rangers now fall back to the sixth place , Livingston climb to three and are behind Hibernian only because of the torture difference .	-4.3716
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , as Calum Spence line judge had to provide a headwound after he was hit by a litter object – apparently thrown out by the foreign fans sector .	-5.6365
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed to Ayr and swept directly into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-13.4953
By contrast , the same Livi-Elf , which decreased a point last week ’ s hearts , was likely to have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not allow the opponents to space for action at any time .	-5.4871
The rangers dominated with ball ownership , but Livingston implemented opportunities better .	-3.2562
They should have met after only two minutes when Menga 's first depositor Scott Pittman sent towards Allan McGregors Tor , but the midfield player broke his great change at the gate .	-4.9865
A deep free of Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far behind posts .	-3.5765
The rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than consumption in their own game , in the last third . there ! !	-11.7365
Alfredo Morelos was quite clear after the first quarter of an hour , after clashing a penalty after he and Steven Lawless , but referee Steven Thomson did not address the Colombian appeal .	-4.8512
The Rangers reached only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly a jump from Lassana Coulibaly and the meeting of an unprecedented Ovie Ejaria .	-4.4918
Even if Livi ’ s opening match might have been opposed to the game ’ s progress in the 34th minute , nobody can deny that they deserve it alone .	-4.6428
Again the rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-11.5368
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the calm and picked Menga for a simple finish .	-3.0708
Gerrard acted during the break when he swapped Coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ranked from his line to block .	-12.1773
But Livingston repeatedly moved the guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and necklace swept long balls after long balls .	-4.2911
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up to deny Jacobs before Lithgow headed out of the corner .	-3.8188
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another late claim to a penalty because he had prevented himself with Jacobs , but again he saw Thomson away .	-3.8724

And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger was born in Germany .	-3.2145
Geiger developed a method of recognizing and trade fairs of radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as the Geiger counter .	-3.9936
Since then , the Geiger counter has also become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , the seemingly unlikely cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans attached :	-4.2189
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-1.7572
Rogers : “ It is a violin counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.1781
When you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-2.7419
Evans : “ Tell me , now it cracks huge ! ”	-3.1294
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.5668
But the invention that carries its name is still used .	-2.4221

A study vaccine shows promising results for patients with a number of types of cancer .	-2.2623
A woman treated with the vaccine teaching the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw her egg cancer disappearing for more than 18 months .	-2.4950
The method consists of extracting immune cells from a patient , changing them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs on many types of cancer , and then reinjecting cells .	-3.5295
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine ' .	-2.1388
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer , ” including breast , egg stock , lung and intestinal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.1229
A similar approach to taking patients from immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-2.6330

The data of the three senators were published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-1.8679
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the posts was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of an employee of Waters reports H.	-10.9244
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continues .	-2.5114
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the fact that this information was elected .	-3.9249
This unsustainable claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.8050
Water ’ s statement quickly led to criticism online , including the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-2.9695
“ The fact that the matter is denied is extremely annoying ” wrote meat .	-2.6943
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a member of the Congress .	-3.1594
If someone is accused of having done something , he cannot be evil .	-9.8615
They must not be violent .	-11.2333
You must not question the plaintiff 's motives .	-2.0422
You must be calm and left ” .	-2.1896
Meat seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the criticism of the Democrats to judge Kavanaugh , who was accused of being critics of seeming too angry during the hearing on Thursday .	-12.5853
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who candidates in the midterm elections next to the seated Water , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-3.5963

Review of ' Johnny English – You only live three times ' – poorly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-2.5105
It is tradition to seek suggestions in every new film with British tendency for Brexit , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action Comedy Spoof franchise .	-16.1269
Is the ironic self-satire over the abyss of humanity the new export possibility of the nation ?	-3.1935
In any case , the glottery , rubber and incompetent Johnny English has received the license to remassage things .	-4.4379
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims for Smoothie-Glamour , received a syringe Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy , contributing a single note to the leading melody of fire brigades at the opening ceremony of the London Olympic Games in 2012 .	-5.4510
It is also based on travellers and international , mysterious Atkinson , who has once been involved in the forgotten Barclaycard TV displays , always leaving chaos .	-11.0209
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.6886
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and beats the main rotor shortly against his hhelhelm .	-4.8107
Atkinson 's body comedy talent is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially since the " serious " film brands such as 007 and mission Impossible offer comedy as an ingredient .	-3.8340
The humor feels like he is more addressed to children than adults , and for me the crazy abuses of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean silent films .	-10.8327
The permanent premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.8418
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the highly secret British network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to horrify the serving agent – a regrettably small role for Kevin Eldon .	-10.8962
It is the last straw half for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and contested personality and is already suffering a complete melt of political unpopularity . her bewith this quasTTeresmmay her figureheart , but there is not a loin the scmble .	-15.5947
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , since every single active spy has been compromised , they must bring someone out of retirement .	-3.7544
And that means that the great Johnny English , who is now employed as a school master in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy about spying .	-4.6671
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunified with his former , long-suffering Kumpel Bough , played again by Ben Miller .	-3.6596
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overwhelming , burschikose role in which Vicki Pepperdine does not completely apply .	-4.3288
So the Batman and Robin des Chaos at the Secret Service of her Majesty are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.3291
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is coming dangerously into the ban of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to solve the UK ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.5666
English and Bough begin their odyssey of colorful highjinks : When waiters , they inflame a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Volta ’ s luxury yacht ; and English triggers anarchy when he tries to familiarise himself with a Virtual Reality Headset with the inner of Volta ’ s house .	-5.2464
For this last sequence , all the registers have certainly been drawn , but as delightful and left out , the whole thing is reminiscent of child television .	-4.8191
Rather moderate .	-1.9026
And , as with the other Johnny English films , I could not avoid thinking : can British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really fulfils his talent ?	-3.8494
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britons for a four-day week payment for five days .	-3.3681
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan , with Britain working only four days a week , but paid for five .	-3.1204
According to reports , the Party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the revolution of artificial intelligence ( CI ) to workers by releasing them an additional day .	-3.4439
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money back home .	-2.2761
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plan to tip the country to the benefit of workers .	-4.0573
The Trade Union Congress has approved the change to a four-day week period as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-3.5662
A high-level source of the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.6118
A four-day week is an objective that agrees with the Party ’ s approach to restoring the economic balance for the benefit of workers and the general industrial strategy of the party , but this objective will not be realised overnight .	-4.3941
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign .	-2.3669
However , this advance is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party .	-2.5947
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.6571
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to specify his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.0628
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit makers ' among utilities .	-2.5501
The Shadow Chancellor 's plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not recover their entire share , because a Labour government could carry out ' deductions ' due to alleged misconduct .	-4.8052
He also confirmed workers ' plans to appoint management and create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of the private sector 's equity capital to employees who receive annual dividends of up to 500 pounds .	-4.1079
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy speak in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their minds	-2.6797
Due to an ongoing FBI investigation into accusations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on the appointment of the Supreme Court judge was postponed by at least one week , and the question is raised as to whether the investigation results of the FBI could encourage Republican Senators to abandon their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.0785
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , the correspondent of “ 60 minutes ” , the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could move them to change their minds .	-3.6151
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.5259
“ Anyway , ” Kennedy said .	-1.6982
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke with judge Kavanaugh .	-1.8316
I called him after that happened after that claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.2711
It was determined , targeted , unambiguous . '	-2.0187
Graham 's voice , however , seemed to be crazy in stone .	-3.2591
" I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb accusation , " he said .	-2.1676
“ Dr. Ford , I do not know what happened , but I know that Brett has strongly disputed the accusation , ” added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-3.5267
" No one who called it could confirm it .	-2.2710

" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-2.0078
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.2794
This year 's seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-3.9642
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project , an international stakeholder aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-2.7255
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , the concert visitors had a whole range of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteering , e-mail to a world leader , a telephone or another sensible way of increasing the goal of combating poverty and increasing awareness of it .	-5.0687
But how successful has Global Citizen been to achieve its goal with 12 remaining years ?	-2.5967
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way of convincing people to demand a call for action , or simply another case of so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel sending a tweet through signing an online petition or an online application as if they make a real difference ?	-4.0437
Global Citizen says that , since 2011 , more than 19 million “ actions ” have been recorded by his supporters , pushing for a variety of different targets .	-3.6200
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-2.9133
In early 2018 , the Group referred to 390 operations and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid or financed .	-3.5369
The group estimates that the funds allocated so far have had a direct influence on nearly 649 million people around the world .	-8.8433
The most important commitments include The Power of Nutrition , a British-based partnership between investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization promised to help Rwanda at $ 35 million to end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens received more than 4,700 tweets .	-4.4496
“ With support from the British Government , donors , other governments , and global citizens like you , we can make sure that the social injustice of malnutrition is one day ’ s history , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the quantity of human beings in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-3.6416
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom aimed at improving the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will reach the financing of the Power of Nutrition project 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-3.6739
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on your site : “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.4405
Global citizens said : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.5009
Like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-2.4076
Stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be present at this year 's event in New York , which is moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-2.9684
US could build a “ blockade ” by Navy to hinder Russian energy exports – Home Secretary	-2.8551
Washington can resort to his navy to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of the Interior , Ryan Zinke , is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-3.0662
Zinke said that Russia ’ s commitment to Syria – especially in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.1332
“ I believe the reason why they are in the Middle East is the following : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.7501
And , according to the officials , there are ways and means to deal with it .	-2.7011
“ The United States has this ability to ensure with our navy that maritime paths are open and , if necessary , block them to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , ” he said .	-3.9254
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that describes itself as the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.0625
He compared Washington ’ s approach to Russia and Iran , and said that they are actually the same .	-2.6379
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less about using and replacing fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-2.9209
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquid natural gas to Europe and replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-3.0706
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to push Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ prisoners . ”	-3.2979
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the 11 billion dollar pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-2.8322
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-1.8122
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose the suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow .	-8.5557
The US ’ s position has backlashed Germany ’ s commitment to the project	-3.2087
Germany ’ s leading industrial organisation , the Bundesverband Deutscher Industrien ( BDI ) , has called on the US to distance itself from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-2.7432
" I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply , " said the Federal Association of German Industry ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-2.5084

However , a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should be running in 2020 .	-2.5598

The Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of state , federal and international law .	-2.5026
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all asylum applications must be assessed in accordance with the realities of the respective action and that such action violates this principle .	-4.2915
Lawyers continued to argue in the correspondence that the policy refusing to admit immigrants damages the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants become entrepreneurs and “ do necessary work . ”	-3.9876
Jeff Sessions General Prosecutor relied on immigration judges in June to no longer grant asylum to people fleeing domestic or gang violence .	-3.0950
“ Asylum is entitled to those people who have to leave their country for persecution because of race , religion , nationality or membership to a particular social group or because of political opinion , ” said Sessions in his statement on the law on 11 June .	-4.5382

US Ambassador charges China with “ propaganda advertising . ”	-2.3158
A week after an official Chinese newspaper placed a four-page display in an American daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of US China trade , the US ambassador in China Beijing indicated that the US press was using propaganda .	-4.1148
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid insertion of China Daily in the Des Moines Register - the state with the most sold newspaper in Iova - after accusing China of interfering in the US Congressional elections of 6 November , which denies China .	-4.3232
US officials claim to Reuter that Trump ’ s accusation of interfering in the US elections was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-2.5899
While it is normal for foreign states to switch advertisements to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariff on imports .	-3.4874
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs should , according to China ’ s and US experts , hit US states exporters like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party lilive . peopped many peopped peop.	-14.5285
Terry Branstad , US ambassador to China and former Iowa governor , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said Beijing had violated American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.1735
China , wrote Branstad in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ now operates this mobbing strongly through propaganda ads in our own free press .	-4.0470
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government makes use of the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and press ” , Branstad wrote .	-3.8440
" By contrast , you will find limited differences at the newspaper level in the streets of Beijing and see no real reproduction of different opinions that the Chinese people could have on China ’ s worrying economic development , given that the media are firmly under the grip of the Communist Party of China , " he wrote .	-11.6718
He added that ' one of the most prominent newspapers in China contradicted the publication offer ' , although he did not say what newspaper .	-3.1443
Republicans bury voters before the Midterm elections with the Kavanaugh Debacle , warn analysts	-3.3376
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee that is elected to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assaults , warning that in the forthcoming elections they will see a counter-strike , particularly of women .	-4.2379
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already stated that they want to vote for him .	-2.2242
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reeher , professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-9.7196
Reeher said that he doubts that support at the last minute of Jeff Flake ( Republican MEP for the State of Arizona ) is sufficient for FBI investigations to reconcile anvvoters .	-4.3213
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor will they be in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior adviser and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-8.0687
On Friday morning , the demonstrators sung : “ The November comes ! ” while demonstrating in the Senate corridor , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination , despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , reported Mic .	-4.1652
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalists .	-1.5718
“ People say that it is quite advanced , that is true .	-2.9368
But the number could be higher , especially among suburbs and younger voters , 18-29 year-olds who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-3.2880
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she carried out her accusations of sexual violence against the candidate for the Supreme Court , analysts said that a backlash could follow if Republicans advance the candidacy .	-3.8671
“ This has become a confusing chaos for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , early last week , according to NBC News .	-2.5141
“ It is not simply about the committee election or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is being placed on the substitute bank , but about how the Republicans handled this and how they treated it , ” shared Guy Cecil , Director of the US Priorities , a group that helps the Democrats election , with the news station .	-5.0077
However , the Americans are divided over what Ford and Kavanaugh said .	-2.4734

The San Jose plan included 13 fights , including six main struggles and was shown live in the night in the UK on Channel 5 .	-4.2385

“ But it is 6 a.m. on a Sunday there and we will not be able to fix it until Sunday of our time , Monday of their time .	-9.0071
But we are working on this .	-1.4247
Believe me when it was switched , a lot was written and the contents were not friendly .	-3.1296
We tried to repair it , we thought it would be a technical error .	-1.8301
But it was not , it was a government problem .	-1.9405
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-1.5337
We will reduce it to five rather than six fights - as we usually do - and we have tried to exceed the fans and have simply gone beyond .	-3.6315
It is an unfavourable situation ' .	-1.6672

The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling that he was subjected to everyone because of his sexuality , but that gave him the motivation to be a success .	-3.8374
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware at the secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-2.8491
In the first issue of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 , he said by Lauren Laverne that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give others “ hope . ”	-2.6779
He also said that a victory at the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important for him .	-2.1059
The regular presentative of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has freed himself several months due to a dise.	-12.8252
Daley arrived in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt “ worth less ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-3.5292
He said , “ To this day , I have given the power and strength to these feelings of less value being and the otherwise , I needed you to succeed . ”	-4.8335

The Bank ’ s Weak Mickelson Sat on Ryder Cup Saturday	-3.1321
American Phil Mickelson will set up a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he drastically needs to improve his form drastically , wing a smlesmilm.	-12.7531
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-2.8086
Instead , as so often happens for the US , the five-fold Major winner shared his day between fire and exercise rounds in the golf course , in the hope of overcoming his deep .	-4.5023
The 48-year-old is never the straightest driver himself at the height of his career and is not suitable for the tight Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-3.9260
And as if the place alone were not already challenging enough , Mickelson meets the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-10.9272
If Americans are lagging behind four points when they start the 12 games and have a hot start , Mickelson ’ s match could be absolutely crucial .	-3.7657
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband ; something else left him .	-2.8510
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a flap on the back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.2825
“ He has a lot of confidence .	-2.0972
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-1.9303
I probably would not have thought he would play two games .	-8.0463
I wanted more , but it has now arisen and that is the way in which we thought we had to tackle it .	-4.9003
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-2.1404
Until now , Nick Faldo has kept the record over most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which will bMMicbre!	-12.8110
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career , which has never matched the heights of its individual record .	-3.1857
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times undecided , but Furyk said his presence would have been invaluable for the team .	-4.0203
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to maintain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-2.9564
I think the younger players had fun this week to measure with him , that was nice to look at . ”	-3.4109
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.1507
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.1766
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the last day ’ s games can quickly become an uncomfortable ride at the Ryder Cup .	-3.9380
In 1997 , the Dane debuted in the game in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only scarcely over the target line and won a thin advance of 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-4.9767
" We remember that you were in the lead in Valderrama ; we had a major lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in V, we won only scarc, " , Bjorb s, after leadwinbacin the Clasof 20.	-22.1922
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-1.9857
You will be bored tomorrow .	-1.8381
Go out and go things right .	-9.2043
It is only over when the points are displayed on the table .	-2.8784
Our goal is to win this cup and we focus on it .	-3.2470
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.6395
Enthusiastically , as his players played in a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be premature .	-3.7972
Tomorrow is another day .	-1.5680
Tomorrow the personal appearances are coming , and that is another thing .	-2.7858
It 's great to be outside with a partner if things go well , but if you are out there alone , then your own skills as golfers will be tested to the whole .	-5.4927
That is the message you need to convey to the players : to get the best out of it tomorrow .	-3.8637
You are now passing on to your partner and he needs to bring full bet just like you . ”	-5.3904
Unlike Björn , the opposing player Jim Furyk will strive to cut his players individually better than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who obtained three of four points .	-4.3493
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turning at the end of the day , when he was part of the winner team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team carried out the “ miracle of Medinah . ”	-4.6119
“ I remember every damn word , ” he said how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had assembled his players on the way to the last day .	-3.4667
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but we want to get rid of as quickly as possible , as we have seen in Brookline , in Medinah .	-3.1511
For the first time a self-dynamic has developed , the big pressure on the middle matches is exerting .	-3.9475
We have built up our line accordingly and brought the boys out as we felt , you know that we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-4.3571
Thomas , together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , should lead the other European on the top places in the rankings , the counterstrike against Rory McIlroy in the top game .	-3.7392
I put this group of boys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his own selection .	-12.9085
Replacing Germany ’ s New Warship Time	-2.7721
The German navy ’ s latest frigate should have been served by 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War ’ s period , but , according to incorrect systems and escalating costs , local media reports will now take at least until next year .	-5.5544
The start-up of the “ Rheinland Palatinate ” , the manager of the brand new frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , such as the “ Die Zeit ” newspaper , invoking a military speaker .	-4.8885
The navy should have started ships in 2014 , but serious problems after first delivery burdened the ambitious project .	-3.1400
The four frigates of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the navy in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Bremen class .	-3.3445
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of air defense and ship defense missiles and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-3.3812
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigattas can be used for up to two years without calling the port of the h. for .	-12.0137
However , the state-of-the-art warships that Germany is supposed to facilitate overseas power projection will already be outdated by the constant delays if they are finally put in service , as the weekly newspaper “ Die Zeit . ”	-10.6003
The unfortunate F125 frigate caused headlines last year when the German navy officially refused to start the ship and returned it to the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Hamburg .	-3.2236
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a ship builder after the delivery .	-2.5780
The reasons for the return of the ships were little known ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the warship worthless in combat operations .	-10.2762
Software defects were particularly important , since the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are served by an occupation of around 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older frigates of the Bremen class .	-3.9500
Also , it turned out that the ship had a significant overweight , restricting performance and making it difficult to upgrade to the navy .	-4.7758
It is assumed that the 7,000 tonnes of “ Rhineland Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by Germans in World War II .	-13.6633
In addition to incorrect hardware , the price sign of the entire project , including the training of the crew , will also become the subject of .	-4.5965
Instead of the originally estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the cost seems to have reached the dizzying level of EUR 3.1 billion ( about $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.0376
The problems with the latest frigates receive particular significance in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is dwindling .	-3.9470
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , allowed the fleet of war to “ go out of operational vessels . ”	-3.2106
The official said that the problem had grown in the course of time , because old ships were made out of service without any substitute for .	-4.8032
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigattens were put in service by the navy .	-3.3070
The National Trust listens to the secret life of bats .	-1.8894
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands is trying to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-2.8152
It is hoped that this will bring new knowledge of the behaviour of unique flying mammals , which can guide future measures to protect animals .	-3.9736
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by soprano pistrels and brown long-lasting and daubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-4.0283
Special recording devices are placed at the main points of the accommodation to track bats activities throughout the season .	-3.1191
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-1.8019
A professional sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of batch calls and assigns the calls to species .	-3.4600
The habitats card to be created and the relevant report should provide a detailed overview of the ways of behavi.	-4.3307
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) National Trust for Scotland , hopes to find out which areas of life are most important for bats and how they are used by the respective species .	-3.6184
This information will help to identify the advantages of life management , such as meadow education and how the forests for bats and other related species are best preserved .	-3.6605
There has been a sharp decline in bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom over the past hundred years .	-3.5076
They are threatened by construction works that affect their sleepings and the loss of habitat .	-2.7221
Wind power plants and lighting can also pose a risk , as well as flying strips and some chemical treatments of construction materials .	-3.8604
Bats are not really blind .	-2.0253
Adapted to their night hunting activities , the ears are more useful than the eyes when catching them .	-4.0206
They use sophisticated echo location technology to locate errors and obstacles in their flight .	-10.5238
The NTS , which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-11.0010
There are ten trained experts who perform regular surveys , inspect sleepings and sometimes also carry out rescues .	-3.3527
The organization has even established Scotland 's first and only dedicated bats reserve in the thread property in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish bats are home .	-3.6899
According to Manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for the.	-7.5436
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-1.8177
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and the whole good habitat .	-2.2671
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other land helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-2.8678
He emphasises that it is important to check before maintenance work in buildings whether bats are there , according to which it is possible that when intentionally destroying a single sleep of maternal animals kill up to 400 females and boys , a whole local population may be erased .	-5.1299
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disrupt them and destroy their sleepings .	-2.8733
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish staff at Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.7510
She said , “ We still have much to learn about our bats and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.5031
Ronaldo claims rape as lawyers sue the German magazine	-2.7269
Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people want to promote themselves by using his name .	-3.0299
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ The Mirror ” , which published the accusations .	-2.7039
In 2009 , he raped an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas .	-2.6494
He was then supposed to have paid $ 375,000 to keep silent about the incident , The mirror reported on Friday .	-3.5724
Hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 referred to his 142 million followers as “ fake news ” in an instagram live video .	-3.0140
No , no , no , no .	-0.9858
What they say today , Fake News , ” said the five-time Balloon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-2.7904
" You want to apply for yourself by using my name .	-1.6764
“ That is normal .	-1.6166
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.1612
I am a happy person , and everything is good , ” added the player smiling .	-1.9453
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers prepare a complaint against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” because of the claims ; according to Reuters , you referred to “ inadmissible reporting on privacy suspicions . ”	-4.5075
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will be compensating for “ intangible damage to the seriousness of the injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personality rights in recent years . ”	-4.0775
The alleged incident is due to be attributed to a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.2151
According to documents submitted at the district district district of Clark County in the US State of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga retreated to the player 's room after getting to know at a night club where he raped them anal .	-5.5156
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was falling on the knee after the supposed incident , and said that he was “ to 99 % ” a “ good guy ” left in the lurch by the “ one percent ” .	-4.6225
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had sex , but it was agreed .	-10.5950
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and left photos of their injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had " fear of retaliation " and worried about being " publicly humiliated " .	-4.7583
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid because it remains traumatised by the supposed incident .	-3.3291
Ronaldo was shortly before his change to Real Madrid of Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and switched this summer with a 100 million euro deal to the Italian giant Juve .	-4.1201
Brexit : Britain would always regret losing car manufacturers	-1.6331
“ The United Kingdom would regret it timely if , after Brexit , it loses its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer , ” said Economic Secretary Greg Clark .	-3.2538
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK communicated to the BBC that they would temporarily cease production in their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.2227
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.1066
The Japanese automobile manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.0279
The factory in Burnaston , which produces Auris and Avensis for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.7509
“ When Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that our plant will stop production , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-3.9698
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.5853
BMW , for example , has already announced its work in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-2.5739
The most important concerns relate to what automotive manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-2.9735
The Toyota production facilities are based on need-oriented manufacturing , which means that the parts are supplied every 37 minutes of suppliers from the UK and the EU for special manufacturing .	-3.9911
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border that , according to industry claims , can lead to shortages and partial shortages .	-3.5219
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of stock in his work in Derbyshire , said the company , and that would stop production	-16.3796
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU was ‘ calibrated precisely to avoid these controls at the border ’ .	-15.1125
We have to have a deal ; we want the best deal that not only enables us to succeed , we want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the Today of BBC Radio 4 .	-4.5342
“ The note not only of Toyota , but also of other manufacturers , is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-11.3712
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stop could take , but warned that the cost increase in the long term could suffer the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-3.8338
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives and 24 years in Burnaston , said that trade union members are increasingly concerned : “ My experience is jobs , once they have been lost , are lost forever . ”	-4.3467
A government spokesman said : ' We have submitted a precise and credible plan for our future relations with the EU ' .	-2.6410
The Trump meeting with Rosenstein could postpone again , says the White House	-2.3780
Donald Trump ’ s high-class meeting with the deputy prosecutor , Rod Rosenstein , could be “ postponed another week ” because the fight for Supreme Candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-3.8552
Rosenstein supervises the work of the special adviser Robert Mueller , who examines Russia ’ s interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstruction of the judiciary by the president .	-3.6435
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Prosecutor ’ s Prosecutor , and to jeopardize Müller ’ s independence , Washington has brought much tradition for months .	-3.8984
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed the wearing of a cable to record talks with Trump and thus make it possible to remove the president from the 25st constitutional addition .	-10.2519
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.1843
Last Monday , however , he entered the White House , while reports hailed that he was close to resigning .	-3.9447
Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then in the United Nations in New York , was announced on Thursday .	-2.2825
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate ’ s Justice Committee , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , accused him of sexual misconh.	-4.7715
On Friday , Trump arranged a one-week FBI study of claims against Kavanaugh and continued to delay a full Senate vote .	-2.9039
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-1.7132
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A deadline has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I am pushing back another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-4.1625
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-1.8483
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.0716
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.2602
Sanders said that the lack of briefings did not result in television porters behaving like self-representatives , but she also said : ' I will not be against them in the gallery ' .	-5.0081
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press should increase .	-11.8030
" The President has answered more questions and answers than any president before him , " she said , and added , without evidence , ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-4.4363
Briefings will still take place , said Sanders , but the press should have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States directly the questions , if this is infinitely better than to talk to her .	-4.1233
We are trying to do a great deal of that , and you have seen how we have done this in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conversation if you can speak to the President of the United States himself . ”	-3.7715
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.2471
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.5682
In New York , the president may show this week why , by making a freelance and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-3.6465

The Scottish Parliament , Jane Freeman , wrote her letter less than six months before Britain leaves the EU .	-2.7903
The Scottish Government has agreed to cost the agreed status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralised public service .	-2.4928
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : ‘ During the summer , negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued on leaving , controlling on expected decisions in the autumn .	-3.3361
But the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-1.7513
I know that must be a very worrying time for you all .	-1.8825
That is why I wanted to repeat how much I would appreciate the contribution of each staff , regardless of his nationality .	-11.2161
Colleagues from all over the EU and beyond bring valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve our health care system and benefit the patients and communities we supply .	-3.6914

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax rate when buying real estate in Britain - the additional money will be used for homeless , Theresa May announces today .	-3.6095

" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I return this association to the Premier League ? "	-2.4306
With its structure and facilities , this club belongs undoubtedly to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.6949
“ It is not an easy task to create there , but I would probably only consider myself successful if I can bring the club back to it again . ”	-4.5729
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-2.8675
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third class , and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation in the following season to the master title .	-14.0922
Ross also says that he never felt as comfortable during his player career at Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academical as now .	-2.9866

Pub and bar groups experienced a turnover plus of 2.7 percent in July , but restaurants revenue fell 4.8 percent , so the numbers .	-4.6653
Peter Martin , from the CGA company consultancy , which put the numbers together , said : " Continuing sunshine and England 's longer than expected permanent participation in the World Cup meant that July followed a similar pattern as in June last month , when pub visits increased by 2.8 % only that restaurants were even more affected .	-5.8067
The decline in gastronomy business by 1.8 % in June only exacerbated in July .	-2.7731

The weather and effects of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to sales in the outdoor house market .	-3.1229
It is no wonder that restaurant groups will continue to be under pressure , although a 4.8 % revenue will be particularly painful compared to last year 's cost pressure .	-4.3382

Milk pump advertising , where mothers are compared with cows , has led to controversial online discussions	-15.2328
A milk pump company caused controversial online discussions due to an advertisement compared with silent mothers .	-3.6476
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " worldwide first noisy and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic , inspired advertising by music videos to show which freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.0603
Four real mothers dance in a haystack in the midst of cows to a number with the following songs : ' Yes , I remember , but you see no cock ' and ' if you did not notice that there are no eutern , there are my breasts ' .	-4.7720
The slogan continues : ' Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump , pump , pump off , I cut my ladies ' .	-4.3237
However , the advertisement published on the facebook page of the company provided online controversy .	-3.2248
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video received mixed reactions from spectators , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy economy .	-3.3214
" It is a very bad decision to advertise cows for this product . "	-1.9351
Like us , they must become pregnant and bear to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within just a few days after birth , " wrote a person .	-3.5311
The Elvie dairy pump fits inconspicuously in a Still-BH ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-2.8633
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.8926
But yes , why should we not advertise with them for a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.4238
Someone else added : ' Such an outside advertising ' .	-2.9520
Others defended advertising , including a woman who admits that she found the song “ urkomish . ”	-2.7224
I think that is a great idea .	-1.2752
I would have received one if I had still closed .	-2.3594
By pumping I felt like a cow .	-2.3011
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.4254
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-1.6278
Another commentary : ' This is a fun advertising for mothers who pump ( often in their jobs or toilets ) and like ' cows ' .	-3.0887
This is not advertising that praises or assesses the dairy industry . '	-2.8643
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced with the decent pumps in their bras .	-2.5876
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women who pump milk say that they feel like cows .	-14.4512
However , the Elvie Pump is completely noisy , has no wires or hoses and fits inconspicuously into a Still-BH , which means women have the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out of pump .	-5.1685
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative launch of the market .	-2.9145
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on the breast pump and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable manner the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-11.9342

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly to a tent camp on the Texas border .	-2.4015
The number of imprisoned children with a migration background increased , though monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-3.2327
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves and fear that they will risk being referred to the country when they campaign for a chil. for pepepeoppeoppepepe.	-12.1028
The risk increased in June , when the Federal Authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to give fingerprints and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-2.8569
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement authority , testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people applying to support unaccompanied minors .	-2.8864
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of the prisoners had no previous criminal records .	-2.6795
" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and much of them are criminal outsiders .	-3.4192
" We continue to follow these people , " said Albence .	-2.9642
In the effort to process applications for children more quickly , officials introduced new rules , which some of them demand to appear in court within a month after imprisonment , and not after 60 days , which was the previous standard , such as the staff of the accommodation .	-5.3076
Many will appear not personally , but via video telephone conference to plead for legal status in an immigration judge .	-4.1594
Those who do not question discharge will quickly be deported .	-2.5908
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they will be frightened or depressed , leading to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-3.5275
Advocates said that these concerns are being reinforced in a larger institution such as Tornillo , where signs that a child has to fight are more likely to be overlooked because of its size .	-4.3042
They added that the move of children to the tent centre without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or adopt themselves by friends could exacerbate a trauma with which many already fight .	-4.2036
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying troops ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.8857

“ You must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.1714
Moualem claimed that the “ war on terror ” in Syria was almost over ; more than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , and millions more have been driven out of their homes .	-3.8578
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence force . ”	-2.6084
The US has around 2,000 troops in Syria ; mainly training and advising both Kurdish armed forces and Syrian Arabs , who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.0235
France has used more than 1,000 soil soldiers in the war-destroyed country .	-2.2680
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for returning are right , and he accused “ some Western countries of fueling irrational fears ” that led refugees to abide by themse. pepeagagpepeagagagagagagagagagagagag	-15.9382
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” says Moualem .	-2.0651
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-1.4716
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition were reached over an end to the war .	-3.8316
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel castle Idlib creates the opportunity to advance political talks .	-3.7202
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack on the province of Syrian troops supported by Russia , in which three million people live .	-2.5798
However , Moualem stressed that the agreement sets out “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that the military approach will be directed against jihadists , including combatants from the Nusra Front associated with al-Qaeda , which are “ extinguished . ”	-5.0541
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.0500

Bond 's daughter Karen Jankel , who was born shortly after the acceptance of the book , said about the letter : It is hard to enable someone to read it for the first time before the release .	-3.4118
“ It is very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-11.0753
She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman , and then inspired to write a children ’ s book from a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of the book release was “ bittersweet ” after his death last year .	-4.3905

Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to determine ?	-1.7222
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-1.7369

Pyongyang has not spoken publicly .	-1.6985

Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally exceeded the border since the end of the Korean war in 1953 .	-1.8722
Most flee China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.6334
China considers the overflows to be illegal migrants , not refugees , and often returns them .	-3.0099

Nancy Pelosi calls Brett Kavanaugh hysterically and says that he is inappropriate for the Supreme Court service	-2.6529
The Chairman of the Democratic Minority Group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , “ hysterically ” the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court and said that he was inadequate from the temperament to serve the Supreme Court .	-3.5230
Pelosi made comments on an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.9231
“ I could not think differently that if a woman had ever behaved in this way , they would have called it “ hysterically , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-3.0963
Kavanaugh demented the claims that he attacked Dr. sexually , when they were both young people .	-3.6332
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he shouted almost and fought with the tears when he spoke about his family and high-school years .	-2.8410
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated calling campaign ” organized by Liberals , who are angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-3.1374
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court , as he showed that he was biased against Democrats .	-3.0907
“ I think he disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he can affect the Clintons and the Democrats , ” she said .	-3.0265
When asked whether , in the event of its confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , she would seek a lifting procedure against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-3.8783
“ I want to say the following : if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI , he is not only unsuitable for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service in the court at which he is currently employed , ” said Pelosi .	-4.6978
Kavanaugh is currently district judge in D.C. Appeal Court .	-2.2976
Pelosi added that she was a democrat concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , because he stands for conservative justice .	-3.4307
In his hearings of confirmation , Kavanaugh has answered questions as to whether he would tie up certain decisions of the Supreme Court .	-15.6020
“ It is not the time for a hysterical , biased person to go to the court and expect us to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” said Pelosi .	-9.2310

" When we become angry , " Mrs Steiner said to me 45 years later .	-2.6841
'I do not think that this is unusual , or ? '	-2.0930
She continued : “ I once helped a woman in the executive who told me that she was also wearing when she was angry , but she developed a technique whereby she was angry and started to cry , to the person with whom she spoke , said : “ You may think I ’ m sad because I cry .	-5.5398
I am angry . '	-1.8003
And then she simply continued .	-1.9866
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.0311
Trains are allowed as valve for anger because they are basically misunderstood .	-2.4974
One of my strongest memories of an early job in an office dominated by men , where I once came with indescribable anger , was that I was packed on the neck by an older woman , a clever manager before whom I was always somewhat frightened - who dragged me into a staircst.	-12.3381

Someone called it ' snow weather and the seven dwarves ' . '	-1.9473
Because the campaign has long been under way , it was lagging behind with funding , and so she swore she would not participate in the race unless she collected $ 2 million .	-4.2339
It was a lost battle .	-1.3019
She noted that some of her supporters , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would only give it $ 250 .	-2.8703
“ Think that I get adventure lorries ? ” she wondered .	-3.5492
When she made her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people they had supported , frustration over the system that made it so difficult to gather money and raise voters instead of delegates , and anger over sexism - that it was suffocated .	-4.1878
“ You might think I have a collapse of nerves , ” Schroeder remembers how the press reacted to them .	-11.3292

China answers every blow of the US , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second largest economy will surrender in the near future .	-3.2254
Bringing Washington to direct means giving in to demands , but publicly bowing to the United States would be far too blamable for Xi Jinping , the President of China .	-3.7559
But if Beijing takes advantage of his opportunities , the trade war with the US can have a positive impact on China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependencies of both economies , experts say .	-15.3661
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , scientific staff at the Center for New American Security , a think tank focused on Asia .	-3.3189
