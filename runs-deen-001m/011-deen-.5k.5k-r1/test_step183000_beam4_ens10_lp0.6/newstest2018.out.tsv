Munich 1856 : Four cards that change your view of the city	-2.0211
A mistake where young people are to meet today .	-2.5505
A chapel where the S-Bahn tunnel is now digged .	-3.7491
Small gardeners manage the former reason for farmers .	-2.0422
The oldest official map in Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.1825
It is nervous if maps are not up to date .	-2.2595
Everyone who has already had to get up because the car navi instead of a bypass showed a green meadow .	-4.6498
The historical maps of the Bavarian digital atlas , an offer of the Bavarian Geoportal of the State Government , are far from current , but therefore very informati.	-5.0590
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-2.0357
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the Munich district .	-14.0245
The Bavarian digital atlas is a patchwork that is not recognized as such .	-3.6388
The big overview map included more detailed maps for cities and communities , so-called urposition leaflets .	-3.6512
According to the Bavarian survey management , they were created between 1810 and 1864 and come from the first survey of Bavaria .	-4.1726
Your Customer : Napoleon .	-1.1972
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the Second Coalition War with Austria .	-1.9762
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic reception of Bavaria - of course for military purposes .	-2.8036
Although the French troops eventually deducted from the peace of Lunéville on 9 February 1801 , they were today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a Bavarian map that covers the area .	-4.8176
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued the project , founded the " Topographical Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-3.4334
The Urpositionsblatt für Munich dates back to 1856 and is like all the others on the website of the Bavarian LandesbLib.	-4.2587
The comparison of earlier / today is most impressive in the capital of the country .	-3.7843
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-2.3304
One example of this is the subsended , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-4.1929
Sendling was meant 21 years after the creation of the map , in 1877 , as a district of Munich .	-3.5175
Today it is located in the middle of the city .	-3.0545
The Häuser Untersendlings concentrate around 1856 along the present Plinganser Road , which was named only in 1878 after Georg Sebastian Plinganser , a leader of the insurgency of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-3.8070
Where the West Park is today , you see nothing as fields - at first glance : a smaller part card with dozens of lines and numbers appears in the hindsight zooming : handwritten pieces of the so-called " extension " from which the land tax was derived .	-7.0401
Small plots no longer show farmers there today - but small gardeners of the plant " land in sun " .	-3.7884
A large green area is north of Untersendling .	-2.9597
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the scene of the Oktoberfest , was actually a meadow in the nineteenth century - and not a concrete desert .	-9.6557
On the other hand , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.4270
In the Urpositionsblatt reads not only the street name " on the Gasteig " or the hill " Auf der Lüften " - but also in large letters " Irren Anstalt " .	-16.4523
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e people were once blocked with madness .	-3.2668
In 1858 / 59 the Munich circle irrenanstalt was created " Auer Lüften " .	-4.3185
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the establishment - the psychiatrist who was brought in connection with the death of King Ludwig II .	-3.5991
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the chain of so-called errors .	-2.7307
He has also prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition on the institution .	-3.7620
280 patients were initially in place , and 500 places were later extended .	-4.5088
At some point , this capacity was no longer enough - the reason for the construction of the circular institution in Haar 1905 .	-3.5924
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper clinic in Munich and Ost , one of Germany ’ s largest psychiatries , has been located there .	-4.8173
On the premises of the former Auer Institute , young people meet in the Munich Salesian .	-4.1981
The order acquired the building complex in 1920 and transformed it into a youth home with training facilities .	-2.8441
Western lies the football court of the TSV Munich East , eastern houses of the 1980s .	-3.8046
In 2015 , the children ’ s house “ Casa Don Bosco ” was built in architectural context of the origin of the error institution , which was destroyed in the Second World War in bombing attacks .	-5.2704
The Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as " main square " , the Kauffingerstra<unk>e was called " Kauffinger Gasse " .	-3.9376
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-2.4650
The Allied bombs break many holes into the city in December 1944 .	-3.1768
One big stop to this day - at the Marienhof .	-3.4187
The English Institute , small business houses and a group chapel from the Middle Ages once stood at Marienhof , where the preparatory works and on 5 April 2017 the Spatenstich for the second S-Bahn route .	-4.7373
With the slider , the old Munich card can be compared to the air image of today - and the hole at the Marienhof .	-4.0482
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-1.7625
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri because of the discriminatory politics and racist attacks by the state .	-3.3473
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on Afro-American travellers , visitors and Missourians to pay particular attention to travelling through the state and to make extreme caution , since a number of questionable , racial incidents have recently occurred and noted throughout the state , " says the opinion of the group .	-5.9023
A recently passed Missouri law , which makes it more difficult for people to gain discrimination actions , and the state ’ s law enforcement authorities , which are disproportionately aimed at minorities , led the group to issue travel warning , said NAACP .	-4.6921
'You have violations of civil rights that happen to people .	-2.5471
They are stopped because of their skin color , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , Kansas City Star .	-2.7483
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet ' .	-2.3164
It is the first warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.5257
The group quoted incidents such as racist offences against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.2344
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year after he had no fuel during his trip through the state and was custody by the police of Missouri without being accused of being criminal .	-4.4194
The Council also points to a recent report by the office of the Missouri Prosecutor , which shows that black drivers in the state are more frequently stopped than white .	-3.8908
" The recommendation is that people are aware of and inform their families , friends and employees about what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel e .	-10.1520
" People must be prepared to bring bail money or to know the relatives that they travel through the state . "	-3.2849
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s Hass Crime Report Programme , which classify the state in terms of the number of injuries to the country ’ s 16th rank .	-4.2340
The travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or discrimination against employment .	-2.8025
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , having passed immigration laws , committing local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , which the ACLU believes will contribute to further racial profiling .	-3.7372
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Foreign Ministry for other countries , but recently interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.1918
Elementary grassroots project	-3.5127
The Fisherbacher Weidezaun Project is a success project and will continue next year .	-7.9618
The CDU federal members Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac have gained an image on the ground .	-3.7476
At the Schwendemann family ’ s courtyard , representatives of the Fisherbacher CDU local association met with mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-3.7632
Markus Schwendemann first gave insights into his company , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , 40 dairy cows and as many young animals as well , and houses holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.8153
The " Black Forest Milk " is for him the alternative marketing route for the milk of his cows , so Schwendemann .	-3.5706
On the table of our guests comes exclusively regional .	-4.1721
As he is also the BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he described the grassroots project as " elementary important " .	-3.6069
I cannot profit from such steep areas .	-2.3744
The grassland area provides a great deal of work and much needs to be done with the engine sense .	-4.1912
" We have to fight here with the conditions and with topography , " said Schwandemann .	-2.8878
In 2003 he took over the parental business and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he does not run a bio-operation .	-13.4996
For mayor Thomas Schneider was clear : " The municipality has recognized the importance of the pasture project and is glad about the leader promotion " .	-4.4594
Farmers would have to be supported in the event of a cost of EUR 3000 to EUR 4 000 per hectare .	-3.5082
One hopes that this could pull out the afforestation of land for a while .	-4.4358
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they continue to operate , " said the Mayor .	-3.7409
Farmers often stand in criticism because of the promotion .	-3.6291
In 2013 , a total of 25 parcels were fenced by eleven participants through grass fencing .	-3.4765
The openness area is thus 40 hectares , which must not be forested until at least 2023 .	-3.4011
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half was encouraged via leader , a quarter wore the municipality of Fischerbach .	-3.7811
Thus , farmers remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of grassroots fences .	-3.3949
" The great advantage is the longevity of the fences , " explained Schwendemann .	-2.6287
Kordula Kovac emphasised : " You are doing a good job , without farmers and farmers it does not work " .	-4.1463
For Peter Wei<unk> , too , stood firm : " This is where best food is produced " .	-3.7894
The Landscape Protection Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables the state to promote grassroots fences .	-3.2757
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-1.4230
The presence of a funding scene called the LPR is a prerequisite .	-3.5798
Moreover , the area to be fenced must not be slow-manageable ( hang-tendency more than 35 % ) and must be threatened by afforestation .	-5.0153
For the Fisherbacher Weidezaunproject in 2018 , the application for eight participants with 24 plots that want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence is currently under way .	-4.1702
The openness area corresponds to 35 hectares , the calculated costs are over EUR 112 000 .	-3.0575
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.8481
Now the Trump White House is taking over the Statue of Liberty	-2.6398
The safest sign of a regime change is when they begin to attack the statues .	-2.8235
The Americans appreciate them as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at the firdos place in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.8209
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologists of the Trump regime , certainly knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the statue of liberty .	-3.4942
To stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.5511
A horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have linked him if he had done so .	-2.1379
But he attacked its importance , and in particular the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-3.9317
When Miller Acosta said : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the statue of liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-3.5094
The poem to which you refer , which was later added , not part of the original statue of liberty . '	-2.6655
Miller is factually right , but as he himself said , it is not really about history .	-3.3169
It is a question of contemporary response to the emerging words of Lazarus , the only one where a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mouths , your poor , / your afflicted masses , who long to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts ' .	-5.6481
There was never a time when the " wretched waste " was better seen on our screens .	-2.7744
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.6675
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict about the importance of America .	-2.7485
Lazarus - and her friends who worked to place their words on the basis of death - knew very well that they took a highly political act .	-3.7275
The sculpture should demonstrate the links between French and American Republicanisms by representing the female embodiment of freedom in a classic picture that has been used .	-4.9985
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received one vote .	-4.5528
And she gives herself a completely different name : mother of the exiles .	-6.4855
The combination of poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.0149
And , just as Lazarus changed the importance of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change this for a long time .	-3.0071
The great shriek Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the statue of liberty was not an invitation to anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame to the night-night world : " Lady Liberty is proceeding .	-4.8850
It is meant to wear the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.1627
The torch should not enlighten the way to the United States ' .	-2.2733
Rather unusual Limbaugh has encountered something here .	-3.2955
The importance of the statue is quite a matter of perception .	-2.6042
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them as they were seen by the exhausted , mistaken but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-3.4403
It is truly about seeing the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.7899
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome they must hear .	-1.9986
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise .	-2.6194
Their torch should not enlighten the way , but inflame the hatred that is its only source of power .	-3.4493
World Championship 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the Uteam	-9.1344
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belong to the United Kingdomper.	-3.7667
The United Kingdom ’ s power director , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish quota in the World Championship Chad will make a massive contribution to the " .	-11.6503
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-1.9632
Black believes that ' something special develops in Scotland ' and the United Kingdom 's lightweight athletics must learn something from it .	-3.4721
" We welcome it and we try to understand it , and we will continue until we find it , " said Black .	-2.4636
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2039
The Scottish athletes think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-1.9118
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.4225
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.4976
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant ' .	-1.9967
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal athletes , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team to team captain .	-4.2879
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.3451
Your captain speech was incredible , " says Black .	-1.6443
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and were very motivated .	-2.6093
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh naturally brought in were great . '	-3.3656
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will take place at the 400m hurdles in her fifth World Cup , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-3.7339
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven that were reached in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.4804
The Muir Medium Runner leads along this path and established five British and two European records last year .	-3.9795
It will take part in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m runs .	-2.5815
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 metres , is another Scot that was to be observed after a great season that included the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.1511
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in the Team Lee McConnell .	-2.7131
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots will not only belong to the team , but also , in some cases , to the medals and to the finals .	-4.1347
" The special thing about being team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , it makes it too special for me , " added them .	-4.2638
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team .	-1.8110
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.2904
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise to podia .	-2.5408
What is my speech as a captain ?	-1.9009
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.3394
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home World Cup .	-2.7792
It is therefore really important to insist on this home support and benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-9.9586
I get a second chance to go out there and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there . '	-3.0582
Block critics over Facebook : Don 't win a public office if you cannot contract voters ' heating	-4.3861
Our country ’ s father knew something of bad press .	-1.7056
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him because of everything , from domestic politics to his political principles .	-2.7119
He slipped in criticism , safe .	-3.0921
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.0608
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and silent we are led to slaughter like sheep ' .	-3.5112
This brings me to Governor Larry Hogan , after Maryland , who must work on being more like Washington .	-2.2707
Hogan ’ s employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.1143
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week .	-1.6839
The staff of the governor released the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-2.8547
" It is only Facebook , " said many people .	-1.6160
But it is important .	-0.9137
And it is especially important when it is a type like Hogan .	-1.8287
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular .	-1.6308
He has the second highest consent of the 50 governors of the nation .	-1.9650
Hogan is not a reactionary heat .	-1.0809
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict compliance with the principles .	-3.1457
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means to connect to his voters and playing his hairless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-3.8165
Therefore , the blocking of people who come to the side of the governor - which is a public forum , called official and by staff paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessarily and ultimately dangerous .	-4.8466
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-13.9373
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing online sticks .	-2.5829
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-1.6389
And these are just real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , not trolls .	-8.0503
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful and not professional .	-1.8641
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan ’ s Catholic faith .	-2.0659
Lawyer Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.1097
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no response to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the commentary area of the news sending " The Post " .	-3.0816
'I do not appreciate this idea either if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some people are disregarded more than a so-called collective commitment , not recognised as a large group of citizens affected . '	-5.5784
What the governor 's employees called the " concentrated spam attack " would others probably call " advocacy " .	-3.7468
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.7670
It is much cleaner than in previous times if you had done the same that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical guidelines or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-3.8786
This is what is happening digitally .	-8.8585
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.1092
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who were blocked by his Twitter feed . talped with him .	-11.4142
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-1.8140
The chairman of the Loudoun County ’ s Board of Supervisors violated the First Amendment , according to US District James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook page .	-3.3950
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from ACLU because of his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.4409
That should not be so difficult .	-1.7797
At the time of Washington , the time of affordable porto had a similar effect to the Internet .	-2.5865
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous writers suggested his leadership .	-2.9331
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2750
People using pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that drove Washington 's decisions .	-2.7405
Petitions that criticised his position on the Amity Treaty , trade and shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of the George Washington Project .	-3.1480
But he did not silence them .	-0.9928
Freedom of speech , divergence and discourse form the basis of our nation .	-2.0164
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.5494
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-1.9687
Former Europeans No 1 Ronan Rafferty will hope for local comfort over the next three days , as the Renaissance Club in East Lothian will organise the 25th issue of the Scottish Senior Open .	-9.1893

" The players will see this course from his best side , it is in a great state .	-2.4793
Jerry did a great job when he set this place .	-2.6255
He is a keen advocate of this game and is proud of its performance here .	-2.5612
This is a great storefront for this course ' .	-1.6089
The English Eales looks forward to defending a championship for the first time , although in his 32-year career he won both the European Tour and the European Challenge Tour .	-3.0502
" This really feels especially , " said the player who homes in Southport .	-11.4083
" I did not defend the Extremadura Open because it was taken out of the program in the year after I won it .	-9.7947

It was a really special time and one that we will always appreciate . '	-2.1979
Gary Orr , who came to the European Senior Tour after his 50th birthday earlier this year , returns to action on home ground .	-3.3928
This event will be his first Scottish performance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-1.6913
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-2.1086
" You want to do it well , but you also feel this additional pressure .	-2.4888
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-2.1476
I am glad about how things have gone so far . . '	-12.7682
The trio in the field includes the former Masters winner Ian Woosnam and the Senior Major Champions Paul Broadhurst , Roger Chapman , Mark James and Mark McNulty .	-2.7371
Orr and the former Ryder Cup captain Sam Torrance are among the six Scots in the field , the others are Andrew Oldcorn , Stephen McAllister , Bill Longmuir and Ross Drummond .	-2.4760

Fewer Lung Cancer Deaths by Passive Smoking	-2.2502
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking in lung cancer .	-2.1331
The result is that scientists from the Hamburg-Eppendorf University Clinic ( UKE ) are in a study .	-3.7061
" According to our estimates , 167 passive cancer deaths per year are due to passive smoking , " said Heiko Becher studhman .	-15.0638
He compared his own study on this issue in 1994 .	-2.6674
At that time there were 400 passive smoking deaths in Germany .	-1.9713
The new investigation is released in the " International Journal of Public Health " .	-1.9503
Domestic connections turn out to be very complex . ff. fff. . . . . . .	-13.0535
The construction works in Villinger Strasse are in full swing and " are somewhat in time " , says the head of the Bauhof Fred Heinze .	-4.0595
In the area of domestic connections , the situation is more complicated than suspected , because underground conceals what is not noted in the plans .	-14.9518
The traffic that constantly impedes the construction work is a major problem for the construction force of the company Stump .	-4.5972
" The ignorance of drivers before red traffic lights and barriers is already enormous , " reports Heinze .	-2.9312
The road is closed and only the buses are entitled to pass through .	-3.2356
Angelo Caruso , Marvin Kostorz and Tim Kostorz of the company Stumpp have been working on the bridge for weeks .	-2.4346

The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the road to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-13.0502

One of the soldiers stimulated their sound and later came back with four soldiers , such as the local Pastor Yavedt Tebai .	-3.4444
The soldiers who had drunk were hunting and beating the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-10.6873
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.6897

Three weeks in Jayapura , Jokowi made a passionate speech in which he expressed sympathy for the victims ' families and swore to address the historical abuses in Papua .	-3.0801
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-9.6970
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he set up an extrajudicial mechanism to resolve historical human rights violations .	-2.4091
But the excuses started almost immediately .	-1.1869
" Most of the injuries happened a long time ago . pepeoppeople around . people in thinking throupe.	-16.0649
Some were in the 90 ’ s and early 2000 ’ s .	-1.6451
The point is that we have undertaken to address these infringements , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .	-2.9331
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said that he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.0201
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.2367
Wiranto , whom the UN has accused of ' crimes against humanity ' , which caused more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote of 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been resolved in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-3.9098
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such claims with grim infidelity .	-2.1601

The shootings have not stopped .	-1.9964
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniai ’ s neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.1926
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company refusing to bring a conscious man to the hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-3.1371
The man , the 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-3.0614
Excited villagers protested at the company ’ s office .	-9.9098
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warnings .	-2.9686
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot off and killed one .	-2.6614
" We were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lived near the hospital and who was witnesses how the injured were quickly introduced here , such as TIME .	-4.6345
'I hid myself two days in my house ' .	-1.6510
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area .	-3.0853
Paniai has always been an unrest for the Indonesian Government .	-2.1442
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribal members of the Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal who live in the green highlands of Papua .	-2.9440
Many joined the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of the Papua by initiating sporadic attacks and kidnappings by Indonesian soldiers .	-3.0522
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.6061
In response to this , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily custody in recent years , on the pretext of ' securing national sovereignty ' .	-2.8899
Some never again appear .	-2.1748
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.3185
Poverty reinforces discontent .	-1.2011
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.9345
Bread is just as swift .	-2.4745
People here build everything they eat : especially nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-3.0899
Agriculture is the task of women who can edit four or five fields of sweet potatoes .	-2.8319
They retain most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.1091
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.4835
Over time , economic inequalities have increased between the local Papua and the new migrants , who have arrived in larger numbers since the opening of new airport routes to Nabire .	-3.7067
The few jobs that exist in the region normally go to better educated and wealthier migrants .	-2.4307
Papua rarely have capital or the necessary skills to manage their own companies competitively .	-2.8556
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money " , says John Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council of Paniai .	-2.4757
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.2307
Furthermore , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense .	-2.7465
Earlier this year , the French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported because of a lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , even though rare permission was given to them to film fil.	-4.0120
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Asian Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jokowi ’ s election campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not implemented .	-3.6477
" There are new dangers to foreign journalists who try to report from Indonesia 's troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-10.6775
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government is largely limited to Papua 's immediate neighbours .	-2.5918
In March , six Pacific countries - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Salomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the ' various and widespread violations ' in Papua , including the Paniai shooting .	-12.5416
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.7246
The spokesman of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Arrmanatha Nasir , refused to accuse the group and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia , there is still a democratic system , and there is free media , so it is difficult to cover the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-3.9066
People on the ground want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.7505
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and afflicted him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wanted to remain anonymous .	-10.2927
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Yokowi again .	-2.3602
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but it is surrounded by people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the chairman of the tribal council .	-3.0350
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor education and health services .	-2.8915
Gobai says that Paniai people , like other Papua , regard their voice for Jokowi as a " blame " he has to pay back .	-3.3300
" They don 't need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.1251
Despite the threats and intimidation , the Paniai victims ’ families carried out a last symbolic act of despite : the body of a victim was buried on an area precisely with the police and the military station .	-4.2389
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .	-3.2745

Fires capture the ' Torch ' skyscraper from Dubai for the second time	-2.9301
A fire took place on Friday in one of the highest residential towers in the world in Dubai and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 metres high 79-floor buildings .	-3.9628
It is the second fire which , in just two years ' time , is swept through the high house , which is randomly called the Torch-Tower ( torch tower ) .	-5.6708
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-1.9346

We ran down the staircase and it took about 10 minutes to come down from the 50th floor " , a resident who told his name as George , Reuters .	-3.3239
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire fighting units at 4 : 00 am local time ( 00.00 am GMT ) deleted the fire and cooled the building .	-3.7127
The government said it was working on providing housing for those affected .	-2.7293
The incident can revitalise material safety issues used in outdoor areas of high-houses around the world .	-3.8718
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the facing , the outside clothing to decoration or isolation .	-3.9363
In Britain , the police said that they believe that the system of disks for isolation and fairing at the London Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .	-4.3413

We will continue to work to improve the application .	-2.5830
Not until the vote , after many objections , had already come before the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place .	-9.7710

More than 1 out of 5 US travellers brings forbidden items into the aircraft , finds a survey	-7.1936
A survey among airline passengers showed that more than 20 % deliberately or unconsciously banned objects at US Transportation Security Administration control points past smuggled , including at least 6 % that entered the aircraft , while accidentally banned knives or other blades .	-4.7583
Less than 1 % claimed that they were late in discovering that they were mistakenly traveled with shot weapons , ammunition or explosives .	-3.8989
The survey of more than 1,000 people - who were carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers were more disregarding the rules .	-12.5498
Of the respondents who admitted that they tried knowledgeably to fly with something prohibited by the TSA , 19.7 % Millennials were compared to less than 15 % of the members of generation X .	-13.6718
The most common objects passed by TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.4085
More than 3 % agreed to have knowledgeably worn objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately banned drugs into the aircraft .	-4.7829
The company said it had questioned travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidental smuggling goods would have brought about airport safety and how many would have intentionally done .	-4.1149
It is no surprise that people who wear the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - were those who fly most often .	-10.3411
However , the company points out that the TSA directives are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.0777
People are often uncertain what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-3.0205
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids confiscated by the TSA are banned .	-3.2617
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smuggling goods .	-2.4400
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.6139
Elon Musk does not matter : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel orders	-1.7461
Electro-thousandsassa Elon Musk is happy to indicate with the huge number of preorders for his new Tesla " Model 3 " . for !!!!!!!!!!!	-10.0931
So far he has suggested that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservation .	-3.5584
In addition to the always triumphant figures on sales increases and even more gigantic sales targets , Tesla leader Elon Musk has for the first time betrayed another less glossy number when announcing the recent quarter balance : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-5.6774
Musk had often advertised over the past few months with the more than 500,000 preorders for the new car , whose delivery is just beginning .	-4.1436
Now Musk admits : 63,000 have already been withdrawn from the total of 518,000 preorders .	-2.8367
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these were only non-binding reservations .	-12.4611
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the € 1000 ( $ 1000 in the United States and 1000 pounds in the United Kingdom ) ' Reservation Deposit ' fully .	-5.2193
Currently , 455,000 such non-binding reservations are available , Musk has entered a telephone conference with analysts .	-3.7862
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that cancelling around 12 % of all orders could become a problem .	-3.2165
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets lies not in demand , but on the production side .	-2.8712
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.5577
In 2018 - all models together - 500,000 , 2020 one million .	-3.2292
The demand for this is obviously there .	-1.8323
According to Musk , 1800 reservations are currently made per day .	-2.0799
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " today may expect extradition at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production roads that have never been tested in practice without maximum interruptions .	-5.4575
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.2251
But if there are major delays , the non-binding reservations could become the problem for Tesla .	-3.9005
After all , the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves .	-8.1892
EPA Chief Pruitt is withdrawing from the Obama Era rules on reducing emissions .	-15.9901
One day after he was sued by 15 countries , Scott Pruitt , the head of the environmental protection authority , returned his earlier decision to delay the implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce the emissions of smog of air pollutants .	-4.0968
Pruitt presented change when his agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.0934
He did not mention the complaint made against his previous body in a Federal Appeal Court .	-2.6236
It is a deadline that took place on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-14.3199
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and avoid ' interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth ' .	-3.1330
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump ’ s Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma before he was appointed , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental protection renenvironmentenenenenenenenenenen. enenenen	-11.4873
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that resist the chemical industry and the industry of fossil fuels .	-2.7731
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the pruitts regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.0422
Last month , a federal appeal court in Washington decided that the EPA administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration obliging oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-3.1326
In a position published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that his reverse turn in ozone standards simply reinforce the EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with the States through the complex process of meeting the new standards in time .	-12.3291
" Among previous administrations , the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.0134
" We do not believe in regulation through judicial proceedings , and we take deadlines seri.	-9.5987
We also take the law and authority that exists seriously ' .	-8.8478
Nevertheless , the EPA 's opinion stated that , at some point , Pruitt will use its ' power to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on a sound policy and the best available information ' .	-4.2458
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a broader recast of ozone rules .	-2.0624
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.3618
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.3929
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of the states that sued the EPA this week , said that the group intended to maintain the legal pressure .	-3.6514
" The reversal of EPAs - after our complaints - is an important gain for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-3.7746

Association wants to allow wind wheels to be tein .	-11.1548
" Boisheim is resisting " does not see any legal requirement for construction and has therefore turned to the country 's country .	-4.3831
The association " Boisheim defends itself " has asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its permission to establish planned wind power plants in the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.6109
It has been unlawful .	-1.5600
The association argues that , at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheimer Nette , since at the time in Viersen only a wind power concentration zone existed at the Schwalmtal border .	-4.8615
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind energy plants are fundamentally possible , but the concentration zone also causes the exclusion of wind power to the rest of the city .	-4.7522
These zones are intended to prevent a ' making ' of the landscape .	-4.2625
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette a few days earlier by changing the land use plan , the district government Düsseldorf had not approved because of a form error .	-5.1685
" The lack of planning requirement remains unlawful and therefore also unlawful , " said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim " .	-4.2278
Current state of affairs : the Council again decided , before the summer , the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; the authorisation of the district government is still to be approved .	-5.1442
Recognition : ' This excludes the granting of authorisation for the establishment of wind energy plants at dis' ' . '	-12.8532
The circle confirms the receipt of the request .	-1.7270
" The corresponding letters have been received at the Viersen circle last week , " explained a speaker .	-3.1705
The circle takes them the opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-2.5630
However , they are unlikely to stop the procedure .	-3.0929
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the circle did not want to speak on Thursday on the content of the argument of the association " Boisheim defends itself " .	-4.2809
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning the construction of four 200 meters high wind wheels on a surface at the Boisheimer Nette .	-4.2162
Already last year , the company in which the city of Viersen is involved had concluded leasing contracts with the owner of the approximately 65 hectares of terrain .	-4.3222
With the establishment of the four wind power plants , the need for electricity can be met by some 11 400 households , which meets roughly one-fifth of the need for electricity for all four-sea households .	-5.1613
NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-1.8433
Last summer , Viersen ’ s city council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Windpark Linnich near Aachen , as well as participation in a wind energy plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the Heinsberg district .	-4.3979

Bad Langensalza and people from the region should rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.6783
The Industrial Association and the City Administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the city 's shopping street .	-4.4047
As the Chairman of the Association of Commerce , Christian König , announced , the " Home Shopping " weekend is intended to raise awareness of the customers who offer their own city without the usual supermarket goods .	-5.5078

Furthermore , domestic companies should present their training places .	-12.8084
Furthermore , the city 's shops are invited to " Midnight Shopping " .	-4.3248
The action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the nearer region .	-3.6726
In preparation are advertising spots in the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the weekend of action , Christian King .	-3.5097
The Chamber of Commerce and City Association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-3.4412

These include travellers and tourists .	-9.5499

At the end of the day , everyone would have to help revive the city centre , right up to the lessons , the entire city and associations .	-5.5822
To overcome the lethargy with a network that sometimes broadened , King said in spring .	-15.4262
Birgit Streich , Head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen announced that the nationwide third " home-shopping " tag was involved for the first time in five Thuringian cities .	-4.4498
Besides Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Saint Town and Bleicherode .	-10.0823
The day should ' advertise the value of local trade and strengthen its importance to the common good of our cities ' , says Strike .	-4.2221
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen can influence his own direct environment with his purchasing behaviour .	-4.1583

Trump put pressure on Mexico ’ s telephone calls for leaked transcripts for border walls	-3.2775
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and Mexico and Australia leaders were published by the Washington Post .	-1.9850
On 27 January , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.4017
The US President insulted him because he publicly denounced the wall , according to him he said : ' You cannot say that to the press ' .	-3.9319
Trump launched his presidential campaign with the promise to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and swore to pay Mexico for the project .	-2.7128
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.1915
Mr. Trump said to Mr. Turnbull that trade for the US would be ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence of trade , which was conveyed by the Obama administration , would look like a ' depp ' after he had proposed a ban on the relocation of refugees to the US .	-4.7492
Mr. Trump finished the call after he said to Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call all all day ' .	-10.8347
Moore Ford Massacre : Activists restore racist lynchact as a call for justice	-2.2771
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and stumbled on the Ford bridge of Moore .	-3.6120
Before the car that had four black passengers and a white rider could reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with rifles to block his way .	-3.3574
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strip suit - took a long train to his cigar and looked through the windscreen testing .	-3.4408
Inside the occupants were floatin fear .	-3.7450
" We want this n --- r Roger ! " brülled the man .	-2.5708
'Hol him from the car ! '	-1.2749
Cry torn the silence when a young black man was broken up by the front-passenger seat .	-3.1074
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just an imitation .	-10.7429
But when a sling is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience gave up very real sights .	-4.4557
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night where two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.4043
No one has ever been charged for the murders .	-2.1708
" It is really incomprehensible that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organize follow-up .	-4.3904
'It is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden on our souls ' .	-2.8269
Brooks is a 71-year-old congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime of civil rights .	-2.9341
It serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual memory of the Monroe community that a wrong has never been corrected .	-3.4268
" We want prosecution , we want ending , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to get justice , " he said .	-3.1383
'We cannot get to heal and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.2101
A court medicine lays a sheet over the corpse of one of the victims of the Moore Ford lynches on 27 July 1946 .	-3.9359
According to FBI files received by the NBC news , more than 50 men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-2.6925
No one has ever been charged .	-1.9762
Although suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for Lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-3.3997
In April 1946 , a decision by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens in Georgia for the first time to vote in the summer election campaign .	-2.8648
About at the same time as the election , according to the FBI of the black farms Roger Malcom stacked a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a struggle - allegedly because of a woman .	-4.2069
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester slept with Malcom ’ s wife Dorothy , and that the baby she was not from her husband .	-3.1896
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to liberate Malcom from prison , the FBI .	-2.7776
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-1.7159
But when they then moved away from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.0047
" As it turns out , it was Harrison , who prepared and ordered the murders , " closes a FBI report .	-14.8706
" It is also obvious that there was a complete plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered the identity of witnesses " .	-3.4865
Brooks puts it even more concise .	-9.6141
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.7252
" They were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you are registered and if you vote , then this will happen to you . "	-3.9364
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has led the annual suspension of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-2.8682
Their presentation is illustrative , taking and is based on a kind of deep racism , many of which want to believe that he no longer exists in America .	-4.3456
It is difficult to watch and to look away even more difficult , but Greene said that this is the point .	-2.9010
" We do not want to talk about the lynch because we are faced with its ugliness in all of us , " she said .	-3.4253
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have gone through " .	-2.8716
The samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of black - pushed into a space and listened when Greene started a well-played overview of the piece .	-3.6549
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co director .	-1.6815
He has played the role of the head clan member for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-2.4774
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.4180
'But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return at these times ' .	-2.7819
On the other hand , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who played Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-2.2646
The piece begins with Malcom , who shouts and afflicts him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-3.5219
" I said n -- he , disappear from my property ! "	-1.4737
Rascona returns the fire .	-0.9914
There is a break .	-0.7714
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in luxury .	-2.4524
Greene laughs most loudest .	-1.7986
" What ? " , Rascona asked .	-1.4313
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.9959
Was I too hard ?	-0.6257
'No ' , Greene said , still kichering .	-1.8636
" I just do not think that white people said ' n -- he ' .	-2.2672
" But " , joined one of the other black performers .	-2.8747
'You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-1.8826
And that is exactly where the energy shifts in the room , a sense of comradeship replaces the unease .	-3.9916
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-2.8439
The scene starts again .	-1.4603
This time when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.7591
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.4210
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-2.2185
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.3997
A woman , dressed with a mourning dress , stands over the corpses of the actors and executes Billie Holidays mourning lobbrede " Strange Fruit " .	-4.4352
Your voice breaks in every second word .	-2.3413
About a hundred meters behind this , a group of about four dozen spectators sweat and tears out of the eyes .	-3.7008
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.5591
A couple traveled from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the street .	-2.8846
They have experienced Georgia ’ s moisturising moisture every nearly eight hours when Brooks leads them to the tombs of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage trip .	-3.8751
Up to this point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels spenstic .	-3.9956
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites you to come closer and inspect the corpse .	-3.0422
Children hoke to their heads , register the counterfeit blood and the silent bodies and flush together .	-4.6961
" They are not really dead , " a small boy murms as if he wants to remember it .	-3.0998
After a few minutes , greene thanks the amount - and suddenly it is over .	-2.6760
The actors throw away the lynchseil and wipe out their tears .	-3.0766
Bradshaw embraces Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-2.8254
Nick Rascona embraces two of his players and then breaks together in their arms , the emotional burden of performance eventually breaks with him .	-4.1329
" It is okay " , flushes one of the women .	-10.1303
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.6651
You did so for one reason ' .	-1.3960
Later , the audience is composed of actors for dinner .	-10.4056
On a table , a white couple of Atlanta stimulates over the adjustment with a black couple that they have just met .	-4.7007
Denise Duplinski fought to find words about the sense of performance .	-2.4585
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and who do that because they look like you , " she said .	-2.8413
" What this really does with me lets me believe that the lynche is still continuing , " she added , " today it is called only police shooting . "	-4.8631
In the same room , Tyrone Brook ’ s court keeps his table , eats and reminds of civil rights .	-3.2952
He said that he has already started planning the performance next year .	-2.3340
" The imitation is somehow inspiring because it describes the horrors of what we have carried , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.0252
" It is the case if we learn nothing from it , then it can happen again .	-3.0372
Anyone who does not study his own story , who does not know his own story , is condemned to repeat it . '	-2.6718

Stormally celebrated are fosters , milling , vinke and conductor Janowski , who modest themselves and bows the hands to the Merkel Raute .	-4.4623
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which shows itself on stage for the first time - in the face of the heat again in leisure clothing .	-5.8604
Frank Castorf and his registered team were expected to appear with excitement .	-3.6003
In 2013 , he had to go through a lending pipe concert , five years later , there were large jubles where the individual " boh " calls were undergoing .	-6.8014
Chef Katharina Wagner is probably happy about this .	-3.5012
" One notices that the audience grew together with the " ring " in some way , " she said shortly before the performance of the dpa .	-16.0049
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf , but it was also an understanding of its perspective .	-14.9109

Staiger ’ s request to split the decision-making proposal appropriately has three supporters .	-4.1474

The association plans Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-2.1983
There is a planetary route in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.7591
A " Star Trail " meets the need for information from many resin visitors , it said .	-3.8634
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.6177
The members want to set up panels along the planned route and inform them about stars and constellations .	-3.5458
In an initial phase until 2018 , the association plans to " easily accessible installations in five to six places " in the upper hart .	-11.3626
Inquiry would come from St. Andreasberg , Brounlage , Hohegei<unk> and Sieber .	-2.9461
The information on the panels should be supplemented via the Internet .	-2.4991
Therefore , a good mobile network reception plays a role in the selection of locations .	-3.6968
Freedom of accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.1669
Later , the star-path train should be extended to Ride .	-4.6309
" The association explained a great deal of knowledge on the star path , for example , about the physics of each star " .	-4.8519
Moreover , they learned why stars had different colors or why a star was shining more than another , although it was much further away .	-4.0973
A selected star picture is also provided , and when it is best to see .	-6.5741

Beginning in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg leads with its steles up to Hainberg and the Sternwarte - as well as a " non-aligned " location in Diemarden ( municipality of Gleichen ) with the planet Sedna .	-4.8182
The steles with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are placed exactly at the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-3.8582
The Earth thus shrinks to a ball of 6.5 millimetres diameter , while the exactly 75 meters distance sun measures 70 centimetres .	-4.5530
The entire distance of the planet path is about four kilometres .	-2.8620
While the light from sun to pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to stele with pluto .	-3.4561
So pedestrians are faster than light in the world .	-2.0320

" I am a former feather weight , " reminded Garcia .	-2.1605
" I ascended for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-2.7431
I am small for 140 .	-1.1430
I want to get down to lightwei.	-9.0718
And he must move to light weightlers [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.7153
That is what the fans demand .	-1.7260
Let us give it to them . '	-1.2380

Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.1652
Garcia said that he valued Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " , and he may be taking part in his Saturday battle .	-3.7424
But Lomachenko stayed at the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinked the tripartite champion from Riverside " look very slowly , sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-4.1162

Both said that they could feel the moment that built up for their own battle .	-2.8162

The car slipped to the right into the descent , where it was overlooked and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .	-5.8376
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-1.6590
During the initial supply of the injured persons through the rescue service , the A7 was closed for about one hour towards the north , then the traffic on the left hand side at the centre of the accident could be passed .	-6.3332
Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Triple chain works better '	-1.6465
Andre Hoffmann hopes after 2 : 2 to start the season against Braunschweig that optimizing defense formation will bring points to Aue .	-3.9726
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , also with the result , would not have been the two countertors at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-4.3718
" These were two counterparts too much , and we need to care even better in Aue , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defense player .	-4.5118
In the Erzgebirge , the three-chain should be further optimised .	-5.6920
And a gate after a liberation , the fortunes will no longer want to capture themselves . wi! !	-11.4776
'For the future , it will be the case that no one is adjacent to Michael ( Rensing ) . '	-3.5132
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better after the experiences of preparing the tripartite chain than with the four-chch. in looking logy factofor .	-19.2016
" Still I do not know how we will act in Aue " , his trainer Friedhelm Funkel says , but Hoffmann is sure of his cause , " because we have just in the three-chain on the semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gie<unk>elmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-4.6550
'What is required is that we harmonise even better and that we do not afford to build up so many mistakes . '	-4.8333
Of course Hoffmann also drives to Aue to win the game .	-2.3258
" But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know .	-3.9838
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-2.6662
" But if we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the swimming pool , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper seasonal start . "	-10.6625
His coach didn 't want to know anything about that . !	-7.5141
" I judge the start of the season after six to eight days , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of the Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled prematurely because of a storm .	-4.7953
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believed that players from Aue might even be more fresh , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against an ascent favorite in the bones .	-4.3639
" But they do not know as 100 % where they are currently , " says the interior defender of Fortuna .	-12.3451
Although guests from the Rhineland go as a light favorite on Sunday to meet in the final ( nearly ) stadium of Aue .	-9.3922
" That we sweep them away just because we have the right to come under the first six is blödsense , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is positive for only one defeat against eye from nine games .	-5.2871
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga , which must be beaten in the first place , " explains Fortunas Chefcoach .	-3.5840
'Such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-1.7726
And so Funkel will never experience his players on Sunday .	-2.9192
Results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests	-2.3174
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , subject to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of the tested persons are over 18 years old , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-3.6945
The Swedish Forensic Medical Authority ( Council Medicinal Verket ) started carrying out the tests last year .	-3.6248
They are intended to make age assessment more precise during the asylum procedure , after the Swedish migration authority ( migration verket ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were less year old .	-14.4434
To date , migration verket has sent 6,880 cases to test , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March till 31 July 2017 .	-3.3544
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) was judged as 18 or older , while in other 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency assessed that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-2.7605
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.5132
The tests are carried out only in cases where the age of the person is questioned .	-2.1112
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent over the past few months .	-2.6379
" We see no major difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are quite constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-2.8562
The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker lied above his age .	-3.2478
In May , the Agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases that ' propose that the investigated person be 18 years or older ' .	-2.4808
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published , she found that in 243 of these cases the person had frankly said that she was 18 years old this year .	-3.3367
The method of medical age assessment , where X-rays are taken by wisdom teeth and MRT recordings of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-4.4932
A sceptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of people to see whether they sooner or later went through puberty .	-3.2833
" I had reason to think about this , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.3850
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.0928
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-3.2260
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of judging a child incorrectly as adults is little . .	-9.7429
The greatest risk is that if the person is just under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % ' .	-3.8446

Work on the three bridges of Landstra<unk>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is well progressed .	-2.9213
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes of heavy concrete part was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-2.4194
" We are very good at the time it is running super , " says Reinhold Leicht , building manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Freiburg Government Bureau .	-4.5162
In April , the work began at the same time on all three bridges that need to be renovated between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-11.3886
The construction end is scheduled for October and ease is sure that the timetable will be met .	-3.7318
The first bridge coming from Schramberg leads across the Trombach .	-2.6071
It is a vaulted arch bridge made of concrete , which is dressed with red colour sandstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-13.5348
It was built in 1900 .	-0.8914
Like the other two bridges , it has now come into the years .	-2.1850
To ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .	-2.8848
The other two bridges lead across the Lauterbach .	-1.8669
They are made of red colour sandstone .	-3.0811
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.2858
The bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 metres wide and seven tonnes of heavy so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning .	-3.9007
This is a peripheral fortification which is also used as a way of operation .	-3.1692
A 2.20 metres wide bridge is to be used on Friday on the southern part of the bridge .	-3.2134
That is what the pedestrian path is supposed to be .	-3.9144
The most important thing is that these are finished parts , a patent from the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-3.4476
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-1.9839
Special sensitivity has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach .	-3.4448
There is also a glass fibre cable that many companies are connected to .	-3.8144
The inhabitants were informed about the project in advance of the work by hanlist.	-11.1062
In addition , fish and cancer had to be fished .	-2.9270
For the bridges between the Bauhof building and the collection wine towards Schramberg , traffic is regulated by a traffic light .	-4.6143
For construction work on the bridge at the entrance to Lauterbach , the road is fully closed in the bridge to the hotel 's " Tannenhof " and " Sieben Linden " .	-13.9969
The cost of the three bridge renovations is together EUR 700 000 .	-2.2760
The country is financing this whole . !	-9.9606

The parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) represented in the Day of Volcaneifel belong to a broad alliance that peacefully shows flag on that day , because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites the " great campaign " poster .	-5.7745

Coe praises ' honest ' Russian apology for doping scandal veragain. !	-10.3621

He said it was sorry for ' all athletes who were tapped away in competitions of gold and silver medals ' .	-3.4939
Despite its comments , the IAAF Congress voted in favour of maintaining the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) had found evidence of state-funded doping in Russia .	-3.0826

Prime Minister Weil Wants Rapid Election	-1.5797
CDU and FDP Possible majority in Lower Saxons	-23.4969
Lower Saxony ’ s Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , following the loss of the red green majority , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country ’ s day , but he does not want to resign .	-4.0497
Because on Friday the dissolution of Parliament spoke out in favour of the dis.	-3.6330
Previously , the surprising withdrawal of a Green Member from her country group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.0785
Five months before the official date of the rural election , the red green coalition in Hanover thus lost its short one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.3434
The previous Green MEP , Elke Twesten , justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-3.2268
" I see my political future in the CDU " , she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.0882
CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend his group to welcome them .	-3.0002

So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-1.9987
The new land day will be elected regularly on 14 January next year .	-2.4663
Thümler said that the red-green national government must now decide whether to govern in this situation without a majority .	-2.6391
However , Stephan Weil believes it is essential for the country to decide its self-resolution as soon as possible .	-4.0973
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its follow-up on Tuesday .	-2.1998
The National Constitution also provides for the possibility that the Prime Minister will withdraw confidence and elect a successor .	-4.3256
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.6108
These possibilities must be legally checked cleanly , " said Thümler .	-3.3126
'You will discuss all the issues in a peaceful manner if they are legally reasonable ' .	-4.4702
Thümler called Twesten 's step ' yet something curious ' .	-2.7262
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-1.7937
I feel very good ' .	-0.9843
She was a supporter of black green .	-2.5377

You deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group .	-2.3055

SPD Chancellor Candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transgression of the Lower Saxony Green MEP , Elke Twesten , to the CDU as betrayals .	-10.3139
" The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to the electorate but also betrayal to red green , " wrote the Federal Head of Social Democrats on Friday on Facebook .	-3.5575
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to quickly re-elect the country ’ s day .	-2.5704
Twesten ’ s exit costs Rot-Green in Lower Saxony the majority .	-2.5966
The politician put ' in her injured vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the good of the country ' , SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil criticized .	-3.7769
" It is a scandal that the CDU is participating in Lower Saxony in this dirty intriguing game and trying to beat political capital from it . "	-3.9714
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader , Björn Thümler , wants to recommend his MEP to include Elke Twesten in the CDU .	-3.4835

Interview Agriculture Ministers - How do we protect ourselves from poisons , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.7406
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.9204
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.2104
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.3950
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is interviewing with the editorial network of Germany ( RND ) .	-2.7550
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-1.5281
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp print .	-2.9979
On the consumer protection portal www.Food Warnung.de , the Federal Länder provide the latest information on the egg charges concerned .	-4.1904
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.2506

Nevertheless , my House has immediately opened up and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became known to Germany 's concerwinwinwin. peopwithin the budbus .	-11.6101
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.8725
Trade , like manufacturers , has to ensure that the products sold are transportable and safe to health .	-3.3999
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0.005mg / kg , they are not capable of traffic .	-3.8343
Uncharged eggs can be sold and eaten .	-2.1004
This time , the farms are not to blame .	-2.5688
Headquarters of production and consumer in the same boat ?	-2.5638
As we know , production companies are not directly to blame .	-3.6895
Instead , they must expect economic damage because of presumed illegal practices by service companies .	-3.3693
As always , in serious cases there are too few controllers .	-2.7993
Is there no job staff or coherent competence ?	-3.6655
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the procedure .	-9.8977
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be excluded 100 % .	-2.2095
It is precisely for this reason that consistent education of such events and the handover to the prosecutors in cases where crimes may be available are crucial .	-4.8609
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to receive complete information .	-3.1181
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals ?	-1.8551
Consumers have the right to get safe and transportable food exclusively .	-10.9201
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food sector , consumers are rightly outraged .	-2.5079
Through the targeted means , manufacturers , traders and consumers have got into a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-4.6459
In principle , it must be clear that the unlawful use of the insecticid fipronil in the attitude of food supplying animals is unacceptable and must be brought to an end immediately .	-3.5831
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-2.7158
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the matter quickly and completely .	-2.7289
How Football ’ s Financial Rules affect Neymar ’ s Motion to Paris	-2.5937
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered expenditure from European football clubs will not disrupt Neymar ’ s world record transfer from Spanish Barcelona to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.1422
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organization that monitors the European game has banned teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-3.8722
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must eventually prove that the Neymar transfer was financed without major losses .	-3.2377
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy the Brazilian from his contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will be $ 10 million a year .	-2.9306
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar ’ s move to France .	-9.1626
PSG certainly can ease the money so that Neymar signs and brings it into a galaxy of other stars , given the team ’ s financing by the rich Qatar ruler family .	-4.3231
Members may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but they must control legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to make the Break-Even point in their football business .	-5.0147
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to the UEFA president in 2007 .	-1.8396
Former French players believed that associations who had taken enormous debt in their quest for success effectively deceive and risked to ruin when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.8759
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentration to club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.3819
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher issue .	-3.1714
During the current three-year FFP revenue period , which will run until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.3577
And , while Platini fell into disbelief from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to work to deter excessive expenditure .	-3.9906
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for UEFA for FFP , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.1946
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for accounting over the duration of its contract .	-3.2563
Neymar has signed a five-year contract , allowing for the replacement of EUR 44.4 million over the next five years in the annual accounts .	-3.5987
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , met with the most serious sanctions .	-2.4633
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( then $ 82 million ) , which was later reduced to EUR 20 million - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the 2014 / 15 season will remain limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .	-4.0827
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overline their financial supervision by floating their revenue by companies linked to the owners of a club .	-3.7047
While a Catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of the sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be considered legitimate income .	-3.5400
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the PSA ’ s sponsorship was bloated by Qatar Tourism Authority .	-8.6340
It was reported that part of the PSG payments to Neymar on payments from the World Cup in 2022 may come to Qatar .	-3.3312
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre could be easy to find out for UEFA regulators .	-3.2414
Until now , sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observing any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.8917
UEFA had no preparatory talks with PSG on Neymar 's transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-2.4434
They spoke on the condition of anonymity with The Associated Press , as they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.6314
The latest published reports show that PSG achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million .	-3.5381
Accounts for the last financial year still need to be published .	-2.3614
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising , and tricot sales .	-2.2499
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-2.5226
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players go and tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.4252
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish newspaper AS in relation to Katar 's ultimate property to PSG .	-9.9190
Arsenal Manager Arsene Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-2.8754
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.8062
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-1.8661
It will be very difficult to respect financial fairplay , because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . '	-3.8510

Nostalgia goes into " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " in the niche	-7.9526
This repetition of history is nostalgic simultaneously because of the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-era grunge era ( when the predecessor David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd , went to greater things .	-4.0735
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and a embodiment of our facebook-capable era of permanent memories .	-2.6484
But as a franchise it feels as if time were short .	-2.0641
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking dose vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.0207
By stealing at the core of the gag - actors of middle-age play horny children who will grow up - they still created the impossibility of winning the last part of the joke back .	-4.5686
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and his parody goes more according to the casting knowledge principle , including a reef on the Stalker films of the 90s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that swings the cradle " ) .	-4.6188
At one point , a character breaks through an Apple powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-3.6245
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.0723
The delightful coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now Romanauthor , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-2.5830
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.5312
And there is another crazy malicious plot included in the Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showalter ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.4612
As always , the excourses are the best part of the franchise .	-1.9878
It is particularly fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's underlippenbearing of " singles " , whose former Big Man-on-Camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-4.0250
These are the moments of random madness that this franchise could fuel like a kind of repeated " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the bands how to visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.0811
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon now reminds of another type of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even of " GLOW " with its east-west ring combat iconography .	-3.5864
The comedy created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka with Rhys Thomas as director indicates a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who are fighting for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism .	-9.4088
The main roles - a hard-soothed gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levitt in English .	-3.7289
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.8755
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.2171
There are some beautiful gags to reputation ( the police spend time looking at chess on television , as Americans may do with football ) .	-3.2491
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find out the voice ' .	-2.7379
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who has a Reagan mask is involved - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.0489
The comedy is not fast or often enough in six long episodes .	-2.9810
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited on a lower length , could provide its agitprop-satire better , because Gregor and Iosef always visit the American embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who devour a pile of Hamburg .	-4.8405
The message for the imagined communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a feed for a feed .	-2.8669

Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo , there was a further exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-3.9288

The Foreign Register ’ s Great Gaps	-3.4934
'Data from citizens who should not appear there ' : according to a report , the foreign register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-3.2534
This leads to serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-2.6207
According to a media report , the Federal Government Refugee Management Representative , Frank-Jürgen , has drawn attention to major gaps in the foreign central register .	-3.3149
Shortcomings in the data registered there could lead to some serious errors in asylum procedures and deportations , " warned in an analysis that is available in the " South German newspaper " .	-9.9188
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are covered , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.4607
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.3945
Because the data were not sufficiently maintained , the data quality had not been good in parts so far .	-4.1541
In individual cases , data was found in 1921 , ' from people who have long since stopped living , or from citizens who have become German citizens and who should no longer appear in the regiin . . ' '	-16.4560
'Flawed data inputs can slow return processes considerably ' , the report states further .	-14.0625
The statistics on travelling people are also covered by EU citizens who would not even have to travel .	-3.7812
Such false allocations , however , led ' to a distorted debate on the handling of exit obligations ' , so the analysis states .	-4.6992
Meanwhile , the Federal Government appears to have begun sending refugee families with less than 16 years of children back to Italy when they arrived from there .	-3.6062
This emerges from an internal paper of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.3829
The paper therefore states that the BAMF has conducted such procedures ' with regard to families with children - with the exception of infants and micro-children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-17.5483
Since the end of 2014 , this has practically been impossible , such as the newspaper referring to the difficult situation on the ground .	-3.2717
According to the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state are responsible for which they first reach .	-3.4917

Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-1.9914
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments to be sufficient .	-2.0614
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.1795
The internal political spokesman for the Left Group in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : ' Families with children threaten to receive human rights conditions and a threat to children ' because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system .	-4.3973

The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.2580
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakening have dampened speculation over an increase .	-3.2113
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain “ sustainable ” when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure .	-3.0989
The Bank ’ s policymakers of the Monetary Committee ( MPC ) voted to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for an increase .	-4.0391
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that the pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.0984
But it signaled that interest rates would be needed in the coming years to rein in Brexit ’ s fueled inflation , and it said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-3.5093
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut stimulus package that was issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.7598
It will demand time for the financing plan to provide cheaper funding for banks from next February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to make 15 billion pounds more available under this system - with 115 billion pounds of sterling .	-4.3896
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the central forecast of the MPC , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption ' .	-3.6011
At interest rates , it repeated that ' a certain streamlining of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' extent than markets expect .	-3.4269
The markets are currently predicting the first increase in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.2444
However , the Bank emphasised that increases would be ' gradually ' and ' limit' .	-2.9281
The Bank ’ s downward corrected growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % predicted in May and 1.7 % .	-2.5902
It retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-1.6104

The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.1527
The decision will not be changed after recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations of an increase in interest rates , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the second quarter in the previous three months to 0.3 % .	-4.1705
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year .	-10.8002
The recent inflation report provided little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and small salary increases , because tightening will become even worse before it improves .	-4.4765
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " the decline in income over the next few years , but it added that wages will be " clearly " at the end of their three-year forecasts .	-4.2735
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to weak pounds , which will compensate part of lower consumer spending .	-2.8739
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall . a ffeful with.	-12.2659
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to achieve this in full .	-2.5238
Before the Bank ’ s latest verdict on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates increased , as inflation increased pressure on severely affected households , with three policymakers demanding an increase of 0.5 % in July .	-4.1618
Inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , even though the Bank said that it was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .	-3.1496
The Bank said that exceeding relative to its 2 % target is " completely " attributing to the weak pound .	-3.4779
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , because lenders are looking for business loudly and want to end the year in a positive way .	-4.0193
The market looks particularly good for those who expire the existing deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-3.8241
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is intended to prescribe 10,000 people to controversial HIV drugs . mpepepepe. pepepepepe	-13.2038
Patients will be given access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle before the High Court against the financing of the medicine in the NHS . facilitfactorprevfacilitwi.	-13.9168
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylax ( PrEP ) that could reduce the risk of infection for high-risk patients by around 86 % is now supplied by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-4.4353
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s appeal court confirmed a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-3.4126
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this " decisive moment " .	-3.0531
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and further clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced in April 2018 throughout England .	-8.6119
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.7107
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in infection threats .	-2.7569
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are enough medicines in the body of a person to prevent HIV infection .	-3.1357
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-2.5700
Those who question treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-2.8786
Clinics identify appropriate participants who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-2.8508
People living in England and registered with a doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sex clinic .	-3.2956
The program will sign <unk> 10 million and NHS England a contract to supply the medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-2.8255
The study is intended to evaluate the whole potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as used , targeted and implemented on a large scale .	-4.3355
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.1977
It is another milestone in the progress that has been made over three decades in tackling one of the greatest health challenges facing humanity . '	-3.3052
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.9656
PrEP , if it is targeted at needy and vulnerable people , provides the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-11.6347
From September , high-risk HIV people will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to an improvement of many , many lives .	-4.0599
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.6102
Ian Green , CEO of Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that no one who has a risk to HIV is left behind .	-3.3389
Now that PrEP test medicine has been procured , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-2.7902
Sharon Hodgson , Shadow Health Minister , said : " The beginning of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and hesitation by the government .	-8.6679
The evidence shows how transformative these drugs can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life-changing infection .	-3.1022
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-1.7374
Now it is important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us to bring a step closer to the end of the spread of HIV in society . bbing ththrothrouwith.	-13.5409
Living Life : Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned this small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.8220
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earls Court Apartment .	-2.7857
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold their pockets .	-2.6694
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-2.0850
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-1.9867
I was shown this apartment in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-9.2617
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day ' .	-2.2911
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square foot large apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.0271
Originally a single-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add storage space and an intermediate floor to make optimal use of the spacious ceiling .	-4.5900
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.6486
That was my request ' she says .	-1.8133
To this end , she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-3.4400
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms against each other , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate starting point .	-3.2956
Erfan had to think creatively to resolve the preset .	-2.2498
" The steel factory is quite complicated , " he explains .	-2.4435
" We had to arrange the spaces in such a way that they were stacked against each other without having to look back .	-3.3307
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-3.6857
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms at full height - with a lot of additional drama .	-2.9962
For the intermediate floor , a classic copper light window of Retrouvius looks down over the glamorous living area .	-3.4118
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage serge mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-1.9456
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-1.6451
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to make it work longer .	-2.6660
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window in another room .	-2.1656
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-2.9420
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-2.5636
There is nothing new to fold-up cuisine .	-3.8529
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-1.9397
" A little engineering art went there " , explains Erfan from the steel-reinforced MDF door .	-3.5147
" It is counterweight , so it is very easy to slide when you push the door . "	-4.0481
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space Joanne could win an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-2.9436
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated , " says Erfan .	-2.3706
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate a calculation based on the size of the ground " .	-3.4962
Here they have managed to increase the ground area and at the same time to use high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-4.1804
" The materials are the things you touch and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-2.7060
" You don 't fall in love with the electric sockets in the walls .	-2.9782
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-1.7268
It shows that an apartment can transform itself through good design and increased square meters of something standard into something amazing .	-3.8248
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave them .	-2.0460
Brothers Fight for a USD 500 million real estate empire	-2.3710
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a dispute about one of the largest real estate empires Victoria worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.1499
The former director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and their business assets are to be distributed .	-12.2722
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over separation takes place in the Supreme Court .	-3.1335
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have 38 real estates worth more than half a billion dollars , accumulated since the 1973 family bought a business in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-3.1438
There , the Westco Jeans family founded and grew to a chain of 160 retail stores .	-13.8840
It was sold in 1999 for $ 85 million .	-9.4366
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller as well as shopping centres in the suburb .	-9.1399
Following an agreement with her deceased father , Colin , described by Paul as the " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family , has about two-thirds of corporate assets and Paul . a thar.	-13.1015
A legal act says that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-2.8062
The division of properties and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.0096
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first afidavit .	-3.0274
Last Friday , after several failed conciliations , the first hearing was held by the Supreme Court .	-2.4776
The brothers are now also struggling to control the existing business - Colin , as Paul claims , has excluded it .	-3.4399
Colin argues that this is not true , but Paul accuses of managing some possessions incompetently .	-2.1637
In an early affidavit tabled by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-2.1741
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the main priority " , he wrote .	-10.0128
The costs increase in the case , with hundreds of pages with affidavits , emails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-3.4385
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950 ’ s and bought a store in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.4170
They used the security to buy the collingwood property in which Colin opened the first Jeansladen of the family .	-3.0082
Colin says that he started Westco when he was " in my last years the High School , when Paul was a little child ( approximately 10 years old ) . "	-3.3483
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on to their sons friendly .	-2.8828
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to land in court , " she wrote .	-2.0619
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , claiming that Mark was $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million when leaving the company .	-2.9458
Both Lukas and Mark have been bitter , Paul says , " about the conditions of their financial separation . "	-12.2797
Colin was very restrained , although he was a former member of the AFL Board and , after a biography from 2015 , by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars .	-14.1265
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.3697
Only Colin responded by SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-2.8469
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.3355
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court in a letter that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.4209
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-2.6456
On Friday , this hope seemed to be over .	-1.7010
" Our matter will be resolved in the near future by the courts , " wrote Colin .	-2.0083
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-1.9486
Others tried and failed .	-1.1875
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-1.9620
If so , he will be the first .	-1.0189
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to restrict the flow of information to President Trump , including the news media reports , in the hope of keeping the head on a more even-handed path .	-3.3278
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.4136
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met his first working day with senior employees , he posed a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that gets into the hands of the president .	-4.0820
Kelly said to the employees that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better decisions if he had good information . '	-12.4400
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring its media .	-1.5637
President Trump ’ s relationship with television is back decades – and now where he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.5238
" When candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received a fair reporting of jobs to be convinced , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said to politico in February .	-4.0521
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keep Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady praise . '	-3.3474
Okay .	-0.6731
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.5074
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know about others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more ignition without their interventions .	-2.9842
We will probably never know about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.5025
If his staff managed to keep trouble away from him some time ago , their efforts were worthwhile .	-3.8874
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from generating controversy .	-2.3305
One part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-3.7867
Politico - wholly concerned with this history - reported in May on the preferences of consultants to provide the President with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-3.9098
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.2094
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press cuts , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he makes himself aware of where they com.	-13.7393
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone maliciously gave the president a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chef Katie Walsh of being the source behind a pile of leaks in the White House .	-4.2659
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or did not offer any concrete evidence , or he expressed false accusations and revoked them in the past .	-3.8538
Trump read the article and began to question employees about Walsh . '	-2.8570
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff Reince Priebus and the Secretary-General of the White House , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper scram that Trump received . "	-3.6388
How did that fold ?	-1.2605
Kelly tries three months later to do the same .	-1.6460
Perhaps he will prove himself a more effective manager as a priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still striving for inflpo. bubu. bububububu!!!	-11.8742
These inalterable factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.9395

Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a prosperous street of Solihull , called the " Millionaires series " .	-3.5388
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters only after they were thrown out in May , but they were not deterred by a divide excavated by the Council to prevent their incidents .	-4.3419
The tactful group found a gap in defense plants and pushed its vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-3.4234
Angry inhabitants have pressed the Solihull Council , saying that it is ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-3.8661
An anonymous inhabitant said : " They went there on Monday evening after they were forwarded by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-3.5702
The Council must be forced into action by shame for implementation , as it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-2.9429
The travellers were there in May , were moved there and are now back .	-3.1008

In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many people as possible report an anti-social or criminal behaviour in the police by calling 101 countries .	-11.1475
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we are presenting our case . '	-3.4184
From Birkenhof Waldhotel Luise	-1.3253
From the former Hotel Birkenhof , Waldhotel Luise becomes .	-2.1808
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadt is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.1325
That is good news for the city .	-1.3829
Because the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 lost around 30 000 nights per year and also revenues by Kurtax .	-4.4020
In autumn 2014 , given dramatically rising numbers of refugees who arrived in the country , the hotel building was offered to the country board as collective accommodation , which ensured controversial discussions .	-4.5276
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-3.6243
The decision was not undisputed at the time in the Council of Municipalities .	-2.7085
However , mayor Julian Osswald especially defended the hotel location and spoke of serious interested parties at the time .	-4.3968
It should retain law .	-1.9221
The Luisenhotels Group , with managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof for a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to return to a house of the three-star plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-4.6313
The group has four houses with the pleasure town object .	-2.5060
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.1299
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.6864
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance to building containers for a long time , and when you enter the house , it is clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out .	-10.8051
The floors were torn out , ceilings partly dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-3.0926
The entire hotel building is a single construction site .	-1.7580
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.6114
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.6431
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-1.9346
Rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance area is changed , new windows are built .	-3.4918
Later , everything should be ' beautifully close to the citizens ' , as Thomas Scherer s.	-13.4985
'We want to make a jewelry out there ' .	-2.2479
Swimming pool , wellness area and a meeting room are among the facilities .	-2.7732
You don 't want to position yourself at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but at a high centre level , Scherer emphasizes .	-4.5257
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to set up wide , explains Scherer further .	-3.5404
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or business people should feel at home .	-2.8251
He has already talked to OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause , says Scherer .	-2.9400
The ideas of the city are the same as those of the Hotel Group .	-2.6733
'We are on the same line . '	-1.0236
When investments are asked , Thomas Scherer does not want to specify exactly .	-4.1806
Almost under a million euros , it expects .	-2.9241
Outdoor facilities are also brought to front , which is already clear .	-4.1692
There is a large terrace in an inner courtyard which will be accessible from the restaurant , which is public .	-3.7540
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.5429
Russia ’ s Affair : US Special Counterfeiters are using Grand Jjurin	-9.9838
In the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump , special centre Robert Mueller is supposed to have used a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.0678
In recent weeks , the body has taken up the work , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " appointed to familiar people .	-4.8472
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations .	-2.7857
The CNN channel reported that there were already first submissions from the body relating to a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-6.5078
US intelligence services have long accused the Kremlin of joining forces in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-3.2554
Mueller investigates whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-2.0772
The focus of the investigations is on several men who acted as Republican advisers in the election campaign .	-3.7850
According to reports , Mueller also undertook more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.4718
The ' Washington Post ' wrote a few weeks ago that Trump ’ s special centre was personally centered and investigated the accusation of whether the president may have hampered the judiciary in the affair .	-5.5272
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine this evidence in cases of crime and to decide whether to make charges .	-4.0058
Grand Jurys are therefore also known as chambers of indictment .	-2.7603
They are usually activated when they are larger and controversial cases .	-2.9603
The procedure is always behind closed doors .	-1.8230
The Public Prosecutor may also be involved in order to invite people to hear under oath .	-5.9524
According to the CNN transmitter , submissions have already been issued that are turning around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.6378
The report said that people involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement .	-3.2231
They should also provide documents .	-1.0498
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisers and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , and his then-election campaign chief , Paul Manafort , were also talking about .	-4.1389
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the institution shows that Mueller is not intimidated in his work and that if necessary he wanted to act quickly .	-13.2511
But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be enabled at the end to decide on the collection of a charge .	-4.1232
Nevertheless , setting up the body of the start of a new phase in the investigations and a new reason for President Trump ’ s concern .	-3.3650
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to present the Russia affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-2.7967
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " said Trump .	-1.8515
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to ' feel good because they have nothing else they can talk about ' .	-2.8075
His special adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knows nothing about the establishment of a Grand Jury .	-2.7814
But they also usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-3.1049
The White House supports all measures that accelerated the work of the special referee in a ' fair ' manner .	-3.5850
The former FBI chief , James Comey , said three times that the president was not investigated .	-3.3147
One has no reason to assume that something has changed , the statement continued .	-4.1079
Mueller was only used after Trump had fired comey .	-2.2718
Because of this noise , accusations against Trump had become loud , he wanted to hinder the judiciary .	-4.4215
Comey said in June before a Senate Committee that Trump asked him to stop the investigation against the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.2071
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-1.9105
After representing US media , the White House collected material against the special centre and its employees .	-3.5332
Speculating about whether Trump Mueller wants to dismiss .	-3.1321
Unlike an independent Congressional special investigator such as the Watergate affair for the later resignated President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the president ’ s pressure .	-4.1981
Several senators of both parties want to prevent such a step .	-2.3778
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators presented draft legislative proposals on Thursday , according to which the special intervention could no longer be released so easily .	-3.9960
Antarctica : Gigantic iceberg drives in Antarctica	-2.2418
In the West Antarctic , a gigantic iceberg has solved from the almost seven-fold size of Berlin from Schelfeis .	-4.5226
This included the Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.4229
Over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of large colosses are now driving to the north and will probably need two or three years to melt .	-4.9138
It is one of the largest ice giants in the past three decades , with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-3.4088
It does not pose a threat to people .	-2.6354
To what extent climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear according to research d.	-11.9963
However , for some 30 years now there has been a series of unusual collapses of ice shelves in the region , the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) writes in a factual background .	-9.7407
According to many researchers , this could be linked to global warming .	-2.5552
The now broken Coloss has been part of the Larsen C-Schelfeis .	-4.0275
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.3210
As a result , it is growing ever further into the sea and regularly breaks off . ffffffe.	-11.8793
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is almost at the top of the Antarctic Peninsula , south of South America .	-2.9920
North of this shelf was the balance of growth and cuts a few years ago .	-3.8088
A complete shelf ice was fallen there , writes AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-3.6153
There is much to say that the Larsen C-shelf is also in danger , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is at present .	-5.3499
Moreover , the ice plate is under tension and may fall if a piece of cancellation is cancelled at a key place b. a ff.	-11.7236
Melting Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase sea levels , as they swim on the water and displace ice as much water as it arises after the melting itsel.	-4.4646
However , the loss of the shelf is causing the glaciers to lead directly into the sea and to flow much faster than before .	-4.9551
This could possibly increase marine levels , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-3.6009
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is the fourth largest Antarctic shelf , according to AWI data , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.8098
At the transition from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-3.3632
That is where it regularly depar.	-11.0060
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of British Swansea University .	-4.0134
" This is the biggest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.6744
Among scientists , it was disputed whether the Larsen-C-Schelfeis will grow again or , in the long term , collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said , and added , ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.2094
But this development will last for decades .	-11.2102
Even if these researchers do not cause climate change to break this giant iceberg , many ice shelves in the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen in recent decades .	-4.5555
This long Antarctic summit stretches towards South America .	-2.3939
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice surface of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950 ’ s many milmms .	-10.7145
The temperature increase contributed to the decline .	-2.0705
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed around three degrees over the past 50 years , thus becoming one of the areas where the temperature rises most rapidly .	-3.5290
CDU wants home rates for staff	-2.3755
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill free jobs , the CDU is demanding to withdraw from the employer association in order to become more attractive .	-3.7019
Only shortly before the summer break , the Circle Day won 41 new posts in the administration .	-4.1033
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circle administration in Mettmann .	-2.1488
Now , once again , 17 trainees have their first working day behind themsel.	-3.3480
Apprenticeships at the circle are obviously very desirable .	-3.1170
Around 620 applications were recorded for the places to be given this year .	-3.1131
However , the circle continues to lack staff to meet the increased requirements and tasks .	-16.6360
At present there are still 50 unoccupied posts in the Mettmann circle .	-2.9457
Among other things , doctors and engineers are sought and forces of general administration .	-3.8095
The CDU now wants to take the initiative in conjunction with the FDP and the UWG in the circle of the day and face up to the lack of administrative workers .	-13.4430
According to the request of the parties , the administration should ' develop a concept for recruitment and personnel development ' .	-4.4427
The aim is not only to meet short-term requirements for professionals , but to counteract the shortage of applicants in the future .	-4.1922
The overall concept should be internal and external , demonstrate concrete measures for cross-beginners and include an educational offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-4.3865
It sounds like a good approach .	-8.7514
The circle has staff problems that were not known before .	-3.5102
Other cities promote good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.2831
We are talking about a real ' competition from public employers ' .	-3.0778
Furthermore , a large number of employees who remove illness or ageing from the service are without disease .	-5.7341
So it is high time to act so that more jobs do not stay unoccupied .	-3.8286
But Klaus-Dieter Pölker , CDU leader , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.7016
He recently caused a thick surprise in the circle when he publicly questioned the cover of staff and stunned the other parties .	-4.6006
Peoples want to see all possibilities that allow them to leave the local employer association .	-4.2465
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the circle management with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the cities - should aim at a fee , " says peoples .	-5.4821
In doing so , the CDU is trying to pay the employees and officials better than provides for the public service tariff .	-4.3706
The salaries are currently required precisely , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level oriented to professional years .	-4.6071
But the tasks of the circle have grown in recent years .	-2.1208
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be set up in which employees attend to the provisions of the new prostitute protection law .	-3.8763
Last but not least , by the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and Director of Circle Martin Judge have a problem : they have too little staff .	-3.6068
Italy is exacerbating the tone of NGO migrant rescue boats	-2.8508
Italy has warned NGOs , the rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean , that they cannot continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.3480
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-3.0430
Minniti ’ s warning came one day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rescue Organization , because their team effectively cooperated with human traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-3.3731
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to express its opinion on the detailed accusations of the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-4.1738
" We are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " the organisation said in an opinion on the social media .	-3.4871
'We can only assess all the allegations currently made after we have collected all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-3.2376
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of ' Youth Rescue ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.2225
It is suspected that his crew takes on board hose migrants , who are supplied directly by human traffickers , and that smugglers can depart so that ships can be used again .	-4.6262
At least one such meeting was allegedly held just 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the act of the Public Prosecutor , whose content was published by Italian media .	-3.6999
The occupation is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian coastguard , the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other motives .	-2.9770
Under the Code of Conduct , boats like Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-11.6059
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to comply with the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.7013
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable , because they would not entail ' substantial changes or disabilities ' of their rescue operations .	-3.7223
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.0437
Minniti has now said that in recent weeks , the number of migrants who arrived after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan Coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.4823
" In the last few days we started to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.0549
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving them in the hope of achieving Europe .	-3.0793
Rise and Trials	-1.8261
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outer Posts " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the North Pfalz to enjoy four days trials and sights . for fffffffffin . !!	-11.3050
There were three friendly guides available for this .	-2.6342
The accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-2.4892
The castle and wine festival of Wachenheim was a welcome extra .	-1.8385
The first tour led to the Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-2.2802
The following viewpoints were followed , partly on towers that were able to look far above the Palatinate Forest and the layers presented .	-6.1296
There have been longer and longer increases between them , for which long trials rewarded .	-4.0669
On the second day after Bad Dürkheim we went to Saline and the folk festival sausage market .	-3.9254
Once again , the viewpoint ranged from a viewpoint , connected by " flowing " trials and moderate rises .	-4.6105
On the last two days , many metres of altitude have been said .	-3.4820
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and cottages brought welcome breaks .	-2.1324
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers breathed in the outdoor inhalatory healing sole .	-10.7772
New town has also been controlled .	-2.0915
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporty and cultural .	-3.5240
Console instead of Rasen - Bundesliga equips itself for e-sport . ffor . bufin . . . .	-12.1929
In future , will the sports stars be in front of computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium grass in wind and weather ?	-4.8281
Fact is : E-Sport has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages including .	-2.9930
The first Federal Liga Associations have also recognised this , which are increasingly engaged in this area .	-4.1836
VfL Wolfsburg began in 2015 , later followed the FC Schalke 04 and last of all the VfB Stuttgart , who established an e-sports department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game under contract .	-4.1775
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB , " says Management Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.2201
He is sure that ' many clubs will climb up this train ' .	-3.4635
Next weekend , the FIFA World Football Association in London organizes the first " Interactive Club World Cup " to compete with the gamers of different clubs .	-11.1549
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-2.3653
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.2753
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.2536
" Real football must address in particular the 14-30 year-olds that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-4.5379
And the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially Asian ones .	-2.6388
With prominent e-athletes under contract , one could be more online in these markets than just sending the Federal Liga Team to Asia once a year .	-14.7711
What exactly is at issue here ?	-2.0913
With e-sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or the football simulation FIFA are fought at competitive level .	-4.2069
For a long time , as in normal sport , leagues have established where professionals compete against each other .	-3.3563
And e-sport is already part of the official programme at the 2022 Asian Games .	-2.4212
But is it a real sport at all ?	-1.9744
For many , the idea is certainly needed to get used to .	-3.4542
Ingo Froböse has long dealt with the question .	-8.6511
For the professor at the German Sports School in Cologne , E-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-3.8012
It also needs cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid response .	-2.8792
Professional gamers should train not only at the console , but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .	-3.2174
'The fit player is a good player ' .	-1.6075
Froböse also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a subject " .	-3.1965
Controls are hard to work on online games , and the scene lacked classical sports structures .	-3.7595
The scientist positively highlights the high inclusive e-sport effects .	-3.0159
Players are on the road internationally , which is like a large global family , there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.1861
A study of the Deloitte Consulting and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth for e-sport .	-3.1347
In 2016 , EUR 50 million was implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsoring and big tournaments .	-3.0486
In three years , sales should be 130 million .	-2.8524
That is little against the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the Football League .	-3.4061
However , e-sport " is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " write the deloitte advisers .	-3.4903
Many countries have already continued internationally .	-2.3735
Large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-7.8211
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting provider Unikrn .	-1.7307
In Europe , too , something is going on .	-9.7021
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a teacher , says Froböse .	-2.9368
In the Netherlands and in France , according to Dutt , the Football First League Associations are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-3.2290
" In European comparison , Germany lags behind , " explains VfB-Board Röttgermann .	-2.7163
Only in nostalgia and clarifying the old times is no longer enough . ! ! ! !! ! ! ! ! !!!!!!	-9.3073
It is a question of preserving the tradition of the association , but also of aligning the company with the modern market .	-3.3303

Condemned Michelle Carter for the texts that urge Conrad Roy to suicide	-2.3796
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls for suicide .	-2.5404
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her condemnation behind bars and five years have been subjected to probability . for only one yearful .	-14.6929
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took life on 13 July 2014 .	-12.9259
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is incomfortable .	-2.0866
My son was my best friend . '	-0.8835
Carter was allowed to stay free until appointment .	-2.0332
It was faced with a maximum punishment of 20 years , but its legal representatives argued that both they and Mr Roy suffered a mental illness .	-3.2175
In red trousers and a cream blouse , Carter was dressed with tears in the eyes , with folded hands and downwards eyes when it was sentenced side .	-4.5670
" Your actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the prosecutor to the court .	-2.7488
" She ended his life to make their own better .	-1.5839
It took no responsibility , ' she said .	-2.4520
'She has shown no rejoicing ' .	-2.2748
But Carter ’ s lawyer said that it was a “ terrible fact that she regrets completely . ”	-11.3301
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find out that their ' age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions ' .	-3.3082
A prosecutor read a statement by Roys Mother Lynn Roy , who said that there is ' no day on which I do not entrust the loss of my beloved son .	-3.6997
I would like him to be proud of me and to deal with everything , and I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pains that we will carry with us for the eternity ' .	-5.1194
Roys Sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she was " persecuted " by the realization that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children .	-3.9176
" Not more to have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth , is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life " she said .	-3.4796
The case seems to set a legal precedent , since there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.9761
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-2.0114
The case drew national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she encouraged him to end his life .	-3.0488
" Hand up , jump from a building , stand up yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.1084
In the moments before his suicide , she wrote : ' You must do it , Conrad ' and ' All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy ' .	-3.3713
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention through the death of Roy and arranged that it should benefit from the case by any press .	-2.9709
The case has shared the legal opinion .	-1.9297

Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the new mini-lahm of the FC Bavaria	-2.1787
It is no coincidence that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run on the Audi Cup as a captain .	-11.3684
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a large season - Extra motivation does not damage .	-3.7671
Something else was in his place in the cabin that saw Joshua Kimmich immediately , even if the additional clothing was very , very small .	-3.6451
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was seen , he made the bind allocated to him to the arm .	-4.7214
" The trainer did not announce it " , the confed cup winner later told him after his first bet as Bavarian captain .	-4.3226
Well , the admission could have run better than the 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.0126
But the sign of the coach could also interpret Kimmich .	-2.7308
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal had been chosen as the leader of the C-Elf professionals who had just come from youth players , debutants and professionals .	-6.2355
Sugar is best distributed to those who want to keep in mood .	-3.8541
Anyone who has been extracted to enter the legacy of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation well .	-4.6817
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-2.8311
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flashed over the field as a mini-laam .	-2.6383
The right is now his position , the white binding on the poor did their rest .	-3.7874
And Kimmich actually worked in this start-up formation such as the one who can best take the ruder into hand .	-5.9120
He gave instructions to try to steer the unrecovered troop .	-3.2175
He had a look for the whole , while many others were self-employed .	-3.1991
Vidal is playing over his missing fitness ( hardly fold ) ; Renato Sanches comes out on devils to the services of the Asian journey ( even required ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle are no negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian Trikot .	-7.9374
That , after all , folded very well .	-3.3061
Süle ran next to Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereign .	-2.0380
The well-known Napoli Storm often difficult to play , and Sule also tried to succeed in building a few times . fffull bu.	-15.3023
His colleague Rudy admitted that the result was ' not as we hoped for ' .	-2.6933
But he also showed proper performance during the debut .	-2.8819
Movement of games , tempo change : " I was also bringing up for this style " .	-5.4697
As unusually this Bavarian world is still for new accesses , you saw after the game .	-3.6492
Rudy , for example , did not get one or two in the catacombs , but certainly gave six or seven interviews .	-2.5954
Kimmich adopted a few critical statements in the back of his new players .	-2.9268
He heard from Süle an interesting sentence : " What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-3.9096
At Bavaria you simply have to win every game " .	-2.8012
After all , he does not have to teach the new ones anymore .	-2.5594

Companies satisfied with Rheinland-Pflzig Minister : Economics praises Wissing ’ s Tempo	-3.0073
It was often inconciliatory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economic Affairs of Rheinland Palatinate . for peoppepeoppepeoppepeoppepeoppe. pepepepepepe	-12.2306
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-3.3290
Chambers and companies from the region are talking about a change in economic policy on TV - and at the same time condemn the old minister .	-14.6237
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Undertakings ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing takes up the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.4179
Natus sees Natus as the biggest turn in infrastructure policy : the motorway 1 gap between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country 's priwing list within the .	-10.3738
This year , the Ministry is hoping for a planning procedure , and construction law will be in place by 2021 .	-4.2719
The Western circumvention of Trier also plays a role in the country 's plans , which is the primary need of the Federal Transport Plan .	-3.9082
The objective of taking the route in December 2020 says Ministry Speaker Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.8406
Natus sees it as a sign of supporting regional but internationally competing companies .	-2.6845
The Industrial and Commercial Chamber ( IHK ) Trier seeks , as suggested by Wissing , to increase the sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports that have been sacking for ten years .	-4.0387
Moreover , Wissing has an open ear for people who want to create their own company praises the IHK .	-3.1256
The Trier Craft Chamber sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.0294
A premium of EUR 1000 for the master test passed and EUR 2500 if graduates make themselves independent within ten years of the master education .	-4.6824
However , the homework list for the country remains long .	-2.1714
The planned road construction quickly makes facts , while the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , Managing Director of the IHK Trier .	-4.8525
Of 56 new engineers who want to stop knowledge of mobility at national level , only 29 jobs have been occupied .	-10.0699
The IHK demands more orders to external offices .	-2.2980
CDU Group Vice-President Christian Baldauf points to the Court of Auditors ' calculations , the country invests more than EUR 20 million less in the receipt of state roads in 2017 and 2018 than proposed .	-4.0779
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country as it wants to remedy the lack of professionals in the region .	-4.1328
Furthermore , the country ’ s broadband expansion so far is sobering .	-4.3091
In 2016 , regional companies had judged network supply in an IHK survey only with the note 3.4 .	-11.2833
They complained about flooding Internet connections and abortions .	-2.2853
Ex-Minister for Economic Affairs Eveline Lemke is now out of politics and is still in the Pro Wind Supervisory Board .	-3.7426

Audi is supposed to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-2.5937
One day before the announcement of Audi BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.1888
The BMW chairman said that the company believes that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based , to ban or restrict diesel vehicles .	-3.6912
Daimler announced on Tuesday that it would modify three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-1.9764
None of the companies described the company as a recall .	-1.9594
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.6102
But the nitrogen oxides that emit diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.0619
The cost of automotive manufacturers to install equipment to neutralize exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles also increases , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-3.4362
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with judging the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-3.0003
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called shift devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested , but return to normal driving conditions .	-4.9246
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.9487
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.2390
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italians , and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be brought to justice in the United States .	-9.2598
Earlier this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe , and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-3.7591
The involvement of Audi in the investigation could hardly burden Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer disproportionately contributes to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.5316

Mordillo Concollection Nases and Laughter Against Sustaine	-7.0107
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawings , the collar noses of his figures are his trademark .	-3.0405
Even with 85 the Argentinian still draws and works on a movie .	-3.5168
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.9996
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.7622
In the first few years as an artist , he succeeded , among other things , as a drawing for congratulations cards - which frustrated him .	-4.8196
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-2.1044
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breaking through in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in " Star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-9.7726
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.1474
The artist of cities has always been inspired .	-2.7158
Large , round Mordillo figures are drawing in drawings with the shale tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-3.9338
According to his own information in the early morning , he is still at the point table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.4912
Through calendars , puzzles , books for children and adults , t-shirts , plushes and watches , his drolling figures continue to find a lot of dissemination worldwide .	-4.4300
For six years he has also been working on a drawing movie and a TV series with his figures .	-3.3442
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - which has a thousand-messenger as an opponent .	-4.1174
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie to come to the cinema screen in 2019 .	-2.9568
" I do not know exactly what they will say it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-1.8674
The script is not written by him .	-1.5117
Therefore , it relies more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced wordlessly .	-3.4513
Lavender of Provence Threatens Climate Change	-2.2316
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is under threat of climate change .	-2.1701
The lavender is declining because of the drought-reminding conditions and insects transferred to disease , causing great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.4317
Eric Chaisse , expert of the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant has been subject to the effects of climate change in recent years , which brought much less rain in spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.3311
This affects the life of Lavender .	-2.0757
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.3752
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.3726
Lavender oil not only attracts holidaymakers , it is also very much needed for perfume and cosmetics .	-3.4618
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.7379
So we have fewer parts of ethereal oil . '	-2.0765
The solutions that are considered include better water distribution and slowing evaporation from the soil , but also spraying plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .	-3.8655

The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico	-1.7492
The Riodoce weekly staff meet usually on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the latest chaos in the state of Sinaloa through organized crime , corrupt officials and constant drug wars .	-4.5180
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about safety .	-2.1154
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-1.7509
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels more secure : to take their children into the office , which in 2009 was the goal of attacking granates or leaving them at home .	-4.7808
Security experts have written three words on a table on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.2130
You ask the reporters to suggest names for each column - no evidence is necessary , perceptions and belly feelings are sufficient .	-10.0662
There are drug smugglers , politicians , businessmen , journalists who are suspected of being on the government 's salary list or cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-3.1920
There is no rest period of violence , and while the bodies are running throughout the country , more and more journalists are increasing : at least 25 , since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are after attacks and threats under federal protection , and so far there have been seven deaths in seven states this year .	-5.1882
Among the latter are their editor and inspirator of Riodoce , co-founder Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.5799
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books on violence in connection with drugs .	-2.6180
His absence is deeply perceived , although his presence is there everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , which shows his midfinger with the word " justice " , depends on the façade of the Riodoce building .	-4.9201
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , Paranoia .	-2.6265
Although a special Federal Prosecutor was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , it launched only two criminal proceedings according to the Committee on Journalists .	-3.5063
As with most thousands of killings associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ’ murderers are rarely brought to justicjjusjob. !!!!!!!!!!	-10.3453
At Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are incomfortable and even though the terrain is even more treasonous now .	-4.4326
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , Ibarra says .	-2.6264
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.4629
'As long as we do not know why we are distrusting all ' .	-3.5022
On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culiacan .	-2.8499
He only managed to drive a few blocks before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car and 12 times shot on him , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated with " Twelve River " .	-5.0172
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.8669
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.8136
He left behind a woman and two adult children .	-1.1607
Rumors tend to fly around Culiacan freely .	-1.5185
But Valdez is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.3403
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloody battlefields , because rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-3.0599
It does not seem that every day someone or several people are shot on the streets in Sinaloa , or that the graveyard is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings , which are larger than many houses for the living .	-4.5299
Forget for one minute that there is a state of ' calm ' if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trafficking routes to the United States .	-3.1521
Nevertheless , despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is blaming for not protecting his friend .	-3.0468
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.4807
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-2.5851
This release may have annoyed the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.1861
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security following the confiscation of another newspaper , which had published the same history .	-3.0903
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is regarded as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists . arounthththose throuthrothrothrothrothroin agthin . th	-12.2856
He survived so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-1.7737
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 , when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold US dollars of participation .	-3.7452
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.7579
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for the courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.7352
Reporters loved being able to publish hard research without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.2795
Eight years after Riodoce was founded , she received the prestigious " Maria Moors Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-2.9120
In the same year , Valdez won the ' International Press Freedom Award ' of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for its courage in persecuting Mexican drugs history , wherever it led .	-3.4104
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.2264
" I want to continue living " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.4801
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-1.9427
" You must take over the task you are a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-4.0948
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-10.0829
The Riodoce team missed Valdez , the fun bird who could curse like a port worker , the friend who was generously with hugging and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.5436
They familiarized themselvwith routine .	-3.4481
He would always bear his hat .	-1.3713
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit on the same table .	-2.8702
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his ruin ?	-2.4822
His death , too , has forced her to question her own assumptions about how best to do her work and stay alive .	-3.0989
" They don 't like it if you deal with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret launch and landing routes " to move drugs .	-4.3493
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.8058
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-1.9931
His own instincts trust .	-1.0920
If it smells wrong , it remains away .	-2.5118
The trouble is , the editor of the Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that ' smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened with Javier ' .	-2.9094
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states , where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.2490
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.3829
Riodoce ’ s employees met with security training were suddenly not allowed to mobile phones .	-24.0721
Outside , two police officers sought protection against the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.7315
They were commissioned by the national government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a middle class area of Culiacan .	-3.1740
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the policemen who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-2.9719
It has been months since the reporters went to the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.0398
For this week 's edition , Riodoce looked at three main stories .	-3.1642
There was the murder of the brother of the former famous boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.1653
They also had an exposé to government spending focused on the home city of the governor .	-2.9545
And there was a group that carried out a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the office of the prosecutor .	-2.7128
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so caution was required when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities .	-3.3684
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician who belongs to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century .	-3.2859
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption high-quality cases .	-3.1159
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this local , including a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-2.6092
Only a few months earlier , the readers would have seen the Valdez Column as the best informed source of kidnapping .	-3.1535
" In the past we would have known what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-3.5628
" Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . "	-2.3375
The Valdez office has become a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because the staff have become something they would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-3.5076
Reporter Miriam Ramirez snapped a few signs and went to a demonstration next morning because of another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-3.8197
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.8548
A burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-3.7901
In the whole country , journalists have become more vocal by writing down on pavements and buildings in organized protests " SOS Press " .	-3.6979
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to collect international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-3.4255
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they said the truth .	-2.7593
Since then , she has asked that it be redivided by the government , because she is concerned that her anger has injured her objectivity .	-3.2968
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-2.6269
In his last book " Narco-Journalism " he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also by politicians and security forces who were under one ceiling with organized crime .	-12.4630
The Articulo 19 media group assigned more than half of the attacks on police journalists last year .	-2.6677
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-2.0701
Obviously the killings have a deterrent effect .	-8.3895
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-1.8372
Your body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-3.2162
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separated head .	-2.1532
Some branches have chosen to close , such as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March . branch branb braa .	-10.1616
Others continue , as El Mananana of Nuevo Laredo did after the murder of their director in 2004 .	-1.9675
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with a leading article on the front page with the heading " What do you want from us ? "	-3.2478
Some journalists have fled from their own countries , or even from the country .	-2.2222
It is a painful decision .	-0.7895
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still watching the roads and looking for dangers .	-2.6086
And sometimes they are hunted , as seems to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-3.1689
For those who remain lagging behind and continuing the work , it is a daily dance with risky dechoic.	-4.1378
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-2.1320
" Mexico goes to hell , and so I became reporter , " he said .	-9.3461
At midnight on Friday , when the last issue was already finished , the editors of Riodoce sat at the city climb in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to sum .	-5.0360
A number of shooting shooters with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed dedeatdes .	-9.0110
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel messages in the region .	-2.1639
From the bordstone edge , they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phones .	-3.6770
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.5223
Sirens close by - another shooting in the area .	-2.8791
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who held guard to see if they were willing . a for . !!!!!!!!!!!	-12.5742
If they were afraid at all , they did not show it .	-1.9627
Under the enormous portrait of the founder of the newspaper , whose middle fingers were visible across Sinaloa , Riodoce staff followed his traces .	-3.8347
" How can you only think about it , " said Bojorquez , " if on the same day Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send it to the street for reporting . "	-4.7497
Dinosaurs used camouflage to avoid their enemies	-2.8541
At first glance it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.0127
Researchers have now found that the initial findings of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian miner worker were so good that experts described it as the " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.0328
It was so good that they even found that his scaly skin was of reddish brown - and they said she had something of a " troubled past " .	-4.0117
The report in the journal ' Current Biology ' described it as ' the best maintained dinosaur ever found , and one of the world 's best dinosaurs ' .	-3.3578
The fossil is a newly discovered kind of nodosaur , who lived in the middle of the circle between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.4470
Its incredibly well-preserved state has blundered researchers who describe it as ' really remarkable ' .	-3.3049
According to reports in National Geographic , the armoured plant resser is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.2934
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.8885
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock , and decided to look more closely .	-3.0726
The fossil discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontolog. fossil mfmfaround .	-13.2910
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pound ( 1,100 kg ) heavy earth clumps .	-2.7773
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.0490
" If you blink just a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell museum where the creature is seen .	-3.6496
" It will go into scientific history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs " .	-3.3772
Researchers have found that , although it is covered with an armor and resembles a changing tank , it was probably threatened by dinosaurs carrying meat .	-4.6651
The heavily armoured dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predatory animals and used a shielding technique known as counter-shadowing , which is also used by many modern animals .	-4.1361
This would have allowed mixing better in its surroundings and avoiding its enemies , say experts , which indicates that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-4.3804
The 110 million year-old creature from the family of Nodosauriers made headlines for the first time in May and is now available at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology . e !!! !! !.!!!!!!!!	-9.0368
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-3.3081
The astonishing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor over his body .	-2.9958
They discovered the countershade , a widespread defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of creature was darker than its base .	-3.3960
Although the backdrop is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds the animals living today .	-3.4546
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by sufficient pressure from meat feeding dinosaurs , that evolution favored confrontation as a means of survival .	-3.9655
But most contemporary animals using the background - think of row , zebras or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaur was subject to a real battle for survival .	-4.1166
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , highly ancestral dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of circle time must have been , " said Brown .	-4.5320
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of dinosaur was red brown .	-2.0345
Scientists continue to investigate the animal into evidence of his life , including his conserved intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-3.8572
They believe that when he died , the dinosaur was driven into a river and driven to the sea where he fell on the back to the sea .	-3.7864
At that time , Alberta was as warm as southern Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further landing than they are today .	-3.0553
" This nodosaur is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conserved scale , but also retains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-3.8782
" The result is that the animal looks almost as well as in the early circle period today .	-9.6651
You don 't need to use much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you look a little bit with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is on sleep . '	-9.3372
The circle time was a time when huge theropods , meat carnivorous dinosaurs , which were stood on two legs , drawn through the earth .	-5.2898
Although the king of them , who Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions years after Borealopelta , the dinosaur was driven by some of his fearful ancestors .	-12.5509
This includes Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tonnes of heavy monsters .	-2.8374
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal , believe that Borealopelta was sank and muddled after death in the sea .	-3.8585
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grubbed at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.8540
According to the museum , it is the best-preserved dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hip .	-3.2257
The creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-10.8915
It contained two twenty-twenty-long tips that were raising from its shoulders .	-4.6082
Researchers believe that Western Canada has flooded the armoured plant resser until an inflooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-5.5611
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.0566
The stoned remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the remains of the skin still cover holistic plants along the dinosaur	-4.3687
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lotto .	-2.3581
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.2966
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the hollow tank plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-4.1321
His right foot lies on his side , his five fingers are spread upwards .	-3.3484

In the Thunderstorm : Mass carambolage on A8 : Many injurpers	-9.4957
Heavy accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.2286
There are many injured , kilometre-long congestion and gaffers .	-2.9306
On the motorway Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured in a mass carambolage on the late Thursday afternoon .	-10.7615
According to initial information from the police , at 5 p.m. between Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg district ) during a thunderstorm , almost 30 vehicles , including probably lorries , were collapsed .	-5.2202
The exact number of injured people did not initially provide information .	-3.4415
They are light to serious injuries , a police spokesman said .	-2.9232
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the centre of the accident .	-2.9816
The A8 was fully blocked towards Munich .	-2.0571
A ten kilometre long backstau formed in Munich ’ s direction b.	-13.2168
As an AZ reporter reports , there were also massive disabilities on the opposite track - by numerous guffers .	-4.5808
The fire brigade listed the characteristics of the vehicle steerers , who now have sensitive penalties .	-4.4116
Shortly after 18 : 45 , a second accident occurred on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.4146
There was a collision between a car transporter and a car .	-2.5680
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident .	-2.9764
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests ' Comfort Check-in '	-1.4648
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced : nothing suspicious you sit in the train and sleep .	-4.0447
Or one is deepened in his work and has just a brilliant thought .	-3.1535
And then : bufff .	-1.1676
Comes the creator and raises an irgently or tears the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-4.1232
Ticket control .	-1.2179
But the days of interruptions are soon over .	-9.3427
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unique ticket control .	-2.5834
You simply confirm by mobile phone that you take your place and thus devalue the ticket .	-8.2443
At present a test operation runs on two routes .	-3.3370
" If the offer arrives , we extend it .	-2.5759
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway speaker .	-3.3355
" Comfort Check-in " calls the train ticket devaluation without creator .	-3.7168
However , in order to be able to use them , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-12.8650
And you have to book an online ticket - what most passengers already do .	-3.0532
You also have to buy the DB Navigator app , which is the most convenient way to book tickets .	-4.3212
Finally , you need a seat reservation .	-2.3243
Because " Comfort Check-in " works so : You get to the train , call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-4.4694
A button for electronic devaluation appears for test customers .	-3.1279
The train pets receive a notification on their mobile devices that passenger X is located in the train and taken the booked seat Y se.	-10.6444
He knows that a passenger with an already devalued online ticket is sitting there .	-4.3358
So you can go on sleeping , continue working , keep silent .	-3.1844
The " Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which , in turn , is intended to use the passengers .	-3.9117
" Whoever wants to travel through our train accompanying staff without relaxation checks in the DB Navigator itself .	-4.5231
This allows passengers to make their travel time more personal , " says Michael Peterson , the Marketing Board of DB Transport .	-3.4473
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-11.7177
Those who often travel know that besides delays and missed trains , ticket controls are among the greatest troubles .	-4.7020
You often have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-3.7446
Either the credit card or identity card , or otherwise a document that must be shown .	-4.3202
The result is endless discussions between train guides and passengers , leading to poor mood in the abbey or greater space and delays in controlling your ticket and , in the end , taking the creator the time to take care of other concerns .	-5.7127
Only a small number of test customers can make use of the new service .	-9.6909
And that only on the connections ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart food .	-2.6808
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet unlocked .	-2.2701
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-1.4968
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core .	-2.2337
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbn apartment that she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-6.1133
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-1.7036
" The police have just killed a 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " it said .	-2.9989
Confused , since nobody else had posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . ttwit.	-4.8438
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweett on her timeline .	-2.3212
The rapper from St. Louis was killed by an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by in Ferlive twe.	-20.4592
He posted a picture of brown ’ s lifeless body that stretched out on the streets and would remain there for four hours .	-11.0224
" That is wild " , Ferrell thought with himself .	-2.7451
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.5147
She put her mobile phone to return to tweets later in the evening about people on the Canfield-Drive .	-3.2613
There were photos of the police band and people who wrote , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who was a sign with the sign : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-3.7173
She observed a live feed where a policeman faced a group of demonstrators with a belligerent dog .	-3.1532
In another video , she said , decorated another policeman his rifle and scribed : " I will kill you ... animals all kill . "	-3.7941
" This is not common " , Ferrell remembered her statement .	-2.7292
'That is not the kind of murder we have accustomed to and which we can call typical ' .	-2.7972
At this moment I felt bulk frost .	-2.6070
I was angry and wept ' .	-2.1945
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.6294
After the landing at 9 p.m. , she picked up her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-3.7038
What happened in the following three years with Ferrell and Ferguson is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in cinemas from the 11th century .	-3.1749
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience that consists of the views of the people who live in the Community and have filled the roads to demand answers .	-4.0163
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , who had a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had countless times before this morning » about black experience and black condition <unk> .	-11.8170
" You remember how I taught you when black people must fight for what they believe ? " she remembered what she said .	-3.1928
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police have killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.0312
I could not take it with me , " said Ferrell later .	-2.0876
" What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past ...	-2.2220
It needs to know and see it and be raised .	-3.9527
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also the various strata of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-2.9542
Even though I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black women 's child .	-3.3164
I have the feeling that I would be doing her a bad service to keep them out of it . ' ' !!!!!!!!!!!!	-11.6203
The first station when she arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road , a place opposed to the police authority , which became a campsite when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.0659
There , Ferrell and her daughter connected themselves with a local business holder who made lunch .	-3.2093
They prepared pockets and helped pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.7880
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-1.5464
" My activism changed totally after 9 August " , she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association , focusing on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-3.7287
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.4644
It all came . '	-6.8037
Weeks later , Ferrell met one of the co-directors of the film during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan .	-2.3852
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar only wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.3121
One question came to mind : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can take advant??. '	-5.6208
This scepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often by whites , in a community that benefited from their pain and resistance .	-3.3115
As Folayan recently stated in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and grew up in Ferguson did not center their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-2.9038
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist in the field known for his activism around death stract occupants .	-3.4922
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years to Brown 's shooting .	-3.0443
" This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or speaks to us .	-2.5233
" That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented . "	-3.8419
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement ' is not a Messias-leader but a community that comes together , ' said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-3.5565
As a result , documents of " Whose Streets ? " surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life she falls in love and marries her wife .	-2.9295
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.8704
" But I understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanization of black people . "	-2.7680
In addition , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black live matter movement .	-2.5668
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , shaped the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-3.0067
" Black , gay women in management positions have worn the movement overall , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-3.5463
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . '	-8.4044
Folayan agreed to note that ' the movement is really kept up by black women and many black women ' .	-2.2226
However , it insists that ' this is not an affirmative type of action ' where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-3.2160
" She was the person who disrupted this energy , " she said .	-2.5448
" It is no coincidence , although she was on the front line , because in a life at these crossings as a black gay woman so much is at stake .	-3.8193
You can feel their energy through the screen . '	-2.0116
The news cameras in Ferguson have long disappeared , but the racial links between the community and the police continue to exist .	-3.1499
Ferrell is on trial for 2 <unk> years because of blocking a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.0149
She describes the social atmosphere of the area that she calls her home : " A chaos . "	-12.4545
However , she claims to be singing and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago in Ferguson .	-4.0135
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.9075
It is our duty to win .	-0.8171
We must love and support each other .	-0.9957
We have nothing to lose - except our chains ' .	-1.4840
From " Dream " to " Size Disease " : TV readers discuss bit gallery	-3.5725
The bit gallery moves people even though it is still a long way from being built .	-3.3175
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern side of the pedestrian zone has split the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.0436
Cold leaves the subject hardly any one .	-3.6152
The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.5930
While those who say to the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , come from the other side : " No man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Siggi Disease ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-4.8705
While advocates build upon a gallery drawing more customers into the city , benefiting the other shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed .	-5.1218
Additionally , the gallery is planned exactly on the plot on which the farmers ' market hall stands , where 13 direct markets offer their products .	-4.7337
This will stop at the beginning of the construction work .	-2.9406
The gallery machers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the beda place with possibility to seat outside .	-4.6961
Simone Room : " We have been buying almost weekly in the farm market hall for many years .	-3.1672
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of agricultural women over and over again .	-3.5742
We also discovered butchery for ourselves .	-1.8805
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer during and especially after building the gallery .	-3.5848
That is what exists in other cities .	-2.9503
The small market hall in Frankfurt is particularly interesting ' .	-2.4549
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct markets are located in a market hall in the gallery , the highest level of the rent comes .	-5.3246
However , I think that the new project will not be very low . '	-10.9302
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.6531
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets , I find this superfluous .	-2.6807
There is enough of this in our city .	-2.0182
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.0410
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we maintain at least the market hall .	-3.9152
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and is also cheap .	-4.1303
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are only rented by larger companies , because the rents there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-3.9278
It is a pity that special transactions are almost no longer available and what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-5.0409
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together .	-2.1202
And the gallery doesn 't fit into Bitburg .	-7.6943
Above all , where is the farm market hall to go during the construction period ?	-3.4280
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-3.3130
Or does the spectre bit gallery manage to distribute all businesses from Bitburg before ? '	-4.0437
George Marquet : " This simply will not work .	-1.6883
And nobody needs a shopping centre empty .	-2.4728
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farmer market instead of this gallery .	-2.7065
But , thanks to the insane number of - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg , there is no longer any place for a farming market hall . there there is noa ! ! !!! !! ! !! ! !	-11.6267
When the farmers ' market hall is broken , another piece of culture will disappear . '	-3.2030
A suitable similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-1.8208
In the middle of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-3.6316
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen potters and hair cuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.1715
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst sentenced a 35-year-old prison sentence after she made public diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.5850
The new exhibition , which was opened on 2 August , is called A Becoming Resemblance .	-2.7727
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united its specialist expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and manning , a transfer and groundbreaking dissident whose condemnation of Barack Obama was converted when he had only three days in his office .	-3.8300
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA , which was extracted by manning and created from the 30 portraits , what someone could look like with these genomic data , has sharpened a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual , commentary not only on the formability of DNA data - the many ways of interpreting and creating the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-4.9774
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was condemned for 20 charges in 2013 , including six infringements of the spy law , computer fraud and theft .	-3.6828
By prison , her image was oppressed , so much so that there was only one photo - a grain , black and white selfish where manning sits on a driver 's seat and wears a platinblonde - with which she was associated .	-5.3547
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 Stranger Visions project .	-2.1375
In it , the artist produced portraits of foreign artifacts from foreign artifacts such as cigarette and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to create an image of what these people might look like .	-4.4717
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.0380
" They led an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-2.8961
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so contact Chelsea and asked them whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-2.9918
The artist and her imprisoned muse became unequal letters who exchanged several letters over two years .	-3.5318
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which predicted a future in which President Chelsea ’ s judgment would convert and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-3.8347
Indeed , Obama ’ s demand for Manning ’ s release for seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.1608
There is now something deep and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against informers from the government camp and against transgender troops to find new , competitive ways to flame the rigid divisions that he should remedy .	-4.7972
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that ' things happen for a certain reason ' .	-2.4178
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for an end to the " automatic fragmentation based on gender , race , sexuality and culture " with its oversized signature .	-4.4842
On the opposite wall is its mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousand feeder of Cs and Gs and As written in pencil .	-3.0777
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show , by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) , how amazingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-3.2916
" What people hope to take with them is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data are for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also to be seen .	-3.8408
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so the 30 of these stories are . "	-2.4108
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned Comic Novelle .	-3.0929
It shows how it appears with a free speaking telephone from the United States disciplinary barracks like King Kong .	-3.6202
" When they cold your speech , they won , " says .	-3.1142
'So never hold the mouth ' .	-1.9616
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greeted from Philadelphia .	-2.0742
'I still get good skin when I talk about it ' .	-3.0330
Manning has not yet personally seen the exhibition - as foreseen in the comicbook - but if it does so , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by their own genomic simulacants , who , like Hordes of protesters , shared toher here .	-12.7784
This was also targeted , as everything in the exhibition , to the size ( 5 " 2 " , manning stature ) , where their genetic haplogroups were written with pencil .	-3.3456
" In the past I had it on the wall , but I wanted it to feel like a crowd of people , " said Dewey-Hagborg of the portraits .	-2.9781
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-3.1205
Professor of the University of Northwestern and an employee of the University of Oxford sought to kill	-2.9031
A nationwide hunting for human beings is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who were sought as suspects after a man had been broken up in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .	-4.9154
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the files of the Cook County Court .	-3.4595
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several rugs .	-11.7086
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.1986
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.3266
Cornell-Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of events , and detectives study the stitches as murder , while the police are actively looking for the two suspects , said officials .	-3.7957
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-1.7935
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice-President of University Relations , said in an email declaration that Lathem was now in a valid and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus .	-3.6580
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-2.9593
Warren is Senior Treasury Assistant at the University of Oxford .	-1.2800
A spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an email declaration that ' we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way ' .	-3.4424
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and wanted him to stand up to hi.	-3.0776

" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them reinforce themselves , " said Guglielmi .	-2.6705
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-1.7476
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who just received a puzzling tip that said that something happened in the apartment 1008 .	-3.7415
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9555
Guglielmi said that it was unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-1.9124
It was confirmed by safety cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.1660
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.5337
The Grand Plaza management team published an explanation to the inhabitants : " The police are currently working on the timeline and background of the victim and exploring a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-3.8597
'We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future ' - the Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko	-2.6426
Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) .	-2.9136
" At a particular stage in meeting the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-3.1310
The WADA road map was updated in this respect , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-2.6964
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA road map to comply with the code describing the criteria for reinstating RUSADA and recently published on the organization 's website .	-3.0376
According to Mutko , it does not contain anything that might give cause for concern to Russia .	-2.4207
" Everything has been announced , everything is implemented .	-7.0156
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.1769
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , notes that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the results of the investigation approved by the WADA by the Canadian lawyer , Richard McLaren , on alleged state-sponsored dopings in Russian sport .	-3.8376
Regarding the matter , Mutko said : " We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has admitted a mistake .	-3.3709
All measures have been implemented .	-1.2921
But there were no government programmes , and we will not admit anything that does not exist . ' '	-3.5017
Mutko ’ s words agreed with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-2.4566
In talking to the Russian sales point RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov gave past problems in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-3.4242
No one intends to accept this report unconditionally ' added Smirnov .	-2.2289
RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of doping controls in Russia in November 2015 in the course of the doping scandal from WADA .	-3.1544
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.0770
After a visit to the headquarters of the Organization in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA is moving ' in the right direction ' to be reinstated .	-3.2258
For the time being , Aldi is no longer selling an ee for .	-9.5869
The groups informed this .	-2.2751
It is a purely precautionary measure that no health impairment could be assumed in the communication .	-4.7921
From now on , only eggs are likely to be delivered to Aldi , which have proven to have been tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-noise .	-4.3911

The start-ups that will help your company not to become the next Uber	-9.0764
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your employees with your e-commerce start-up , but the polls did not work .	-3.0092
Answers were often vague , little helpful or , worse still , fraudulent .	-2.5314
Even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-2.1003
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care company Madison Reed .	-2.7263
She has called for help from outside .	-1.6582
A new race of Human Resources Start-ups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-2.8051
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it enables companies to carry out surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , provide anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases allow whistleblowers to circumvent the C-Suite executives and directly contact the administratmbure.	-15.6598
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for pursuing their health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees ’ commitment .	-3.2816
Save said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel won with Glint in the three years .	-9.5615
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card of the company that shows at a glance which units have most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so you can drill why .	-4.1390
Companies come to recognize that at the top of the workplace culture , so that you do not become the next uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment where those who have spoken have been punished .	-10.7882
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.2028
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial site Let 's Talk Payments .	-2.3728
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , who helps prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber case in discredit .	-3.3233
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.3832
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.9947
As Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailor-made " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-3.2403
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.4879
And if the main director is involved , complaints will go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.9734
" The court of public opinion has covered the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and managing director of Convercent .	-2.5257
If a company is found that treats its employees poorly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , worker fluctuation and complaints , Quinlan said .	-3.7854
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , has used Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy opportunity to reach their headquarters .	-3.6302
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.3054
It was often an intimidation and inconvenient experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-2.9058
Now that the company is using Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair internships - can be identified and addressed more quickly .	-4.0274
" I can get closer to this holistic , 360-degree view of employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the Risk Management Group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.1246
'And we protect our shareholders from employment disputes ' .	-2.4734
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee commitment more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed for ethical infringements by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-3.2884
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty laundry went online .	-3.2322
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.6617
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service , and burden companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .	-3.1302
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups .	-3.4307
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , increasing the total capital to $ 47 million .	-2.9237
Glittering secured $ 10 million in November of Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all its funding to $ 60 million .	-2.9669
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.2502
There is a growing complex of research that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done .	-12.3857
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only bets .	-2.4793
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-2.8095
" When people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worth it , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.5384
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are committed and committo working .	-5.0191
If the Analytics Tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and use of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.4633
Data on employee engagement according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .	-3.1838
But the data is useless when a company ’ s managers do not take action .	-3.0088
Indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may be expected to change the way .	-3.4730
And if change does not come fast enough , or not at all , this can breed disappointments and demotivate employees .	-3.0665
" If you ask about 4,000 suggestions , you must be ready to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Kotter International business management company , who has seen companies that have rely too much on the collection of data .	-3.8219
" For if you will not follow will ask employees , " Have ye really heard me ?	-3.0962
Do you take care of this ?	-1.6914
And who you are not concerned about why should I ? '	-2.8124
Madison Reed , who is now carrying out monthly surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , said Save .	-3.3264
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was capable of reorganizing several teams within the company and adding communication training to tackle the problems .	-3.5493
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into its employees and , in the long term , it hopes that this will lead to a better connection between workers in an industry that is known for high sales .	-5.2168
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-1.7079
" And if you lose people , you lose customers too .	-1.9559
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-1.7812
NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for Bruins	-2.9606
A lot of UCLA football players on one side of the new training fields of the team talk on the campus .	-4.2611
Some have pulled out their tricot parts and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-2.9562
For a good part of the team , these inactive minutes are a lunch break .	-2.6761
Players enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final tests after the three-hour practice before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning .	-4.0937
" This is a real tretmill for the guys the next three days , " said Bruins trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.3433
NCAA eliminates two day exercises to facilitate the burden of players , and has actually extended their days , at least until the Friday final .	-15.2712
Therefore , the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19 : 15 to meet the already full timetables of players .	-4.1737
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras six gaming times in Westwood practical exercises .	-3.8940
They are to hold 18 exercises during August , 20 before the beginning of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-4.0848
Mora said that he supported the regulatory change of the NCAA even if he adds another point to the many employed routes of the players .	-4.4299
" We place this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-10.6373
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to fill , they are great people .	-3.0075
I think that as soon as we come until Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . ' !! !! !	-9.3941
The UCLA will end its practices once the camp is completed , which will not be an easy task , given the clear views of its fields from an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskin Center , a hotel of the upper class that has already been designed with footballs that cleared up a protection network behind a gate post .	-6.3042
Bruins players are to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season . arrival at the bar bar bar fffb f.	-11.2157
'We will use our security ' , said Mora .	-1.9657
" This is a real problem , and it is not far reflected that people rent a room there and then adjust to recording an exercise .	-4.2568
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a very good store .	-3.1627
But we have security forces there and we have security forces in parking 8 .	-2.2524
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.3211
I am not therefore very concerned about this .	-2.6527
We have a plan ' .	-1.0719
Facebook wants to intensify facts review in the fight against counterfeit news	-2.8156
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third party facts checkers whose results are displayed under the original contribution , said the world 's largest online social network on Thursday , one of his efforts to fight so-called fake news .	-11.8906
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will begin using updated machine learning methods to recognize possible false messages and send them to facts checkers who may display results of the facts checking from the original article .	-4.2881
Facebook was criticized as one of the main points of distribution for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential elections in 2016 .	-15.0603
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French electorate flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to eliminate hateful postings quickly , as before the elections there in September .	-4.4333
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the USA , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.0870
" In addition to knowing which stories are being contested by third-party fact reviewers , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-13.3808
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature on the " associated article " and will work on other changes to his news feed to reduce false news .	-13.4141
Creating a Comic Roman : A Castle in the History of E. . !	-12.1503
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.0504
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophairy Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-3.6139
" I find it so nice to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says humbly .	-2.5703
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand ' .	-1.3758
" A Castle in England " spans time from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families living in Scotney .	-3.6347
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he unexpectedly found emotional .	-2.9067
" I only responded to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s who worked for the Jacobinians , " he says .	-3.7895
'That is its thumb print !	-7.4681
And letters always smell of smoke , because then a fire was ignited because of light .	-3.5583
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if he were himself with it .	-3.3807
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.3765
For someone who is so beaten with old documents that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest : I have a little overvalued my welcome greet " ) this seems all too nice to be true .	-4.5871
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted hyane heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in ditches .	-13.1179
He migrated through the terrain and ruins of the old castle and spoke to landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes also to the artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-3.7031
Then , night he dronk " Whiskey and started writing " .	-2.2614
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown because the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-2.5466
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees started looking after the archive that he described as " hundreds of years in which Aristocrats said " Oh , thrown it on the attic " .	-11.7262
Diary , letters from the time of the English Empire , maps that represent who owned what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fought the two families .	-3.6946
Guys , let everything go ! "	-1.8566
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point for immersing in English history on a broader basis , including The Labourer , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the 1381 farmer uprising .	-12.9552
" There is a record of a turmoil that appeared in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says RhodeRhoR. . !!!!!!!!!!!!	-11.8708
" The farmer uprising began in this area and I thought a rebellion was a good beginning .	-2.8988
Perhaps the two are linked ? '	-1.6941
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle , such as ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuit patriot , whom the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English reformation . there are builbuilbuilbubuilbububububuildinbuilbuilbuilbuilbuil	-13.6566
Or ' The Smuggler ' , in which the smuggler Arthur Darrell was represented from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was only made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-3.9952
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favorite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be quite pauners , keep debting and spending money on things they could not afford .	-4.5601
Other generations of Darrell men solved their debt crises by marrying rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to advertise inheritants ' .	-3.0213
After the end of his work in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences	-2.8786
He brought behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel over Elämänki , the site of a sanatorium from the early 20th century , which has since been recalled by nature .	-4.4619
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.4446
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.3064
It was like : ' Oh , now I must return to the damn life ' .	-2.9568
Campaign launched : Over 300 years old chapel of Marienkapelle in Rhöndorbuvar.	-6.3718
With the prevention of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign for the introduction of a new roof brand ( Thursday Rundschau ) .	-4.0873
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret until Thursday .	-2.9900
At the end of August there will be a celebration of the campaign on the island of Grafenwerth .	-2.8465
" Too nice for us .	-1.7797
Or ? " , the makers of the action since yesterday ask the posters at the Rhöndorf Chapel .	-3.3574
" We do not really think this ( of course ! ) , they write on their website yesterday .	-3.8094
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.4830
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-1.9113
Basically , we firmly believe that , as Bad Honnefer citizens , we know very well about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-9.3609
The action is about more than " just " a logo and a slogan , it continues to say .	-2.9952
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive feature " .	-3.3955
Finally , it is competing with other local authorities .	-2.6550
The city of Bad Honnef has a medium five-digit amount to cost its new rooftop brand and campaign .	-4.1696
Military reforms in Turkey - Erdogan 's Fear of the Army	-1.5731
Every year at the beginning of August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on retirement and transportation in the officer ’ s corps .	-3.3224
This week , too .	-2.0532
At first glance a normal process .	-1.4691
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces a year after the coup attempt .	-2.4225
The meeting was no longer held in the building of the General Staff , as before , but in the office of the Prime Minister .	-4.0400
The consultations , chaired by the Head of Government , also participated in the five Vice-Prime Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .	-3.7528
Thus , civilians in the YAS were over-numbered .	-3.4866
The government attracts reins in the military .	-1.7291
Although Hulusi Akar is in office , the commanders of the army , the air forces and the navy have been dismissed .	-4.2725
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-1.8383
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army 's ranks , mostly due to alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who Erdogan sees as the wire holder of the coup trial .	-4.9882
Ankara has been negotiating against 486 people directly involved in the coup attempt .	-3.2473
Even in the day after the coup , Erdogan had referred to the " God gift " as he gives him the opportunity to " completely clean the armed forces " .	-4.2441
But does Erdogan really control the army ?	-1.6223
In late February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article with the heading " Unease in the military headquarters " .	-2.8409
In the General Staff there are concerns about the increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which , among other things , manifested itself in the lifting of the ban on headscarf for soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-3.8865
At any rate , large-scale making in the army and the security forces continues .	-3.9756
In mid-July , Erdogan fired another 7395 public servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.2637
Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military .	-2.2149
The generals were previously considered the country 's masters .	-13.6914
Three times , they appealed to their role as guardians of the secular order .	-2.4593
After his 2002 election victory , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least appealing to the European Union ’ s reform targets .	-4.1171
Former officers say that Erdogan is targeted at Islamising the armed forces .	-2.8793
The magazine " Vocal Europe " warned a named officer who , for fear of persecution abroad , sought asylum that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years .	-4.0992
If that is true , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.5902
In any case , the alliance following cleansing doubts about the Turkish army 's willingness to operate .	-3.3523
The leadership structures and operational skills are " weakened " , say NATO diplomats .	-2.0351
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules	-1.5160
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , said President Donald Trump , cited by the media .	-1.8706
It provides for legal immigrants to reduce to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-3.2163
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.3619
The draft law is to be discussed in the two chambers of the Congress .	-2.5047
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way in which citizens from other countries are spent Green Cards ' .	-3.1397
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.2360
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial resources to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " Trump said , quoted by the American media .	-3.0755
Ministry wants to renew route for race shuttle	-3.5514
Over the past few months , the future of the race shuttle has been disputed - now it is going to be quite fast .	-14.8533
Even before the end of the year , it will be built on the marod route on which the tourist railway is running .	-5.5411
In order to ensure the future of the race shuttle in the long term , the Ministry of Transport indicates that construction work is to begin this year .	-4.5152
" With the decision to continue ordering and renovating the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig , the country commits itself to this important connection , especially for tourism , " declared transport secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-4.6496
The cost of repairing the route was about EUR 2.5 million .	-2.5601

The Ministry and the South Thuringian railway operators are already in agreement on the technical details .	-2.9369
" With this , the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Sühl .	-3.0131
The planned contract between the Ministry and the railway company will be concluded for 11 years .	-2.7161
This will regularly order the race climbing shuttle on December 2017 .	-3.3846
The Rennsteig-Shuttle is a popular railway link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially among tourists .	-2.9950
In recent months , pilot operations have been tested whether the route is used by sufficient numbers to regularly order it in the future .	-4.6691
The track is also strongly constructive in parts .	-3.8543
The rise of sex robots is real and we should be concerned about it . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-10.1337
Especially when you thought that it could not become even more mad in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes .	-9.1515
Yes , indeed .	-0.9503
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-1.2942
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( Foundation for Responsible Robotics ) ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .	-1.9274
According to Noel Sharkey , an emerged professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-2.6486
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast wart and the type of fingernail .	-2.4146
" People make themselves fun about them , but companies supply a lot of them , and we will see them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-14.0728
Modern sex dolls have developed from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm , with deliberately human responses achieved by artificial intelligence .	-2.9736
The user can also customize his robots according to his convictions , selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the form of breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-11.5528
But it becomes even more disturbing because many robots have the " personalities " that a Stepford woman would look progressive .	-3.2361
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.8894
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the properties they find appealing , such as shy .	-14.8378
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of shy and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-3.4251
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality " , swarms the website of True Companion .	-2.9023
So may they what you like , and they don 't like what you don 't like , etc .	-2.3515
She also has her moods over the day - how real people !	-2.4366
She can be tired , fixed on conversation or she can be " in mood " !	-10.6930
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the submissive female characteristics , the allegations of rape when one step at Frigid ( here : reluctant ) Farrah , worry one most .	-5.1907
On his website True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-1.9627
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men then have no roxxy ? " says on the site .	-3.3795
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.2454
Their origins and their increasing refinement point to something darker and deeper in our culture , to a withdrawal from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-3.7641
Most men , of course , will not keep sex robots , and while the FRR notes their rising popularity , they will still remain on the margins of consumer culture .	-4.3970
But what lessens from the peripheral areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.5266
And many people are not strange or offensive until they have the free market permission to do so .	-2.5386
There is a certain overlapping that these advanced sex robots emerge at a time when the rights of women are threatened worldwide , in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted sexually attacking women .	-3.9315
The most deterrent aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphical images , the swallowed bodies and the eyes broken , but how realistically this vision works .	-4.2898
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .	-2.9448
The aim behind these sex robots is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( albeit with pornostar proportions ) .	-2.4755
Their farmers want them to feel humane that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-9.2507
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , robots are not real women .	-2.8840
They cannot separate themselves from their pet or just go away .	-2.6618
They have no mediation or background story , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-3.0515
In other words , they are complacent slaves .	-1.9190
Or to put it in the 2017 speech : service girls	-1.8142
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.2841
He Mitt Romney Makes Common Senses	-12.7342
It has become a Trump era ’ s binding wisdom that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-2.9332
Around Christmas and Harvest , there have been newspapers in the US with advice on how to handle Trump ’ s horror of relatives .	-3.4098
We are all supposedly struggling to burst our filter bubbles .	-2.7982
Less noticed is Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-1.8798
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been dealing with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-2.9675
She reminded me that unity can have a powerful effect against a common enemy .	-1.7740
With Trump in the White House , everyone who knows it , including the Republican family with whom it had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly on the same side .	-13.4320
As far as the dining table is certainly a good thing , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails significant risks .	-4.3463
The left was strengthened by Trump , but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to put us all right .	-2.4840
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his powers will no longer reject us .	-4.0402
However , there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans ' normalize ' the right wing , who suddenly appear to be the embodiment of sensibility compared to his standards .	-4.8271
Today , I find myself involved in an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urkomic version of the Crazy – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like ) – both of which are in fact a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-5.7005
When Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be mentally healthy only to qualify as immeasurable improvement .	-3.0545
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Central Park Carousel , the largest carousel of the New York Park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you do not need a caffeine .	-3.9951
The horses are enormously large , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crispy and the animals are twisting to look fearfully at their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climping music reveals this in a strange way .	-5.1339
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines become familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .	-3.3306
Thirty and thirty years later , and I am still not entirely overlooking the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the theme pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a great circle in northern London .	-4.2545
However , the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience , because two two years old , a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time .	-4.9618
If I could have assessed the Carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.4321
On the other hand , this week I was forced to assess my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could draw my credit card .	-3.1038
In the coffee house at the corner of my street , it is the same , plus the option of making the evaluation with a 15 % drinking money - to buy something above the shop table .	-5.1589
This not only slows down what should actually be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to introduce personality into a situation where no need is .	-13.8662
The poor woman in the department store was excusingly grinding , while I tired of experiencing my credit card with five stars .	-4.2780
Oscar Pistorius moved to hospital with breast pain from prison	-2.9513
For the second time , Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital visit .	-2.7348
Last year he was brought to the hospital because of the treatment of cuts to his hand joints , which he said to the prison authorities after a case in his cell .	-4.1564
Pistorius was sentenced against the first death sentence for murder after an appeal by the prosecutors .	-3.5616
He killed Steenkamp in the early hours of the Valentine Day 2013 , taking them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.9973
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night intruder who hided himself in the cabin .	-2.8210
Public prosecutors have announced their intention , this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , of which they say that it is too lenient .	-6.3358
The National Prosecution Agency said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .	-3.0570
Pistorius runs the risk that his penalty will be increased to 15 years when the prosecutors are successful .	-12.2440
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8455
As Farmer Arnold Finds a Curious Egg	-2.5327
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the quarters from Fützen and Epfenhofen were released in the holidays and in the secondary schools .	-4.2777
Three of the redundant students will go to the school in future , four to the real school .	-12.8581
Schuller Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Biesental in Epfenhofen on Tuesday evening .	-2.4778
As a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and director Meder , chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm , but who was then dismissed in freedom .	-4.9158
The munter Schar held a musical entitled " The eagle in the chicken courtyard " .	-5.0968
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and caused it to erupt from his chickens .	-2.9363
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle emerged .	-2.1396
But the hope of making him a chicken dismantled , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared .	-4.3558
Then the classes showed three and four in the study of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-2.5894
The hens danced with the young gockels who wear cylinders to the bet .	-2.8463
The eagle stands for integration , said School Head of Angelika Sitte .	-9.4375
The young pet is different from the other young animals ( chicks ) , but is one of them .	-4.0998
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.2314
His provision be free .	-1.9771
She wanted every quarter-class to feel at home in his new school .	-2.7441
Thank you to my fellow Members , the former school leader Michael Müller , who continues to step into teaching shortages and the parents .	-5.3410
The chicken season is over , said Sophia Schumacher class teacher .	-3.6010
She released her students after two years of teaching very reluctant , because it was a really great time .	-4.9147
Finally , they have been able to rely on fourth classes .	-3.0536
In conclusion , all students made a song of summer time and holiday period sound .	-4.3856
The children were very pleased with this .	-3.4437
Eight first classes are already registered for the new school year .	-2.3617
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.2455
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal campsites in Greece , shared the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-2.7221
On the morning of 1 August , the police arrested a group of illegally tended people , including the two Bulgarians .	-2.5445
They were released on the same day , while an investigation is currently under way .	-2.4089
The Foreign Ministry reported that the Bulgarians were later released .	-1.7062
The Greek authorities have tightened up control of the free camp and have put considerable fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.3094
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-1.9188
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .	-2.0334
Software update for diesel vehicles : What the people concerned need to know now	-11.4642
How exactly is the software update taking place ?	-7.3141
Does diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?	-2.6560
The most important questions and answers in the overview .	-2.1309
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .	-2.5021
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars of the Euro 5 emission classes and in part Euro 6 .	-3.6737
Euro 4 diesel or worse are exempt .	-2.0334
Anja Smetanin from the ACE Auto Club of Europe gives assessments :	-2.1294
Is the new action mandatory ?	-0.9421
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.0327
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles with foam software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-2.7968
The Federal Carrier Office ( CBA ) ordered its retrofitting equipment .	-14.5103
How and from when will customers be informed about updates ?	-1.6367
Manufacturers have announced rapid implementation over the next few months , but have not yet mentioned a precise date .	-3.3650
Daimler has informed you to write to every person concerned .	-3.5247
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its framework .	-2.8981
How much longer will the overall changes take ?	-2.9747
'Hard to say ' means Smetanin .	-2.3979
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and political pressure .	-2.4512
" For we have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the subject of the environment so . "	-3.5306
How long should the update take ?	-1.4013
The rearmament itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.8129
Time-consuming could be getting a deadline .	-9.2468
What drivers do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.7714
The ACE is waiting .	-1.9740
Presumably , foreign manufacturers would follow , says Smetanin .	-2.7230
Now is the threat of a massive price decline in Euro 4 cars ?	-3.1938
The ACE fears this .	-1.3100
But precisely in the regions where driving bans threaten .	-2.5404
In rural areas there have been no loss of value for older diesel so far .	-9.7909
The ACE advises to wait with a sale .	-2.1039
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center Award	-1.5884
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in the Washington .	-1.5784
President Trump ’ s first award promises to become political .	-1.6022
One of the winners does not want to come - from protest .	-2.2211
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the coveted awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-2.7369
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and Choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the talents .	-3.4534
The awards will be passed at the beginning of December .	-9.6193
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and take part in the award together with his wife Melania .	-2.5134
The Lear award winner , who has been announced with progressive TV series , has therefore already announced that he would not participate in the Gala .	-4.8117
The ' New York Times ' he said : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even withdraw the resources - and that is a burden to me ' .	-4.3357
The 59-year-old Estefan stressed that she will use the talk with Trump to clarify her view .	-3.0936
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.4190
Former prize winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-2.0196
We Make the City Valuable	-2.2099
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city master , will retire next year .	-3.0077
The job is already advertised - suitable candidates are rare .	-3.3900
For 31 years Wacker has been the master city tree .	-3.7835
And the work still gives him great fun as he conveys in the press conversation .	-3.9069
He reports varied , but also demanding tasks that are waiting for his successors .	-3.2536
At the same time , it is surprising that so far no application meets the requirement profile .	-3.1356
The city is looking for an architect or construction engineer at the next possible time .	-3.0111
Thus , with regard to the regular termination periods , enough time for incorporation is still to be enough .	-5.3359
Since Haslach serves as a lower construction rights authority for the administrative community , the candidate must have accounts .	-4.4076
This function definitely wants to keep the city .	-2.8878
If they were no longer able to fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-3.1481
But closeness to the city and its own importance says Wacker , who reports of a good operating climate and good mood between the authority and the citizens .	-4.1992
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have accumulated , on which wackers are proud .	-3.7038
" We make the city worth living " , he is safe about the building office and his staff .	-3.4819
In the future , however , varied projects will continue to be on the agenda : for example , the transformation of the former Hukla area and the low-courtyard parking lot have started .	-5.3937
The Kinzig bridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .	-2.9839
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million , ' if we do it right ' , appreciates Wacker .	-3.8001
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-2.3455
The work here is fun . '	-1.3128
Gestalteristic is available for a master of city tree .	-10.9201
With Haslach ’ s own construction and gardening , many things can be reacted quite flexibly .	-3.5730
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green facilities is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-3.6735
Since the old town is an ensemble under monument protection , it is important to ' have an eye for what fits in ' when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city master stresses .	-4.9449
In any case , the town master bears high responsibility .	-3.9374
He is a builder , " in the end everything runs here about my table " .	-3.6710
With care and coordination , he can count on long-standing employees : Markus Neumaier ( high-construction ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( deep building ) has been in the process for 15 years .	-5.0836
Also , that his successor remains long , Wacker wants : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and remain identified with the place " .	-4.1488
Continuity is important not only for a good operating climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-2.9468
After information from the city of Haslach , those who wish to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to provide a completed study as a diploma engineer or bachelor with specialist architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction planning law .	-5.8994
The town construction office is subject to high and low construction , construction planning , basic advertising matters , management of urban properties , urban operating courtyard with Bauhof and Stadtgartnerei as well as lower construction rights authority including monument protection .	-6.4359
Bicycles thrown to lines : Closed southern railway line	-3.7040
According to the police , the unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the Leobener Strasse ( B116 ) to the lines .	-4.1420
These were damaged so much that the appropriate train had to be stopped .	-3.0067
The investigators go out of two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-2.9264
A pink scooter and bicycle driver were observed close to the cathedral .	-4.5358
" This goes far beyond a couple of papers , " said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch zur APA .	-4.0493
The perpetrators or perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and would have jeopardized train transp.	-4.2867
In addition to the damage to the lock and the plant , as well as the delay minutes and the cost of rail replacement transport could also be paid to the perpetrators by rail customers .	-5.9050
All in all , it was said that the speaker said it was a " substantial " sum .	-5.3761
The damage was resolved on Friday afternoon and rail transport on the southern railway could be carried out without disabilities .	-11.7993
Almost ten people were trains on Friday morning , two of them were long distance transport .	-3.8631
Freight trains were not made , but they were late .	-2.9423
According to <unk>BB speakers Christoph Posch , about 200 metres of pipelines had to be exchanged .	-10.6475
Isolators and masts have also been damaged .	-1.5674
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease )	-2.0808
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.1699
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseases .	-2.6666
The incurable state of around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the UK causes stomach and leaves , recurring or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-3.6478
While the people affected are usually being advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid Tryptophan contributes to developing immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal .	-4.3910
The senior researcher , Dr Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol intestinally to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in eating do not enter the body .	-3.3481
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues . for exampepe.	-16.5783
If the balance tends too far toward inflammation , it can result in an inflammatory disease .	-2.6543
Experiments found that a kind of tolerance immune cell occurs in mice that carry a certain bacterium in its introduction .	-4.5271
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-2.3414
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a connection between a bacterial type - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-2.7611
The more tryptophan the mice had in their food , the more they had of these immune cells . . . !!!!!!!!!!!!!	-11.0375
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a rich diet of tryptophan promote more tolerant , less inflammatory darmily if the same system also applies to humans .	-3.3627
The postdoctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes Barragan investigated a kind of immune cell that promoted tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not .	-3.9297
She suggested that the difference between the intestinal microbioms of the mice was to do - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-3.8342
The insulation of the mice were sequenced by DNA and six bacteria were found which were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them lacking in the mice .	-11.8973
Mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked a darmic biom and they did not develop this type of immune cell , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-3.6245
To understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-3.6467
Immune cells evolved into tolerancing cells .	-2.3607
When the active component was cleaned from liquid , it proved to be a by-product of the tryptophan metabolism known as indol-3 milk acid .	-2.9617
When researchers doubled the quantity of tryptophan in the feed of the mice , the number of such cells rose by about 50 % , but when the tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.3710
Dr. Cervantes Barragan explained that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice , and that most of us L. reuteri protect in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.5748
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-3.4511
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , because these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestinal .	-2.8625
Potentially , high tryptop values in the present of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population . '	-3.2360
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United with Nemanja Matic has committed a " genius "	-2.4821
At Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho believes after the midfield player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.4482
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup begins against Real Madrid on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder role , when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira prevailed as they like .	-4.3505
However , Matic was excluded from the preparatory Asian tour of the blues and created only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-3.6501
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-2.0758
'We will help him sooner than later . '	-1.8365
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the Aviva stadium , when Mourinho formed his start-XI for the beginning of the season .	-10.3461
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three new commitments , but insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority renewables .	-3.9553
" Three of four to get , for which I thank the club , " he added .	-2.2900
'I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made a great effort ' .	-3.2906
Boeing Malt " Dreamliners in the Sky	-1.8726
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted the silhouette of a dreamliner into the sky .	-2.5344
The pilots flew from Seattle to the US State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in Michigan , and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , several thousand kilometres .	-4.3454
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.6620
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner .	-2.4694
This was a stamina test for new engines .	-2.3181
Boeing had already made such advertising .	-1.9152
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing-Logo was painted in the sky . .	-10.0574
New Beat for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a Problem	-2.4553
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still the SPD leader , social-democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before el.	-11.7577
But no disturbances from the party centre , merely no headwinds from the covenant - that was the most important desire of the election campaigners .	-9.5979
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-1.8677
Since then , Willy Brandt employees have been watching events in SPD-ruled country capitals with growing horror .	-3.8600
What Schulz received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described in the approach with headwinds .	-3.0611
They were deep strikes .	-2.4074
One by one .	-2.3035
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sends a general signal against coalitions of SPD and Green .	-2.9975
" That shows once again : Rot-Grün simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-8.3529
The surprising group debate by a Green Member has plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.3244
Five months before the rural election , its red green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-2.8965
Green Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the breakaway Niedersaxon Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate .	-3.7622
Transferring to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will of the electorate .	-2.7614
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and campaign manager of the Greens to the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-2.9228
" After all , everything must not be true , " a SPD electoral campaign sights when the new message of hiobs reaches the party centre on Friday morning .	-5.0769
Stephan Weil , Prime Minister of Lower Saxony SPD , stands for the CDU without a majority of governments following the transfer of green MEPs , Elke Twesten .	-4.6738
It is the preliminary culmination of a whole range of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-11.7569
And nobody knows what comes next .	-1.5077
The misery began with the unexpected defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-2.2567
A blue eye , no longer , the colleagues calmed .	-10.9781
After the rural elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-1.9898
That also became - and it all became much worse .	-3.5677
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the thaumel , the Düsseldorf defeat smoothed the party .	-3.8679
In the weeks afterwards , the colleagues rapped up again .	-5.0160
Then , when they had just created new courage , the G-20 summit in Hamburg came .	-3.0500
And with him came the next floor .	-2.3881
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD chief , lost his nimbus at that weekend because he sat in Elbphilharmonie while burning his city .	-3.5425

Due to the VW exhaust affair and its role in the Supervisory Board , the Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been critical for a long time .	-3.6896

Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for this reason , Because in recent weeks tried to put more and more emphasis on the covenant .	-5.3777
The ambition of the former mayor of Hanover to expand his power in Berlin remained unhidden in the area of Martin Schulz .	-3.7465
They allowed him because they promised to stabilize the party .	-2.9664
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-4.7992
Because the party ’ s internal dispute between the Lower Saxony Greens basically does not blame .	-4.5847
And Schulz is not .	-9.3542
For the time being , therefore , the comrades seek to keep their own ranks closed .	-4.1071
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and especially at the breakaway parliamentarian Twesten .	-2.9100
" It is intolerable and democratic damaging , as Mrs Twesten puts her own career interests over the interests of all the others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.7722
Mrs Twesten has been elected to Parliament , not because of her person as a direct candidate , but through the List of the Netherlands of the Greens of the Netherlands , so the Lower Saxon Member goes on .	-11.2836
The logical consequence would be for them to return their mandate .	-1.8890
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Group , complains of an ' undemocratic manoeuvre ' .	-2.6315

Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives STEG Stadtentwicklung am Wednesday in Empfingen .	-3.5688
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again looked back at what happened to date .	-3.0765
Since 1991 there have been reconstruction areas in Empfingen .	-2.6646
Back then , in the refurbishment area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Württemberg took over two-thirds of the sum of funding .	-3.9964
In the 2005-2016 refurbishment area , the subsidy was 60 % .	-4.5345
For schindlers , the previous reconstructions are a " success project " - it is important , after all , to promote interior development , and not just to open up new areas of construction .	-5.6434
On 4 April , the Bureau of Government received information that there will be a refurbishment area III .	-3.0790
The sum of funding is EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the municipality received .	-3.7426
How does a refurbishment area arise ?	-2.7776
You will continue to examine where the " truly old " houses are .	-3.2287
However , it also has a role to play whether there is any interest in the planned area at all .	-3.9878
If necessary , the territorial borders could also change again .	-3.3007
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.9791
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Country Programme " Social City " , in which the refurbishments would then be carried out .	-4.1593
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of inner cities , the improvement of housing and employment relationships and the preservation and development of infrastructurestructure .	-5.0197
The measures would be implemented object-related , that is to say per plot .	-14.7681
The refurbishment area would then be defined as a statute .	-3.2745
Since 1 January 2017 , the approval period for funding has been until 30 April 2026 .	-3.9163
However , until September of this year , the inventory would only be carried out in order to give a questionnaire to those involved in the refurbishment area .	-5.1568
In November or December , the Statutes ' decision should be as possible to start rehabilitation next year .	-4.7084
Pietzschmann subsequently declared that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned investigations .	-3.9855
It is a question of evaluating urban abuses and deciding when to renovate and to what extent .	-3.8103
A refurbishment note will be registered in the property for the respective property .	-5.1262
Pietzschmann will come back to reception himself and get a picture of the situation , promised them .	-8.1932
He emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .	-3.4971
Therefore , there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and will be able to be filled out until the end of the summer holidays .	-4.2462
The yellow questionnaire is the " arch of buildings and land " , which includes , among other things , the construction state and the refurbishment intentions .	-4.4949
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing bow " , information on size , division and residents of a living room can be made .	-4.4106
The blue " operating arc " must be filled only when operating in the building commercial areas .	-4.5659
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not a request for funding at the same time .	-3.5129
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible for support . building measengine.	-12.3366
Schindler emphasised that the distribution of funds works according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first , pays first .	-4.0237
You cannot ' book funds for later ' .	-2.8825
Finally , photos of the project " Centre II " were shown to make the present a " tasty " refurbishment .	-4.3375
British inventors set themselves a microchip to come with a hand movement in houses and cars	-3.2654
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open its doorstep , enter its office and even start its car with a hand movement .	-13.0907
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointing fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by their company BioTeq .	-3.5393
He has joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory Anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.0393
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.2240
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles at houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , everything for an extra fee of <unk> 300 per castle .	-10.3369

The White House ’ s Advertising Cost Thousands of Taxpayers . thousth.	-9.5244
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the south lawn for an event highlighting American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to USD 24,000 according to the military ’ s information left to the TIME magazine .	-3.2759
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-2.9611
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence , and White House senior officials made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-2.2153
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was issued next to a yacht made of Maine , a fire car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-3.7359
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , hardly 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.5775
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-3.3277
The message indicated that the helicopter arrived on July 17th against 7am at South Lawn for the event at 3 p.m. and so long until the grass was cleaned this evening between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 .	-4.6426
The note adds that , if the departure from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would be needed for return flights because of the limitation of service hours .	-4.0589
The original crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained at the aircraft during the ftime . mflflbbflyflights . ffmful fbflighfare . !!f	-25.2629
The records made available by the TIME were not clear whether a second crew was ultimately needed .	-3.2544
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes .	-10.4031
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could infringe the provision .	-2.4481
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-2.6272
" Sounds as if you are locked " , the deputy commander responded .	-2.7419
The event " Made in America " was described as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.2643
But official events also have political upper tones .	-1.6272
At the event , the President provided an impetus for the reform of the health reform underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to combat government regulations .	-4.6003
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.4084
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-1.9399
But requesting their use only for a photo op is unusual .	-2.7617
Trump carried out an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .	-11.3948
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers with American materials , " said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walter .	-10.8837
HMX-1 crews often carry training flights around Washington and South Lawn to remove US presidents in the White House with precise centimeter rates .	-3.6372
When Trump was in Germany at the G20 summit in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 training landings in the White House .	-2.7968
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of the crew for the month , a civil servant said .	-3.5401
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for ' non-presidential support missions ' .	-2.5871
The White House said that taxpayers took the burden of none of the other requisites presented at the event .	-2.5459
A spokesman from Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in issuing the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.4404
HMX-1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to identify the exact costs of the event .	-2.7486
According to hour tariffs from the US Department of Defense for the financial year 2017 , however , the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight h.	-3.5264
Records of the unit record the aircraft 's flight time as 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-3.7329
The White House argues that the actual costs of helicopter operation are well below this rate .	-2.4731
" Setting the cost of taxpayers on the basis of estimates for the refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.1292
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in annual funds ' .	-2.4969
According to a RAND study dating back to 2015 , the refund rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take account of the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract signa.	-5.3559
At that time , the former press spokesman of the White House , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.2007
" The idea is to present things that are made in America this week , " said Spicer .	-1.9992
" And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people , are dependent on it .	-12.2194
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopters and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.1456
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise that . '	-2.5674
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour over the South Lawn for the event , but he was sitting in the driver ’ s seat of a fire car .	-4.5542
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky , joining the media about his own fleet of company products .	-12.2939
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said ' I have three of them ' .	-1.6023

How America can Hurt the OMV	-2.1624
Donald Trump really did not work happily when he signed Wednesday evening under the law to tighten up sanctions against Russia .	-3.0932
" In his hast to legislate " , Congress has packaged some " unconstitutional rules " , he estimated .	-3.7708
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels foamed against the US lead .	-3.0678
After all , the draft proposes punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-2.7080

Narco ’ s Staffel 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be placed at the centre of Netflix ’ s Hitrow	-4.1120
Despite the second season of Narcos , which reveals Pablo Escobars Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-2.8451
The sessions of three and four have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received its first trailer and showed the latest bad guys of the show .	-3.9277

Roll Backwards : The city recruits 46 kitchen aids	-3.1628
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again .	-2.9956
With fixed contacts for the children and an attribution to the team .	-3.0724
The clock is rotated back in the urban children 's daily care centres .	-3.4993
On September 1 , the city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children ’ s days facilities ( kitas ) back into its own direction .	-5.2829
For Sonja Pomeranz , Deputy Director for Youth Assistance , this is good news : " We are all very happy " .	-4.1164
Cooking is still out of the house : a caterer takes on this task and delivers freshly cooked cook.	-5.1195
The city operates in the Krefelder area 46 Children ’ s Day Care Centres , 44 children get a warm meal at lunch time .	-4.5038
In the last Kitajahr , 2800 children were on the tables , and needs grow steadily .	-4.2807
" Meanwhile , not only children who are maintained 45 hours a week in the kita at lunch , " explains Pomeranz .	-4.4376
" The offer is also valid in 35-hour care when children stay until 14 a.m. "	-9.3201
46 part-time forces have a kitchen service from 1 September : they heat the meals supplied , supplement them with salad , raw fruit and fruit , portioning the meal individually , spend the meal , dishwash , dishwash and clean the kitchen .	-5.7980
" The employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pomeranz .	-2.7396
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides the hour range .	-3.7505
" The kitchen helpers now belong firmly to the kita-team , " says Pomeranz satisfied .	-3.0176
" They are much more involved and it is easier for kitalization to implement educational concepts " .	-3.4429
It is also a question of healthy diets and cooking teachings .	-3.0802
" Children are supposed to help prepare food . "	-10.7205
The direct connection of the kitchen to the team makes sense .	-2.5230
For children , too .	-2.0376
" They have a known force in the Kita , a person familiar to them , not constantly changing people " .	-3.3508
This continuity is important for children .	-1.2463
The cleansing of the kita rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .	-4.4898
This variant - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has emerged as the most economical in the press office , in addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen performance .	-5.7991
And that , although 46 part-time forces are recruited .	-2.5245
" But these hours are not so strong in the weight of some 750 people in the educational sector , " says Sonja Pomerance .	-4.3702

Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl .	-2.7547
According to police information , the men spoke to the 13-year-olds who stopped with friends on the Kolping Road against 14.55 a.m. because they wanted to call the girl 's mobile phone .	-5.6318
The 13-year-old rejected the request and continued with their friends .	-2.9958
One of the perpetrators then tried to seize the mobile phone and the necklace of the girl , but that was misleading .	-4.9781

GMB Concern about investment in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-1.9300
A trade union would like to assure McVitie ’ s managers of the Biskuit manufacturer about the long-term commitment to production in her plant in Glasgow .	-4.2782
GMB Scotland said that the company weighed about the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-2.4074
More than 500 employees work in the plant producing hobnobs and Rich Tea Kekse among other products .	-2.9186
McVities owner Pladis said he has invested more than 5 million pounds in recent years .	-1.9123
He added that employees and trade union representatives would be " experienced first " if their activities changed .	-2.7576
In a letter to the head of the company , GMB Scotland McVitie called on ' to express concerns that funding for modernizing production lines would not be pushed forward ' .	-16.5216
GMB senior organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross deeply affects our members .	-2.9802
Generations of families have worked here and the workforce focuses strongly on the local community and the Glasgow area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-3.8118
Therefore , from the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , rising costs of living and chronic production declines , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous production presence at McVitie .	-11.6527
A spokesman from Pladis said : " The leader at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it , because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-4.4103
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with employees and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some questions were discussed openly .	-2.8328
We discussed with the employees that , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , we are constantly checking our businesses - and this applies to all our business areas and locations - in order to remain competitive .	-4.3433
She added : " In recent years we have invested more than 5 million pounds in our Tollcross site , especially in production lines and operational improvements .	-2.3824
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operating processes change at the site , the employees and their trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-4.4546
Has the PSG Barcelona warned about Neymar three years ago ?	-1.6512
The Site of La Liga may regret her interest in Marco Verratti	-2.2336
Paris Saint-Germain will not relax in her persecution of Neymar after submitting an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ?	-4.0752

After finishing , Neymar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the highest paid professional sportsman .	-8.6367
Barcelona is angry about the way Neymar has forced its way out , although a source close to the Catalan Board insists that the club has always done its best to take care of it since its arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-3.8064
But was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?	-2.0642
When Manchester City expressed interest in the signing of Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for every club who wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.3644
" I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al Khelaifi .	-2.6569
" We respect all clubs .	-0.8280
But if they try to sign one of our players , that will have consequences . '	-2.7413
Barcelona appears to have gone beyond this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG Midfield player Marco Verratti earlier this summer .	-9.6336
PSG made it clear that they would not allow International Italy to depart under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-3.1896

The Regensburg Domspatzen report on cases of abuse discharges Pope brother Georg Ratzinger . people talk a lot about things around in the .	-14.8488
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-1.7865
The final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg Domspatzen continues to provide discussions .	-3.1032
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , explained after publication towards the Deutsche Press Agency , he expected the former Regensburg bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emerited Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.6146
It would serve the reputation of the Catholic Church very much if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret about their own omissions or their then false assessment of the events .	-13.1339
The vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " , on the other hand , criticized that the reporting of violence in the dompathies was measured with ' double standards ' .	-4.7215
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , no one doubts that these are ' shameful and shameful acts ' that should be penalised and prevented in the future ; but the ' degree of media manipulation ' , such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national bioethics committee .	-4.3880
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider that normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-3.4193
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also meant in the interview with the Bavarian radio : " You like to go to the church and this is a found feet " .	-4.5403
She also pointed out that in her youth ' strikes were a normal educational means ' to deal with children like me ' .	-4.0403
They would find it unfair to apply today 's standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-2.8654
In connection with the reports on abuses , Pope brother Georg Ratzinger has often appeared .	-3.3907
Completely wrong , means author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the memory tape " My Brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) with Ratzinger .	-3.8582
" I must protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-3.0023
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the Enlightenment Attorney , Ulrich Weber , who was appointed by Bistom Regensburg ?	-4.1126
A total of 547 Regensburg domspatzen were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domspats were sexually abused .	-3.8123
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994 , says : ' Summarizing that in many cases forms of physical and mental violence have been applied by Domkapellmeister R.	-6.2763
Especially with high emotionality , punishment for pupils could be more violent .	-13.2443
Nevertheless , unlike many other accused persons , it is clear that many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him , despite violence .	-4.6775
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal in the Regensburg domspatzen Georg Ratzinger discharges his opinion .	-4.0460
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on the ' incidents of violence in protection commands at the Regensburg Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of the domkapell master Georg Ratzinger .	-4.4174
Firstly , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-2.0154
Secondly , he also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist who became handy to the often when a domspatz did not perform top musically .	-5.1396
How do you regard this final report as its biographer ?	-2.0826
Michael Hesemann : if you take the trouble and read the entire 440 pages of report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself more about why Georg Ratzinger is called it at all .	-5.4920
He is dedicated just eight pages and he is clearly released from any suspicion of complicity or science in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.9010
The excesses of violence at the pre-school also occurred outside its effectiveness .	-3.3041
At best , he can be accused of learning too late or not taking seriously enough initial suggestions .	-3.9131
The domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was found by virtually all the respondents than - so literally - " redemption " , " heaven " and " better world " .	-4.3389
For example , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger expresses an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as an extremely good teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons and " always circulated by grapes of children " .	-5.2708
Only a minority complains about his perfectionism and high emotionality , which has already resulted in anger erup.	-3.7821
That he collapsed not only with chairs and threw the key collection on the ground , but also distributed ear cows and too happy boys to the hair or ears , he admitted , deeply regretted and apologised for years ago .	-6.2637
However , in terms of rescuing his honour , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960 ’ s and 1970 ’ s , among parents like teachers .	-5.0487
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-1.6449
Of course , I think each of us who was born before 1968 .	-1.7369
I have also seen this in a secular school , a state school .	-2.9461
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and the excesses of violence at school , these are , of course , bagatelles .	-4.1033
There is already a question as to whether it is not more likely to do with his familiarity and role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen to him .	-5.7415
After all , the Bavarian Pope is still working hard for many who have never understood it .	-4.2705
The truth is , however , that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-2.6732
The media reported a great deal of abuse in the Regensburg domspatzen in connection with the report .	-3.5173
Will Georg Ratzinger also be charged with any involvement or co-science in the final report with regard to sexual abuse ?	-3.6818
Michael Hesemann : clearly no .	-1.3745
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual attacks claims to have entrusted to the Chapel Master .	-2.6878
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.3032
" I never dared to talk to my father or mother about it , " said one person who was affected by deputy for the others , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-16.1495
The real problem with educating sexual abuse was , and is , that most victims remain silent .	-3.7677
If they did not even entrust parents and brothers , then certainly not a choir manager who would have been a colleague of the perpetrators in a sense .	-4.5276
How do students assess Ratzinger 's role as regards abuse cases ?	-3.5843
Michael Hesemann : A surveyed student put it this way : " Regarding sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) could have had timely findings and had stopped the perpetrator .	-4.3556
I think it ... also really absurd to assume that it is calculated ... letters have opened more strongly or more clearly than their parents , heads of boarding schools , trust teachers , etc .	-6.0076
That one talks to him about sex ... - unthinkable ' .	-2.1392
Thus , the report comes to the very clear outcome : ' That students and / or their surroundings affected in the run-up to the study could not be confirmed ' .	-5.5841
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free to speak of every co-science .	-3.3851
Nor can he be accused of not preventing or displaying it .	-2.5508
There is therefore no reason to link its good name to these reluctant crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.5843
In the media , a lot of " violent texts " was read in the rainforest dompathies with.	-12.8419
The former chapel chapel Georg Ratzinger is accused of in the report ' Wegschauen ' .	-3.4283
Should he live with this accusation ?	-2.0440
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed up in the reporting and mixed into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excesses of violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.3781
That , however , is an abuse of the report .	-2.6779
There is a clean separation : between the pre-school and the school of the Domspatzen , between sexual abuse and texts of violence and , let us say , other allegations .	-5.0715
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , in other words four decades , when Georg Ratzinger was not choirman of the Cathedral .	-4.6669
The whole terrible educational teaching , the cases where boys were harassed and painted by sadistic teachers and suffered horrifically , all took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where really scandalous conditions had to be prevailed .	-6.1223
But Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he got the boys to face only when they were already on the Domspatzengymnasium .	-4.4053
As most witnesses pointed out , the subject of " school " was taboo .	-3.3181
One was only happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-2.9182
What was different from the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-3.1085
Michael Hesemann : There was discipline , but no sadistic violence .	-2.1951
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims valued the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even positive memories with him ' .	-3.5873
At most , the accusation of having looked away remains .	-3.8781
However , despite all efforts , the report could define only two periods in which it was reported by the conditions at pre-school . thbubuilding builbuilbubuilbuilbubu. bubububu	-13.9759
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and wanted to hear nothing from what happened at a school at which he was not working and responsible ( so the witnesses ) , and then only again around 1993 .	-4.9183
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close the ears before the states ?	-2.7398
Michael Hesemann : No , because as early as 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domspatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-2.9031
He points out to them that ' the caning sentence will continue to be practised in the school ' .	-4.4990
Even given the risk of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-2.3876
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity existed when caning sentences were long prohibited in Bavaria .	-2.9550
Before that , they happened in a legal grey area , as each of us probably know .	-3.2192
It was difficult for him to estimate where the people concerned might have been excessive or dramatised and where the permissible limit was really exceeded .	-4.5292
You cannot say that he has always looked away .	-2.7556
That is simply not true .	-1.2030
Only in 1980 the caning sentence at schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-2.7170
Fürstin Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to the time then .	-3.6056
How do you see that ?	-1.5726
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " case stroke of anachronism " , i.e. the danger of evaluating past moral standards .	-14.2791
The Prince is already right there .	-2.3975
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was disgusting at all times , nor to what was broken in the pre-school of revenge and violence in innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond what was usual at the time . arar.	-15.3731
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being revised .	-2.8858
At the same time , however , I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.7375
His means of disciplining and punishing , that is to say ear figs and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-3.6628
When physical punishment was then banned , it was also strictly adhered to .	-3.3351
What image of his rainbourg time did Georg Ratzinger reproduce in talks with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-3.0896
Has the question of caning been raised ?	-3.7030
Michael Hesemann : Well , in the book the life of his brother Joseph , Pope Benedict XVI , tells us from his perspective , where the domspats played only a side role .	-4.2072
Nevertheless , I certainly do not conceal the fact that he had a strict regime there .	-4.0123
But this must also be said : without this perfectionism , without demanding absolute discipline , it would have been hardly possible for him to form an institution of world transformation from the rather nationally known Regensburg domspatzen to date , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-5.6978
With biscuits and bonbons alone , one makes no major singers out of contradictory boys , and every success , whatever area , but always discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-5.9147
What kind of people have you experienced Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-3.7212
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg Ratzinger quite well and repeatedly experienced Georg Ratzinger as a wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deeply believed and heart-good people , who cannot imagine that he could do something just a fly .	-5.9940
I receive regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him like a member of his family 23 years after his emerition .	-3.3857
So those who still do not forgive him that he was strict to them are clearly in the minority .	-3.5450
Most dom patterns are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing them the world of music .	-3.5634
And that he was always a good father teacher - a strict father , certainly that may be - but also a lovely respectful person to whom she is still looking at today and whom she worships .	-5.6180
And please , once again , make it quite clear that everything accused of him is educational methods that were at that time on the agenda .	-12.1913
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-2.0548
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make a media scapegoat .	-2.4683
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious .	-2.6362
The report that has just been published discharges it .	-2.0832
Now the decency would be to leave a 93-year-old man who has acquired great merit and without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps Germany , perhaps no one would know the Regensburg domspatzen finally in peace .	-5.6081
