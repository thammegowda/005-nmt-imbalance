Gutach : More safety for pedestrians	-1.4625
There are no 100 meters from each other . On Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lights were put into operation at the village car park - in view of the older town hall lights .	-5.7348
Two equipment so close to each other : Do you intend or couple of citizens ?	-4.0428
This question was answered clearly by Mr Mayer yesterday .	-2.3818
" The Rathausampel was installed at that time because it secured the school path , " explained Eckert yesterday .	-3.6376
The Kluser traffic lights ensure both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain people .	-3.7191
The complex officially operated yesterday is important for the crossroads of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-3.2756
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of traffic from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-2.6338
" Another traffic light was needed during the high traffic and pedestrian volumes , " says Eckert .	-4.5794
This also confirms Peter Arnold from the Offenburg council office .	-2.3700
" According to current measurements on the B 33 , about 12 000 vehicles daily pass through the municipality of Gutach , about ten percent of which are heavy traffic , " emphasises Arnold .	-4.4189
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : ' Safety is just going on here ' , says Arnold .	-4.1994
Altogether , four traffic shows were carried out , a roundabout was also considered , but because of the narrow slopes in the crossroads of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-17.9476
According to Arnold , everything has been tested at the location of the traffic lights : " By means of an extra long traffic traffic traffic loaded for us , we have determined whether these vehicles can exit from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knitting the traffic lights " .	-7.3178
The some 15 000 euro traffic light itself is the " most modern thing that currently exists on the market " , explained Arnold .	-4.0959
The complex is equipped with coloured LEDs , which shine so strongly that the lights of drivers , for example , can be seen in the event of deep sun .	-5.3660
And sparsely it is also : the older light systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-3.8489
There are three light systems per direction .	-1.7926
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant : it is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.6530
If the pedestrian presses the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic si.	-2.5558
If the road is free , comes immediately green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds . . fffff. fffffff	-14.4721
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated .	-2.5434
" If a group or disabled people go through the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be sure about the road " , explained Arnold .	-4.3665
Of course , the drivers need to think here as partners and watch the road . ft!	-12.7205
This was not the case yesterday : hardly showed the lights for pedestrians green , a upper class vehicle rushed through - with shining red .	-4.0623
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the hardship of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-2.4750
The disasters of his Catholic village childhood - the language , the slope too raw violence and blunt sexuality , the close and joyless - have often described the Carinthian poet .	-10.8949
The Büchner Prize winner is known above all as a prosauthor , and theatre texts are rare in his work .	-3.5204
Collage from prosatexten Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prosatextensions for his performance " weather lights on the top " , which is now available in Garage X at Peter Square .	-5.4021
The theatre maker , for example , connects elements from the autobiographically novel " Der Leigene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family regrettable " ( 2003 ) .	-4.3583
The eight-headed ensemble is largely empty on the stage - an important requisite : a scuba , on which it is convinced and masturbated - fish through the text material .	-6.5267
Director Fresacher seems to have little confidence in the text .	-2.7278
The 70-minute performance overtones the template with a wealth of direct incidents , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms of game .	-4.0828
Especially the actresses come up with sometimes questionable scenes .	-4.5806
They are hardly captured , with the head immersed under water , tacked with their evening samples on the wall .	-5.2685
Forced into cellophane or tenants , they stack on dangerously high sticks through the production , either monologize them loudly or are completely silenced on the stage floor .	-4.9196
The text , however , scarcely conveys itself in this effort .	-3.2191
The best moments have the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular song .	-3.3338
Only towards the end , the overturned performance comes somewhat quiet , and anglers flash up absurd humor .	-6.0386
A Blackbox in the car ?	-1.4099
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining highway system , and believe that the solution has been found in a small black box that can be found in the armature board of each car .	-4.4066
The devices that record every kilometre and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the outdated system of financing US roads .	-3.8379
The normally rather boring territory of road planning has suddenly sparked an intensive debate with colorful alliances fol.	-11.6798
Libertarians have allied with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax modes .	-4.0295
The Tea Party is appalled .	-1.4812
The American Civil Law Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of concerns about data protection . articles about arart .	-11.4329
But , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.9286
They are currently examining how to switch to a system over the next ten years , where drivers are paying per mile .	-4.5373
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-1.9370
That really is a must for our country .	-1.4729
“ It is nothing we may only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the miles driven by all Californian drivers in the state from 2025 .	-3.9896
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.3947
The technology for this is there .	-1.4979
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from taxes , pays US Americans at the fuel pillar , is broken .	-3.9672
But America no longer fuels as much as before .	-2.5849
Cars use less gasoline .	-1.2541
The government oil tax of 18.4 cents per Gallone ( less than 4 Eurocent per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-2.6975
Politicians , at high prices , do not dare to raise the tax just to one cent .	-3.8107
“ The gasoline tax is simply not viable for the future , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota . . mmmpear.	-11.2412
Its state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-2.5071
“ This is the long-term most sensible alternative , ” he said .	-1.8558
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-1.4905
It is no surprise that the idea of urban liberals is accepted , because the tax , for example , could be used to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust gases are reduced .	-4.0916
California ’ s planners are relying on the system of developing policies aimed at achieving the ambitious , legally enshrined objectives of the federal state on climate change .	-4.3927
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , also stated that he sees it as the most viable long-term alternative .	-15.4546
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also done by the idea of allowing drivers to pay after track .	-3.9024
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Reason ’ s policy .	-2.7515
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.1674
The movement is also supported by two former American transport ministers , who , in a report in 2011 , called on Congress to move towards mile-based settlement .	-11.4753
The US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project last year , which would have included 10,000 cars .	-2.8456
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the push and thus responded to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas representing people who often have to travel many miles on their way to work or to the city .	-4.9679
Nevertheless , several states and big cities are moving in that direction on their own .	-3.1370
The most committed is Oregon , which currently promotes 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s largest experiment .	-3.4065
These drivers will soon pay mileage fees instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .	-2.7619
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.9669
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-1.6368
Illinois tests it limited with lorries .	-10.0901
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the transport ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-2.9961
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.1335
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue every movement .	-3.3491
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , head of strategy and result management in the transport ministry of Nevada .	-3.2756
People did not want it .	-0.9897
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachographs into sophisticated monitoring equipment . ”	-3.4123
There is no need to build a gigantic , locked technological infrastructure , which would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-3.0339
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that enables the state to capture the kilometres driven , but not exactly when and where .	-4.1296
The public , Khan said , would be more reassured .	-3.2370
The hunt for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in Calcoun.	-10.8736
The company originally did not start to help states tax drivers .	-2.8062
Instead , its aim was to foot in an emerging market for car insurance , where drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles driven .	-4.3741
But the devices it has tested are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is uploaded regularly via modem .	-3.8407
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and sites are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-2.8862
Some of these public pilot programs have made major mistakes .	-2.1644
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways to implement this .	-1.7099
In Oregon , the planners experiment with giving car drivers a range of options .	-3.0677
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.6405
Or they choose no device at all and pay a flat rate instead based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state .	-4.0259
Others hope to sell the concept of a mistrust public by providing the devices with more functions than with fewer .	-2.9539
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a tax device that also pays parking fees , pays insurance only for kilometres driven and speed data collected by other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion .	-5.1687
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages that the system offers , ” says it in a planning document of the city .	-3.4244
However , some transport planners are wondering whether the whole talk about payment per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre .	-10.8182
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , officials declared that Congress could simply solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel taxes .	-3.3318
An additional one-off fee or an annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol , so that they also pay a fair share .	-3.5801
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of the Commission ’ s legislative and public affairs .	-3.1956
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things .	-2.7364
Royal Field : Small Team Bats Wacker	-2.4402
The voluntary fire brigade handled its autumn test despite lack of staff with Bravour .	-3.9390
Only eleven man participated in the exercise .	-1.6322
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property feather in Burgberger Strasse in his practice .	-3.8165
A short decision was made when sawing there .	-13.4688
Two people were injured by the fire emerging and smoking development , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-4.1933
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two respirators of the Wehre were prepared to enter the building .	-3.9084
After a short period of time , it was possible to find the first person and guide them into free .	-4.2127
The second person had to be worn .	-1.2462
This was not so easy as to overcome a narrow staircase .	-2.9288
The building , a workshop with integrated stability for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.4440
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it .	-2.2653
There were also electrical machines for wood processing .	-3.0892
The first extinguishing attack was done by tank in the vehicle .	-2.3392
Another management took place via an overflow hydrant at about 100 meters distance .	-3.8336
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed .	-2.4014
A hollow tube was also used in the building .	-3.5728
Hans Kammerer also showed what to do with little staff available .	-4.0988
In the event of seriousness , assistance is provided via the Königsfeld Day Working Group .	-4.2450
The commander was satisfied with the exercise process .	-2.3393
Important networking of universities and companies	-2.2212
On his visit to the Breisgau-Hochwarzwald district , Landtag President Guido Wolf was also informed in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce comes from tomorrow .	-4.0256
At the Förderzentrum Hochwarzwald , he dealt with this important question , together with the Managing Directors of Vocational Schools , as well as the circle symnasium and the parental board chairmen .	-5.9920
" Education is an important location factor " , underscored Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , who presented the networked school project Hochblack Forest .	-3.5804
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for training .	-2.5488
Since 2011 , there has been successful cooperation in the forest town between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and Vocational School Centre .	-4.0793
He also praised family friendliness in the country .	-12.5147
" It is important not only to have a family phase in mind , but also to have the phase of care for relatives because of demographic change , " explained Wolf .	-4.4295
He also stated that more and more workers were concerned about the care and care of their families .	-3.9826
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees may lead to an end to employment , " said Wolf .	-3.1091
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers , he continued to say .	-2.2825
Another , particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.2605
" Whoever has met the benefits of the region during his studies remains often convinced , with his acquired knowledge and skills , of the regional economy , which helps to strengthen the region , " the president of the country was convi.	-5.7399
Only if sufficient training places were offered could the professional needs be met .	-4.0545
In his opinion , the advantage of the district is its advantageous location in southwest Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.4723
In addition , on his train journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport .	-3.7238
" Stay stubbornly and make public transport better , " he explained to the local politicians present .	-3.5477
With music experienced an entertaining afternoon	-2.4859
For 15 years , the Kaul family has invited the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vesper .	-3.1669
In the past , the elderly were hosted in the restaurant .	-2.9537
This afternoon takes place in St. Josef Pflegeheim .	-3.3595
The inhabitants look forward to the tasty cakes and cakes .	-3.0459
Later , there was sausage salad .	-2.1922
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich maintained with common melodies .	-2.3507
The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e is to be put back on the reconstruction cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-5.2052
In the days before the kilbig , during the first works of renovation of the front school courtyard , a small angle wall was installed to stabilize and static discharge the natural stone wall with Balustrade over a hundred years old .	-4.8715
Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbauamt provides for the following procedures to include the Landenkmalamt in the planning and to create a refurbishment concept for the old Wall .	-6.5412
Subsequently , a cost calculation is to be carried out by professionals , who will then be put on the table to the Council for the decision and definition of the follow-up profor the .	-7.0822
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-2.1113
After the refurbishment , plastering and tree planting of the old school courtyard within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 , the follow-up measure , the restructuring wall needed from scratch , must be reconstructed and placed on new underground .	-7.0153
The historical , one hundred years old demarcation wall of the old school court to the church road , is mainly due to water and frost damage , since there is no drainage needed and has an archery tendency forward .	-5.4251
Deep cracks in individual stones are witnessing damage to weather , but the wall is currently not at risk of ff.	-12.8665
A steady wall is a prerequisite for a student using school court , which has been done through the current fortification works .	-5.1757
Originally , school of-refurbishment was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure produced a shift .	-4.3469
An important word on historical school walls , which has already been used for film recordings , will take part in the list of national monuments .	-5.4575
Should targets come from this site , the city hopes to hold bräunlingen on subsidies from the monuments protectors .	-5.7310
The students at the Bräunlinger Principal School , who are now being teached in a well-renovated old school building with new aula , can soon use the old school house .	-4.8246
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart	-2.2276
In the ongoing discussions about the future of music universities in Baden-Württemberg , Cem <unk>zdemir , German Chairman of the Greens , has now also become involved .	-4.0660
" I think it is wrong to abandon holistic training at Stuttgart University of Music , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.0751
Jazz and classics are part of the jazz location of Stuttgart .	-3.0042
This means that <unk>zdemir , who is in Stuttgart favorite for a direct mandate at the German election on September 22 , is the Green Red Government .	-4.8232
On the basis of an expert study , this promotes a reorganization of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-15.0062
Then , among other things , the course of study Jazz and Pop will be shifted from the Stuttgart Musikhochschule to the Mannheim University of Musikhochschule .	-5.0228
US Border Discovered ' Super Tunnel ' to Drug Smuggling	-2.7645
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and decommissioned a super tunnel to drug smuggling .	-2.7745
As the US customs authorities said , the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks and a ventilation system .	-3.4255
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.1725
According to the data , the tunnel had not yet been used .	-2.4605
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar , " said the General Prosecutor of the US District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a San Diego storehouse where this had been discovered an end to the tunnel .	-4.4202
Duffy used to the drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.3160
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drug cartels .	-2.2388
Since 2006 , more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-11.0673
Constructed by Experts	-1.3190
Because of the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that he was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took up around a year .	-15.0473
The track system was equipped with electrically operated cars .	-2.8665
On the Mexican side , access is located in a building 80 meters from the border .	-2.7675
According to the authorities , a head of 20 metres leads into the depth of the actual tunnel entraentra.	-3.9062
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimetres width .	-2.7609
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the US .	-2.6492
Two of the suspects have been arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-14.4627
The third , a Mexican , was taken for confiscated marijuanas .	-10.2175
All three are threatened as the maximum punishment of lifelong imprisonment , as civil servants have said .	-3.5490
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , the press conference in San Diego has continued .	-1.9889
But it is the first time that such tunnel building has found cocaine .	-3.2337
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not tunnels .	-2.2012
This shows the " desperation " of the drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug flag in San Diego .	-3.6539
They would do everything they can to get to the US .	-2.1171
No details were given to those arrested , at least one was Mexican .	-2.7815
They have to count on prison sentences of up to ten years .	-2.6633
2014 Geisinger ’ s Festival	-2.0439
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-1.7195
Returning to the first informal mention is becoming ever closer .	-4.0710
When the year comes to an end in good eight weeks , the anniversary year will come to an end .	-3.9524
Hospitals and church houses were first mentioned in a clear way 794 .	-4.8632
A document was made in churches , in which both places are mentioned .	-3.3982
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and as Geisingen currently has no hall , this event will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-4.6460
A number of events are planned in Geisingen as well as in church houses .	-3.6526
Church houses will be 1250 in July at a festival weekend from July 18th to 20th .	-3.6230
Return to celebrate .	-2.0742
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church valley .	-2.9046
This weekend is also the Church House Festival .	-3.5234
Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city during the anniversary of the city , which is lifor .	-6.7046
On 21 June together with the Sonnwendfeier of the Black Forest Association , on 12 July in the Arena with fireworks and on 13 December the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-3.7062
This is completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date is last September 's weekend , on 27 and 28 September .	-3.6337
A new chronicle is also published on the occasion of the Geisinger city anniversary .	-2.9586
" However , a chronicle should not only be made by Geisingen himself , but a printed work about today 's minds , which consists of Geisingen , Church Hausen , Leipferdingen , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen , " says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-5.4780
And the Geisingen of today celebrates birthday in 2014 , and in 1974 the present space was performed with the communities .	-4.5054
The new chronicle will be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on 21 or 22 November .	-2.5894
But 2014 is another year with many anniversaries .	-2.4969
The foolish Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a customs platform during its 60th anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will celebrate the Festival Banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the District Music Festival from May 1 to 4 .	-11.7080
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen will be 40 years old , the Geisinger Schule has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Well Festival from 4 to 7 July .	-4.6803
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation certificate owned by the St. Gallen monastery in 764 .	-3.0315
The certificate was manufactured in churches ( houses ) which was then the court .	-10.9753
Both communities are therefore mentioned in the same certificate .	-2.0249
As a result of 2014 this 1250-year-old celebration , in addition , the local reform is 40 years back .	-5.2465
The Council is targeting track plants	-2.7191
Should the transition " Am Herschen " be converted to increase road safety ?	-3.7747
Yes , the municipalities have decided .	-1.4823
Schiltach must take EUR 220 000 into account .	-2.5557
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-2.3802
In particular , safety at railway transitions is to be increased - there are regular collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany .	-5.3887
If the communities agree to conversion measures , they must participate with a third in the cost , the rest share the railway and the covenant .	-4.8129
Schiltach 's municipal champion Roland Grie<unk>haber explained the specific characteristics of the transition " Am Hirschen " .	-11.5708
The city is planning to build a booking at the height of the Tunnelmund west of the railway track .	-4.8420
There , too , larger vehicles , such as those transporting longwood , could stand in counter-traffic without having to block the track .	-3.9448
Greetholders therefore proposed to construct a necessary support wall in such a way that the city could widen the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-4.4757
This was discussed in the Council of Municipalities controversially , since some Councils doubted the need for road spreading : Thomas Kipp , with his expression , put the mood of critics on the point : ' Do we need to take so much money because of so few vehicles ? '	-14.1856
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted that the transition to " deer " was used regularly for long wood transport .	-4.4775
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported over this route because the up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn there into the main road .	-4.5157
Moreover , the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles who cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , argued Haas .	-3.8016
Beyond the fact that the Kirchberg and Schlossberg tunnels would have to be rebuilt and refurbished , as is currently the case in Wolfach , the railway transition " Am " deer " could also be important for a longer period of time .	-6.2018
The Councils agreed to investigate the costs of broadening the road intended .	-3.4145
Regardless of this , the majority agreed to the transition to the railway transition with the measure that the necessary support walls were built in such a way that the city could extend the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " to around 5.5 meters if necessary .	-6.2737
By contrast , the transition to Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a very different problem concerning access to the highly rising " Geroltzhäuser Path " .	-5.0382
The administration had investigated the conversion plans of the railway from the Breinlinger engineering agency , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser way would be possible without further delay .	-5.1035
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not possible to rule out the fact that road tendencies could lead to longer vehicles being seated .	-5.7523
The responsibility for this , in turn , carries the city as a street carrier .	-4.2534
The reconstruction could therefore result in liability disputes .	-2.5680
Since both wooden turns and turning off in the current state of development have worked , you should not agree to the transition of the railway , argued Haas .	-17.6155
At this point , too , the risk of a collision of train with a transitional vehicle much lower than the other railway transitions , because there is a good visibility connection right next to the middle .	-14.5345
Even trains from the main railway station would have to be slowed down here so far that no collision threatens .	-10.6864
The majority of them refused to approve the transition of this railway transition , since the city of Schiltach had to " build up " the problem with seating vehicles , so the councils , because the railway could withdraw from the responsibility after the construction work has been completed .	-7.6804
The board considers the conversions to the transitions " Pre-Heubach " and " Pre-Kuhbach " for which cross-related agreements have already been made with the railway .	-5.5975
Esa decides on major space missions : missions for billions	-2.0869
Far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to start over the next few years .	-9.0153
Thirty proposals were selected , five are still in the race .	-2.5962
Far worlds .	-1.0146
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-1.8514
Whether there are at least some of them life no one knows .	-2.6250
The selection is difficult : Should you search for gravitational waves ?	-10.7688
Or rather explore the origin of cosmos ?	-2.5563
Or walked after similar planets , perhaps discovering outside life ?	-4.3459
These questions are particularly the leaders of the European Space Agency Esa .	-2.8567
For its " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are designed to make progress in research .	-3.8992
The budget for such ' L missions ' is approximately EUR 1 billion .	-2.3556
The start will probably be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.7069
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-2.0764
30 ideas have been discussed , five of them have now come into the tighter election .	-3.6851
Many bodies are examining the proposals , studying researchers .	-3.7034
Over the next few days , a final decision will be made by the Scientific Programme Committee .	-2.5157
A total of four major questions have been selected by the Esa , to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme will find answers .	-4.8256
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.4445
The exact processes in the creation of stars made of large clouds of gas - and thus also the emergence of planets circulating these stars - are still in the proverbial dark .	-4.8988
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this dark .	-2.3714
And if a star has planets under which circumstances can life occur ?	-3.0753
To look into this question , the 2017 Space Telescope " Cheops " will start , with the 500 already known planetary systems in our closer environment .	-4.8365
But the opportunities are limited , cheops are a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.6484
With larger instruments , astronomers could illustrate similar planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , seeking " biomarkers " : gases that are considered indicative of biological activity .	-4.0501
How does the solar system work ?	-0.8677
This question , too , should ultimately provide information about the conditions for the emergence of lif.	-4.6059
An important role is the magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation with the planetary system that it emer.	-10.8852
In our solar system , these processes can be examined exemplarily .	-3.5031
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already granted a mission of the M class ( where the budget lies at around half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.0781
The probe will start in 2017 and watch surface and activity of the sun closely .	-3.3926
Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest to researchers .	-2.5955
They want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-2.5201
For this , Esa provides for the first of the three L missions of the " Cosmic Vision " program. for .	-14.7748
The song " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-2.7381
Eight years later , it reaches Jupiter and is intended to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-3.3105
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.1030
The world offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to investigate whether the natural laws we know are still valid there .	-4.2564
Perhaps even deviations that could point the physicists to a new theory , under which all the well-known natural laws can be united .	-5.3115
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of ?	-3.0671
Our cosmos was born 13.7 billion years ago by the bang .	-10.5299
In addition to the common matter that consists of stars , planets and living creatures like us , there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy , through which the expansion of the world accelerates .	-5.0454
So far , researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the bang nor what dark matter and dark energy consists of .	-3.8834
With " Euclid " the Esa has already granted an M mission here , which is planned for 2020 .	-4.6589
With a special telescope , the sound is intended to examine the distribution of the material in the universe for the first time throughout the sky , thus allowing conclusions on the nature of darker matter and darker energy .	-4.4328
Who could race	-8.8436
Of the 30 proposals , only two will be left at the end of the selection procedure .	-2.1233
The best opportunities for granting an authorization as L mission is , in the opinion of many experts , ' E-Lisa ' , a demanding concept for detecting gravitational waves .	-13.2843
Physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-3.2926
They have not been proved yet .	-2.1043
Elisa could manage that , hoping the scientists behind the project .	-2.9462
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three sounds , which is stationed in all .	-3.3057
Unlike plants on Earth , he could also prove gravitational waves that were created during the bang , thus providing new insights into the emergence of cosmos .	-5.2745
Four other proposals compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which , among other things , is to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the external planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " to trace and examine similar planets .	-4.4822
Among other things , proposals on the sample return transport from Mars , research into moon , venus and asteroids and sun-physics have already been excluded .	-5.1002
Snowden willing to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance	-2.2668
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US secret service , has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and tell the German Bundestag if the US National Security Agency and her director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities .	-4.1817
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-9.0777
In a letter from Snowden , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Ströbele , he writes : “ Even though the outcome of my efforts was proven positive , my government continues to treat a different opinion as a breakdown , trying to criminalise political expression with threat , in which no defense is possible . ”	-5.3728
Truth to say is not a crime .	-2.1261
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community could convince the American Government to let the charges fall against him .	-12.8177
The charges made by the US Department of Justice include spying and theft of state property .	-2.7796
The German Minister for the Interior , Hans-Peter Friedrich , has said to you online : “ If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak to German representatives , then we find ways to make that possible . ”	-4.3784
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has heard Chancellor Angela Merkel 's phone .	-3.1809
Thomas Oppermann , the honourable Member who led the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , declared that the opportunity should be taken to listen to Snowden as witnesses , if possible , ‘ without jeopardising it and ruining relations with the US ’ .	-14.9501
Ströbele , a Green Member , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.2154
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.5814
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he left the country .	-2.6318
If Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe , ” he says .	-3.1437
In his letter , Snowden explains that he was exposed to a “ serious and continuous ” persecution campaign that displaced him from his homeland .	-3.3627
However , it is affected by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.6383
Citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive monitoring as a merit of the general public .	-3.5733
In his letter , Snowden makes the German authorities an offer of cooperation , “ if the difficulties around the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-2.5441
Frontier Airlines charges for hand luggage	-1.1826
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who want to stay on their flight hand baggage .	-3.2632
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday was read that passengers should keep the whole dose .	-3.7925
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .	-2.8146
Frontier explained that you calculate $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 on travellers who only paid at the flight .	-4.1577
Frontier spokesman Kate O 'Malley said that the $ 100 charge was aimed at moving travellers to take care of the payment beforehand .	-3.9429
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.1464
In 2008 airlines started to charge for the first and second checked baggage .	-3.3322
Passengers who tried to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into their hand baggage , which means that baggage frequently overfilled over the seat .	-4.9781
Charges are one way of moving passengers to take less on board .	-3.0167
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-2.0916
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier who would have expressed clearly that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the company above the seat .	-4.4453
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-2.4379
This means that a passenger may take a piece of baggage free of charge at the Frontier flight , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a comparable baggage .	-3.7668
O 'Malley explained that the site of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the fee before they come to the flight .	-3.8874
Frontier 's new hand baggage fee will only enter into force in summer , and there is no exact date yet .	-4.0811
Passengers often ship over baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines like to return to them .	-3.8751
They argue that the baggage transport costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-2.8073
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of losses .	-3.2844
However , most people have so far left the fingers of hand baggage charges .	-3.9517
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested first fees for hand baggage three years ago and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-3.6978
The only other airline with such a charge was the Hungarian Wizz Air , declared the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional fees .	-4.0369
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand baggage charge Spirit brings $ 50 million annually .	-3.0495
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown with spirit and was curious what would expect him to pass if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage charge of the company .	-4.4741
“ The boarding process was among the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-2.6234
I expected to see teeth and handy discussions at the flight .	-2.6546
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-2.0846
Frontier also follows Spirit for the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.7241
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice should keep the whole dose and coffee is free of charge . free of ch! ! !!!!....	-10.7286
Water remains free .	-1.5084
In 2008 , US Airways sought to demand money for refreshment drinks , but reversed this seven months later , after passengers had complained and no other large society had drawn .	-4.8519
Frontier ’ s move to charge hand baggage charges if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-3.6150
Airlines pay online travel agencies like Orbitz 10 to 25 US dollars per ticket sold .	-2.5541
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to buy directly from them instead of via an online travel agent .	-10.1366
Frontier has , however , gone further in this area .	-9.7616
In September , the company began to award only half the miles of frequent flying when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.6336
On Wednesday , miles were reduced to 25 % of the flight route .	-2.4729
A flight travel booked by a third party with frontier over 1000 miles will therefore only introduce customers 250 miles .	-4.1346
Passengers may also reserve seats exclusively when purchasing directly on the Frontier website .	-3.4818
Frontier has a loyal customer base at his head office in Denver , but the business shrinks and the company loses money .	-3.1893
The proceeds fell by 9 % and air capacity shrinked almost 13 % in the first quarter , as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-3.5059
Republic has tried to control the finances of frontiers within the framework of the sale of society .	-3.6539
Sayings Come from the Bible	-2.5486
Some 40 women visited the last women 's breakfast this year in the Protestant church community of Bisingen .	-3.2752
The theme of the day in the municipality were " sayings from the Bible " and " Middle Ages speeches " .	-3.7029
Zita Köhler , chairman of the Church Community Council , entered into the Biblical proverbs after breakfast .	-3.2760
" Say words contain lifestyles , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-2.8178
She compared several sayings with the corresponding bible organizations and explained the importance .	-10.7400
She called sayings like : wood eyes is vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye to someone who gives his Lord in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-4.3349
Several times the speaker also advised her listeners what saying it was .	-3.7670
The speeches from the Middle Ages , Christel Dehner , took on board : All good things are three , blue , making .	-9.8948
She explained the importance and origin of the sayings she called ' bridges into the past ' .	-2.8082
A tombola was finally lost .	-1.9749

Learning Instead of Unemployment : Pilot project for Tourists	-2.9737
Today , a pilot project for the tourism industry starts at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte .	-3.6472
Under the leadership of the Federal Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as industry unlearned should be qualified over three winters to professionals for hotels and restauranfor rest.	-15.1119
" New is that the six-month courses end with degrees , " said Carmen Wiechert from the Neubrandenburg working agency .	-3.3407
The benefits are varied : the participants would not be unemployed , the companies would be trained professionals , who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the Agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-13.8276
The project also involves the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-3.0974
NSA states that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame the site ’ s crash	-3.2670
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that an error had paralyzed its public website several hours and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-3.9558
“ NSA.gov was not available for several hours tonight , as an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the Spionage Agency explained in an e-mail message .	-4.2986
The problem will be fixed this evening .	-1.3848
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDoS ) was not true .	-2.4442
In the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours , and that remains unaccessible to some users .	-4.0251
Previously , a NSA spokesman for ABC News declared that the authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.0723
Secret information is not in danger , so the speaker .	-2.0556
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.1512
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-2.6495
Cyber tactics are relatively simple and attacks do not help penetrate the internal network of the target system .	-2.7063
The previously super-secret NSA , whose nickname was No Such Agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the public ’ s bright light , and sees itself strongly criticised by the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive monitoring program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employee Edward Snowden .	-5.8899
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation . wiwiwithin a builbubuilding a building bu. builbubuilbuilding building a building .	-20.9208

Profit losses in Bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders	-3.0729
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % decline in net profit on Thursday , having been under pressure by declining orders and deliveries in aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the railway saving .	-4.6343
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also published no flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not give any new information about whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable next September .	-3.9940
On the Jungfernflight of the test aircraft , only three more starts so far , which makes it questionable whether the test phase will be as planned .	-5.2153
The results were lagging behind the forecasts and led to over eight percent of the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-3.8495
Cameron Doerksen , analyst at National Bank Financial , reduced its “ outperform ” assessment on Thursday to “ sector perform ” with a view to the fact that the share has limited course potential in the next one to two quarters .	-3.7652
“ While weaker supply figures were expected to a large extent in aircraft , margin development in the transport sector is clearly disappointed , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-4.1591
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries when the aircraft test program progresses .	-3.0054
If , however , no new orders are placed in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-3.3834
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.4054
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay .	-2.3185
But , so far , binding orders for the CSeries with 177 are moderate , as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims about fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new nozzle aircraft are appropriate .	-12.6229
There are currently a total of 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and comp. .	-9.7581
Chairman of the Executive Board Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his goal of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercicommerciuse of the jet . busibing bubs buil.	-10.8330
The management of the company also insured against analysts and media on Thursday , the programme is in the timetable .	-4.5867
“ The test aircraft has no longer remained on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft ’ s stand-time ground tests and software updates were set .	-10.1871
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.7561
We have decided to make a first flight and then to attach a revision period , which we have done .	-3.4095
This is done throughout the flight programme .	-1.9292
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining short afterwards , it was said by the company 's side .	-4.3764
Nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical whether twelve months after the maiden flight the first customer can operate an aircraft of CSeries .	-3.7505
Bombardier explained that it checks the start-up planning ( EIS ) and will update it in the next few month.	-10.3428
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if it appears to be Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is shifting to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-3.8189
In the third quarter , at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million or 8 cents per share of $ 172 million or 9 cents per share a year earlier .	-3.3019
The customized profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents .	-2.8035
Sales grew slightly and fell from 4.2 to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.6230
Analysts had expected a profit of $ 10 cent per share and $ 4.56 billion , says Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.9485
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-2.9044
The net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.6598
The order book in the aerospace part was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September and was therefore unchanged from 31 December .	-3.5378
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were under our guidelines , but the low intake of orders and market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-3.9787
Sales in the aerospace part fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.3971
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector have increased by just 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.1329
The order book in the transport part was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , and was therefore slightly increased compared with 31 December .	-3.2743
The profit margin in the field of transport has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.3186
According to corporate governance , there will be new requirements for the fourth quarter .	-2.5861
In the afternoon trade on Thursday , the Bombardier shares succeeded 8.5 % and stood at $ 4.83 , after announcing that the Google Financial Board will change Patrick Pichette to the Board of Directors .	-5.2655
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardy ’ s closest rival , reported a ten-percent decline in quarterly profits on Thursday .	-3.1982
US Shoots at Los Angeles Airport	-2.0213

Cocain-dependent lawyer , who warned drug boss of police investigation , must enter prison	-2.6982
Basharat Ditta , 42 , provided information to Neil Scarborough Underworld Size	-2.6971
The Lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light .	-2.1900
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court	-1.9065
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be detected was sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.1108
Basharat Ditta , 42 , underworld size Neil Scarborough provided sensitive information about his drug trafficking activities after he was compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-3.5306
The lawyer praised by criminalists as “ first-class ” with the nickname “ Bash ” was arrested in 2011 after the police Scarborough monitored whom he had represented in an earlier drug procedure .	-4.2199
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while it was with colleagues at a food of the lawyer chamber .	-3.6494
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after found in his hair tests , wallet and credit cards .	-21.5492
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.4355
All four suspects were then monitored by the police under a major investigation procedure into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-2.7086
Together with 32 other people they were arrested later , after the police ensured heroin and cocaine in a series of house searches , valued at 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash .	-4.5082
Ditta , 42 , provided information to the criminals because he feared that his drug addiction could become public .	-2.5954
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and condemned at Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstructing the judiciary .	-3.8379
He gave cocaine ownership during an earlier survey .	-3.2895
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that it had confessed regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.8887
Two investigative officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas House and purified the drugs in a black golf glove under the lawyer ’ s rubbish with a purity of 60 % .	-4.1599
Shortly after delivering the drugs , Scarborough regularly phoned Ditta at the football stadium at Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .	-3.2753
The lawyer returned home , the drugs picked up and nine messages were exchanged between the two .	-3.4316
Before court it was known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after having been discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards at tests drugs of class A .	-4.3551
Ditta was later arrested but denied to take cocaine and said that he spoke with the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that her discussion was subject to “ lawyer secret . ”	-4.0299
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were ensured and a hair test was taken from him .	-3.2431
At the police interrogation , he said that , under his private address as well as in the workplace , he would call him at home for legal matters .	-4.7354
Before the Court , it was known that he had called important drug trafficking players , some of whom he had previously represented , for important arrests and informed about what the investigators knew about them .	-4.3086
Prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that one does not break the law . ”	-2.5212
Ditta is charged with the abuse of his position as a criminal defender , because he has entered into very much with certain clients .	-3.9936
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker , but a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-2.5013
Part of his messages was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-2.8635
But this went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-1.8720
He acted as much as possible against police investigations so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities .	-3.6738
Mr Ditta brought his profession to disrepu.	-2.6070
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-1.9291
Ditta made every misbehavior of himself , claiming : “ If I were a corrupt lawyer I am not , and information to Scarborough wanted to pass on , I would not wait for 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-5.4397
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began to acquire drugs of organised criminals . ”	-3.5333
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime , who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-3.9696
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure public confidence and confidence .	-2.0145
Ditta has fallen behind this confidence and tried to get himself behind the facade of his profession .	-4.8564
The Lancashire Serious and Organised Crime Unit chaired the investigations against Ditta , which also led to condemnation in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial disability , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.0761
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that none of the arm of the law can escape .	-9.3606
We will find you and bring you to court .	-2.3701
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after declaring himself guilty of the conspiracy of heroin , cocaine and cannabis trade .	-3.0458
Thirty more people involved in drug trafficking — people were sentenced to penalties of 153 years for drug crimes .	-3.8724
On his website , Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself stating that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and opportunity to motivate his work .	-4.5770
Revolutionary Church Music Work	-1.4101
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary , the song Dunningen will frame two God services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.3671
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which inspired the viewers this spring , the song sick will enrich two God services with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year .	-4.6416
On Saturday 26 October , this extraordinary exhibition will be heard from 19 during the evening exhibition at the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 October , from 10 : 15 at the God Service in the St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf .	-4.6345
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " singing to the celebration of the sacred victim of the exhibition " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of the emergence .	-4.7070
The trade fair is listed within the framework of the God Services , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in min. .	-9.6645
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ .	-3.0906
Haslach : Skepticism is increasingly swifting confidenfor	-11.6906
For example , the 2015 parish community elections will change fundamentally in the Haslach ( SE ) sea care unit .	-3.9971
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-2.4832
In a joint meeting , the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschenstein prepared for change on Saturday .	-2.6689
The fundamental decisions of the diocese are nothing more to change and it is up to the parish communities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-3.4679
In the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism towards the new slowly but increasingly differs from confidence .	-5.1022
From the ideas and expectations of innovations in 2015 to specific proposals on the future composition and the size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Sea Care Team were enough .	-4.7173
Based on a presentation , Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained the newly established guidelines for sea care units in Archdiocese Freiburg .	-3.7474
In future , the SE Haslach as a church community forms a body of public law that enters into the rights and obligations of the six individual church communities .	-4.3245
There will only be a joint parish council and a foundation board in which the priest is represented power .	-4.6333
From each parish , at least two elected members should be represented , in the six parishes , so-called local community teams will be formed .	-4.4839
Their task will in future be to promote church life in the place .	-2.8726
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then showed considerable need for talks .	-3.6863
The innovations provide that accumulated credits are maintained in the parishes for purpose .	-3.9700
The liabilities go against the community as a whole .	-2.5683
There were great concerns precisely with regard to the major planned investments , whose commitment all parishes would then meet .	-4.8034
" Even in the past , only projects that could be handled by the individual parishes were invested , " relativized Haslach 's parish chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-4.3240
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Kitter , the chairman of the body in the South Care Unit Shutterwald Neuried .	-4.5810
They had made themselves a task in 2006 , ' one will , five remain ' , and they had to say that this is not so easy .	-5.5773
The Haslacher Soul Unit forces then answered questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-4.5690
Drawings will be concrete at further meetings and will be adopted at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-12.8115
At the end , Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the sea care unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-3.4322
In Pfullendorf the Energy Current Gets M. .	-5.1363
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-2.3595
As the Managing Director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pfullendorfer family will cost 70 to 90 euros per year .	-4.1217
The increase in the so-called EEC circumstances is from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt hour .	-3.2346
This circulation is re-established each year in October by the four operators of the large electricity tracks .	-4.5316
These include the additional costs incurred during the energy turn , which they can collect through a circulation over the electricity price .	-5.0432
Pfullendorf is the last link in this chain .	-2.3434
The Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher level in its forecasts , as Jörg-Arne Bias reported .	-3.9532
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city plants could inform their customers of the exact price increase next week .	-4.0291
" We go from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , says Bias , with the number rather close to the 2 cent .	-3.8854
Long-term Time Time	-3.9825
Sometimes a traffic light is just not green .	-8.0989
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is defect .	-2.6457
What should we do then - drive at red ?	-3.5346
If a person concerned has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free , he can continue , the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker explains in the magazine " Motorcycle " .	-9.2456
However , the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.5379
Becker advises to stay at least five minutes before the traffic failure is assumed .	-4.1964
However , those who continue the journey despite red lights must be aware that he is fully to blame for an accident caused by it .	-4.7046
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and points to a decision by the Hamm Supreme Court counmakman . araroun!	-10.9853
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic light after about three minutes and had to be responsible for a negligent red light .	-3.5815
After all , the traffic lights were not defective , but did not jump over to green later .	-4.8871
A driving ban was spared because of the particular situation - but not fines .	-4.5004
Council is pleased about solid budgets	-2.9898
Whenever it comes to the budget at local meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-10.9143
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and the administration has not known since 2005 .	-2.9746
The 2012 financial year can also be accomplished in this sense as a full success .	-3.1158
This became clear when the annual accounts were presented for 2012 .	-2.2139
As Andrea Rothmund pointed out , the administrative budget , with around EUR 7.6 million , was higher than planned .	-2.9269
The administrative budget surplus , too , is around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-2.5757
The surplus should above all be due to higher trade tax revenue and the local share of the income tax .	-3.7219
The asset budget was again well above the planned values .	-2.8102
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million earmarked last year , it was EUR 2.5 million .	-2.0188
" This is essentially due to the higher increase in the administrative budget , " says Rothmund .	-3.2422
Since less investment was made in the 2012 financial year than planned , the reserve increase has also been higher .	-3.3648
Overall , the overall reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now .	-2.4646
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-1.7071
" Shake such a work not just from the sleeve , " praised Gerster with a view to the accounts .	-4.2978
He and the municipalities were obviously pleased with the good figures .	-10.3861
It may sound paradoxical , but these very good figures could soon be expensive for citizens .	-2.9026
The good financial situation enabled the community to abandon high leverages in the past .	-3.7105
This , however , has often cut grants from the country according to Gerster .	-3.6275
There are conditions for these grants from various compensatory stocks .	-3.0192
Among other things , the cities and communities that apply for grants must have certain leverages .	-3.7890
" The subject of leverages must be looked at as investments for which we would like to have grants in the years to come , " Gerster announced in this context .	-4.8070
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in the Choir for 60 years	-1.6045
With 60 years as singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the Cäcilia men ’ s singer is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival , in which he was solemnly honored .	-4.6527
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his male song club .	-3.0911
After sixty years , he still enjoys singing with the choir that was probably more than dear .	-6.0592
Wermter was also active in the club , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-15.5176
He received several awards for his commitment and scattering : Jörg Kohr , Pastoral Referent on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince .	-4.7113
His singer colleagues handed him the document of the German Choral Association and a grave interest rate .	-4.6996
In addition to the recognition , the 31st autumn festival celebrated a colorful mixture of different choirs and singing styles with the MGV betra , the songs singer department Baisingen and the local music association , which had maintained around 400 visitors .	-7.0929
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In Wine Paradise " and " Funny , its brothers " .	-3.9914
Their honorary singer , Hubert Wermter , prepared them for honor another small booth - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-9.2401

The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan folk " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " from Antos Gus to foreign countries , while the " impulschor " also used foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jew " were part of their program .	-4.0981
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to domestic films with " What ish der Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Pappert 's " Bierlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical completion .	-11.5953
For the children there was a small by-programme - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a Kasperl theatre and read a few stories that worked the children well at midday .	-4.7793

Kenya ’ s Press Indignates Controversial Media Act	-2.4935
“ We are in a frightening situation , and we must ask ourselves what Parliament discourages from simply abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft legislation to be unconstitutional .	-4.9118
“ The law is draconian and very punishing , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , CEO of the Capital Group , one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites of Kenya .	-2.9225
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.5598
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and to send back to Parliament , ” hhhh.	-13.9645
According to the newspaper The Star , the government , through the new law , “ effectively put the media into a stranglehold , ” whereas The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya writes “ a severe blow , ” calling the draft as “ draconian . ”	-5.4227
The passage of the law is one of a series of measures to strengthen national security in follow-up to the attacks by armed Islamists on the Western Gate Shopping Centre in September .	-3.3815
The Kenyan media attracted the authorities ’ anger because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units sent to the centre allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre .	-4.8353
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to this with the recruitment of two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the subject was withdrawn after the media cry .	-4.6435
Under the new law , media houses can be carried out with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to a million , as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-4.3526
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate ownership of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.0306
According to Daily Nation , “ one penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.2765
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a destructive impact on Kenya ’ s “ lively blogosphere . ”	-2.7990
If they silence the media , politicians could do impunity whatever they want .	-1.8375
“ No one will ever experience it , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist at the nation who calls the Kenyan media a a crucial control factor in public life .	-3.6112
“ Left to politicians themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy and back to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-3.1846
Kenya ’ s legislators have already raised public trouble in the past .	-2.3937

Bad Dürrheim : A Dream Gets True for the FC	-1.9704
At the significance of the city and the football club , the official inauguration ceremony for the artificial grass route , despite the cold weather and the rain , had nothing to do with it .	-5.9167
A more pleasant hour had everyone wanted last Saturday , but Peter did not want to play with him .	-4.4115
So all those who came without a rain screen or could not keep one for some reason .	-4.1318

Mayor Klumpp remembered that recurring weather-related influences in spring and autumn set the original lawn square in such a way that it could not be played .	-3.8054
Already 15 years ago , the first considerations were given to solving the problem when the construction of a third place at the terrain of the football club or at the Salinensee real school .	-4.9631
Both have been rejected .	-1.3743
Six years ago , thoughts were given to the creation of an artificial transport ground , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solut. for example ararchit.	-12.9073
Specific planning was included two years ago , when the FC took over the headline in Erbpacht , promised a cost involvement of EUR 100 000 in the construction of the place , and the country approved EUR 104 000 for funfunding .	-6.1418
In October 2012 , the Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000 , Klumpp summarised .	-3.4096
The construction start of the 68 times 108 metres large artificial grass grounds took place on 4 June .	-4.6403

Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.3456
Like this , there will be no longer any problem at Vienna-Schwechat Airport in the future .	-4.0290
Much of the loudspeaker throughput falls away - noise levels should be reduced so much .	-14.6750
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this innovation .	-2.4822
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , the Vienna Airport follows an international trend in setting throughputs affecting individuals .	-3.8515
For example , the airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already abandoning the noisy calls .	-3.7612
The abolition of these throughputs - on average , sound about 200 personal calls by the speakers on one day - is intended to be more calm at the airport in future .	-5.8598

According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu describes a psychological phenomenon that expresses the feeling that a new situation has already experienced or seen .	-3.5881
In case of visiting the same name café on the opschlag in the city of Kleve in sight of the University of Rhine-Waal , it does not have to stay at the pure Déjà Vu sensation .	-5.2300

UN Poverty Reduction Goals	-1.5835
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced twelve years ago to combat poverty .	-3.3766
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began on the evening in Rio de Janeiro , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ Sustainable Development Goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals expiring in 2015 .	-3.1119
They were included in the final draft document adopted by global leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.3557

Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential figures	-2.7473
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of the state , and the first president of Mozambique , to approve peace calls at a rare public demonstration .	-9.9341
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-2.0504
For fear of the country ’ s future , it has exchanged its business clothing for a T-shirt with the label “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined on Thursday the quantity on the capital ’ s independence place .	-5.2151
For two weeks now , there have been reports on clashes between government forces and Renamo , one of the worst fights since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.3469
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by White ruled Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent gover.	-14.7689
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.7151
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will fall back into a full-blown conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.2578
Much is at stake for the fast-growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas reserves off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could bring investments of more than $ 50 billion in companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the United States .	-4.6667
The ruling Frelimo party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo are blaming each other for tension .	-2.6395
Renamo claims that the government provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province on 17 October , a traditional Renamos stronghold .	-3.2094
The attacks on the former rebels escalated , attacked Renamo bases as government forces , and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , Renamo ’ s spokesman against the Financial Times .	-4.0920
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.0823
President Armando Guebuza has tried to play down concerns about instability .	-1.9672
With regard to AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers itself a “ loser , ” who wants to use “ all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.0939
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.5301
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted , Renamo raised the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.0234
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement .	-2.7889
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations , and to be serious , ” Mazanga said .	-2.8428
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a number of collisions this year .	-2.7400
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who met the heads together , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at the Open University and Mozambique expert .	-4.5754
None of them is well in negotiation and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.5876
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reform , has already said that it will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.7304
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.8255
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to gain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.8452
Renamo ’ s electoral success has shrinked since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections .	-9.6612
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.8423
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.6299
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has made unrest attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important north-south connection .	-3.6084
Most battles took place in Sofala province , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , where Beira is located , using the port , mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-4.4450
In June , Rio suspended the use of the railways for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-2.6430
Mazanga responded reluctantly to the question of whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-2.3292
Renamo wanted “ the international community to warn that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-1.8223
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent abduction wave .	-10.7518
“ People think that the government and the President are responsible for the future of the country , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-2.7417
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.4651
“ No interest Renamo and Frelimo , they just want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-2.6649
Children should receive myths and legends as “ examples of life , ” says an author .	-2.8708
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance of having clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.5678
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of age-oriented works .	-3.6581
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.0245
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-1.9470
He added that , with authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ completely disable ” because , in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ underswelling ” .	-4.7523
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in mind as possible . ”	-3.5908
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to communicate hope .	-2.6681
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.6411
This must be underlying , revealing history and not explaining .	-3.0808
This is the old story of showing rather than telling .	-1.9930
Hansjakob Returns to Freihof	-2.7365
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob retired in Haslach , and his last years were alive in the " Freihof " on Sunday .	-3.6534

He presented style with Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach with the two-spanner and Black Forests .	-11.4616
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-3.4540
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly good to become involved in the role of the sister and gave her enormous life in mimic and gesture .	-3.9061
Between the single scenes , the Mühlenbach farmer chapel played appropriately selected music pieces and thus rounded off the performance .	-4.3882
Haslach ’ s mayor Heinz Winkler then gave himself the honor to award the honorary citizens ’ dignity , who , together with a part of the city council , represented the then incumhibhouse H. H. Hhimhimin hihoo. there a .	-14.9234
Their expectations subsequently made the three-king-singer who caused Hansyakob to exclaim : " Oh how beautiful , there are youth memories of my own three-kings alive " .	-6.9842
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the freehof as well as the stork days children with their loud " outline " .	-4.0478
His criticism of the Church at that time had expressed Hansyakob as much as his concerns about the excesses in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-4.5524
In the hometown , behind his tomb chapel on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-3.5542
" A troubled spirit had finally found its peace and had gone home for ever , " it was said at the end of the scene .	-3.9615
Much applause and many commendable words were from the audience for performance .	-3.1260

" The signals serve security and are required by law " , says Matthias Schrell , Managing Director of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-2.6256

What about the first ?	-1.5373
Does he know about the phone hacking ?	-9.0365
He disputes this , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-2.8424
Rumors about an affair Clarke were first taken up by the NotW feature editorial when a source of sexual interest in Pawlby was said : “ Don ’ t waste your time , it is with Charles . ”	-3.8458
A band with voicemails from her phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaires apartment in August 2006 .	-2.8321

But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 % tax on income of more than a million euros per year , which all companies in the country will pay for two years from 2014 .	-3.5889

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in tragic accident believe in murder	-1.7758

Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on 11 January in a matte situated behind the gallery in the Schulturnhalle .	-3.9663
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , which doubts the 17-year-old family .	-2.8516
“ You are convinced that her son was murdered , ” said Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , towards FoxNews.com. .	-9.0264
They would never believe that he died as the Sheriff concluded .	-2.5751
“ You believe that there is no logic to violate the laws of physics and common sense , ” says Crump .	-3.7285
Rather , they are convinced that the truth is being covered to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-2.6928
“ Her son went to school to learn and came back in the bag , ” he commented .	-3.4489
US Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into death of Johnson , because a number of important issues are unresolved .	-11.8547
What was the cause of death ?	-0.8561
Is his death resulting from a crime ?	-1.6251
The declared Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.6437
I follow the facts in what direction they are taking .	-2.7896
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.3685
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.1873
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsy indicated that Johnson died of the consequences of “ position-related suffocation . ”	-2.8358
A second autopsy , however , resulted in a different cause of death , says Moore .	-2.9724
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-10.7078

CDC Allergy Guidelines for Schools	-1.8603
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies for children in schools .	-2.5539
These are the first such directives that the US Government has issued , as the number of school-required children with food allergies is rising .	-3.0747
One in 20 children in the United States now has food allergy .	-1.6869
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.4426
The guidelines include information for schools , which should raise awareness of food allergies and how to deal with children who show allergic reactions .	-3.9927
It is also recommended that Epinephrin schools stock in stock – the auto injection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – to meet a potentially fatal over-sensitivity reaction .	-3.9930
Legislators in the federal states have recently amended the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin in stoc.	-3.9979
The report also includes a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children who have an allergic response .	-3.6088
Children may say , “ It feels as though something pushes on my tongue , ” My tongue feels like a hair on it , or “ my tongue cribs . ”	-4.0250
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ Gender Undetermined ”	-2.0395
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with unclear genitals .	-2.4626
Newborn babies are no longer assigned rigidly male or female .	-2.4943
Under the new law , parents no longer have to explain gender for such children , but can specify “ indefinitely ” or “ not specified ” on the certificate of birth .	-3.6271
The law aims to pressure parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for gender allocation among newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-4.3385
According to BBC , one intersexual person said later : “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.2314
I remain mutilated and full of scars by doctors .	-3.6889
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year are neither boys nor girls .	-2.7807
They are among the intersexuals , a group falling under the diagnosis of “ sex differentiation ” ( DSD ) , a concept of collection for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( eggs or hods ) or unusually developed genitals .	-4.0973
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.5955
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise to use the best available gender information if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before – if anything – choosing an operation .	-4.2514
The New York psychiatr Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds after a good thing ” .	-3.0722
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.2054
“ Some people have life-threatening illnesses that require surgical intervention , but most children do not , ” he said .	-15.4210
You can assign a gender without an operation and wait for the development of identity .	-3.4196
Scientific data on how a child even develops its gender identity is not very precise .	-2.7256
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.5665
It is like the secret why people are homosexual .	-1.5348
A report to the European Commission of 2011 states that intersexual people are different from transsexual or transgender people , because their status is not gender , but is due to their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically both simultaneously or not clearly defined as one of them .	-4.0482
These properties were shown in sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals , or in chromosoms and hormones .	-3.9568
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in working life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .	-3.2201
Not matching gender image boys now have a special camp .	-3.1331
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to specify male , female or “ third gender ” on official documents .	-2.8675

In neighboring France , gender issues are still controversial , such a news report on France 24 .	-3.0612
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.1407
The US Catholic Online website has also spoken out against German law , justifying “ If the world is being dragged into a new state where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we will distort two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-4.6269
The mother of a newborn from Maryland declared against Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth bab.	-15.1386
“ The parent is stressful enough even without further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your own child , ” she said the parent website .	-4.2180
Children need stability and security .	-0.7400
Historically , children born with both male and female sexes were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes .	-2.9125
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something to be extinguished and then rebuilt .	-2.7657
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , having known how complex gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels with the gender they assign .	-4.8123
“ In the mid-twentieth century , it was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Dresher .	-9.7785
When such a child was born , one called not the psychiatrist , but surgeons .	-2.6871
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genital dates back to Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who argued that gender was formable .	-4.0539
He characterized the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental incentives – such as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , shaping whether a person considered male or female .	-4.4294
But his theories became controversial in a case that became known under the title “ John / Joan ” . a case throththrouwinwinwinwinwiwinthin winter winwinwinwiwinwinwiwiwi	-16.0363
He called upon the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a bottled circumcision to castrate the child completely and also to remove his hands and then to big him as girls .	-5.6993
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion , which he was not , ” says Drescher .	-3.1741
When the boy was about 15 , he changed back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.0842
But he committed suicide at 38 .	-2.4431
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.2360
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the Internet ’ s entry , survivors of these gender operations entered the public , who “ are not happy with the result . ”	-3.5180
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old author from Montana , born with XY male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.8884
The doctors were not clear whether he had a large clitory or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-2.9700
So his external organ and the hodes were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and he was largely brought as girlgirl.	-5.0789
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.5877
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com	-2.0088
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.4070
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-1.8806
But since he was depressive and knew that something was not true , he demanded his medical acts .	-2.9331
What he found out was shocking .	-1.2654
I was sterilized at my birth – none of them ever told me .	-2.4882
Bruce was born with a DSD where his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-2.6653
After experiencing the truth , he switched back to male identity , received Testosteron injections and caused his breasts to be removed . , he hima himhimse. thought a breastfor .	-13.8465
The operation has made it infertile .	-2.1282
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-2.6049
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of the Advocates for Informed Choice legal group based in California , is concerned that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatising . ”	-3.4192
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision could encourage parents to make rapid decisions and allocate “ to the child , ” she explained .	-3.3800
We fear that this will encourage intervention .	-2.4675
We think it would be better to assign male or female gender and then wait .	-1.9408
However , we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-8.7945
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as a third gender . ”	-2.6247
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.4279
The German law is about assigning birth .	-2.4578
This is not a struggle to force small children to compel them at that time .	-4.0473
When they grow up , they can decide for themselves about their bodibodies .	-3.3814
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast tradiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that German law is “ authorised ” both parents and children .	-3.6613
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete andrug resistance .	-2.3727
Due to the receptor defect of the Testosterone target cells , Katie developed female characteristics .	-3.0885
It has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-2.0005
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as an employee in children 's psychiatric sy. .	-15.7977
While it is infertile , it hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-2.8183
“ The law gives parents space whereby they do not have to make decisions topply , ” said Baratz .	-3.7918
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things and gives them time before writing “ male ” or “ female . ”	-3.2543
In this way everything is fine – you draw the child large and love it .	-3.7028
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental luck .	-2.5811
And we do not need to rush out an operation that cannot be reversed .	-3.7570
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents expulse because they believe they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-3.4767
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that fits better – and that is wonderful .	-2.9338
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-1.9748
Unknown injured girls by car shot	-2.4795
Unknown shots from a car injured a twelve year-old in Saxony-Anhalt .	-3.2764
The perpetrators were probably fired on Thursday evening in Genthin with an air pressure weapon on a group of children .	-3.0108
The police informed the castle .	-2.1523
The girl was easily injured on the left wade .	-2.4462
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital .	-1.9752
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-2.5003
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.7990
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .	-1.7800
A disk broke .	-1.6360
They then left .	-2.4884
The criminal police identified it on Friday .	-2.2750
Until now , the Kempten police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-2.5381
Officials were only called twice to job children who threw them against house facades .	-3.6506
Since home owners recognized this in good time and removed the egg remains in the same way , no material damage will have been caused .	-5.4058
Furthermore , some sylvesterböllers were ignited in the town area , but no material damage has been caused here .	-13.3990
A resident in the Bishop Freundorfer path reported that his car was wrapped with clopaper and its wheel blends were designed .	-5.0795
Until the police arrived , however , the man found his cycling blends in the immediate vicinity everyone found themselves , so the police did not need to continue working .	-5.1742
Living with a Future Perspective	-1.3847
Actually Waltraud Ries lives dreamy .	-2.4498
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , an old tree stand , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.4166
It is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-2.6668
" You hopefully have no fear of spiders ? " , asks Waltraud Ries and shows a great spider on the door frame .	-3.8587
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time .	-2.2080
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.8280
The reason , however , is not a spinning phobia , but a concern not to be able to handle at age the many stairs to the house and in the apartment , she explains .	-4.8072
Moreover , since a meniscus operation , the Middle 50s have had to know what it means to move with handicap from floor to floor .	-4.9432
Recently a book of her appeared on the subject of ' happily live at age - What kind of residence is the best for me ? ' .	-4.4909
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not go at all in age ' starts to tell them .	-3.4102
When she moved to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a nice apartment in the middle of the green .	-9.1763
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about this .	-2.4432
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who deal with the issue of ' living in age ' .	-4.0137
Most people are displacing it as long as it is .	-2.9491
Alt always just becomes the other ' , she says smiling .	-3.2158
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great is thought .	-4.0216
'Then it can be too late ' , so Ries .	-2.8748
In her book , the interior architect presents 17 models of living for a self-determined living in age .	-3.5953
'What type of residence you choose is always an individual decision ' , explains it .	-3.3675
D i e solution there is not for age .	-2.3946
Even those who can afford the age rest in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that it can become ill .	-3.0245
And : ' Without good knowledge of the language of the country , you can join forces in the Dolce Vita , ' the author of specialist books will consider settlements .	-6.4037
Their models include classical care models , alternative forms of living or the often quoted retired WG .	-3.5035
At age , everyone has its Ticks and Macks	-2.8209
'For me , however , such a community of residence would be nothing ' , she means with an eye angle .	-3.9250
Even not like a student WG with a shared bath and a kitchen .	-3.3575
'At age , you just need your withdrawal rooms ' , says Ries .	-3.5215
Nevertheless , the author does not want to rule out the fact that a community of senior citizens can still function .	-4.7459
However , this would have to be different from the classical student-WG .	-4.2402
And sometimes you just want his peace , ' she believes .	-3.3137
With this opinion , at least in the capital , it is not alone .	-4.1124
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment ' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil service life at the age of the national capital .	-4.0755
Their services advise people on the issue of ' older ' .	-2.7399
Therefore , elderly people in particular would often also accept inconveniences and restrictions in order to remain in their usual environment , which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-4.8480
There are many ways of making the house or apartment accessible today .	-3.3949
Ries recommends to anyone who deals with the age-friendly reconstruction of their house or home , to first provide information and not to assign the first craftsmen .	-6.8205
Today there are also specialists for the age-friendly reconstruction .	-4.1947
Even in the rental apartment this can be realized one or two , and if it is only the increase in toilets , the interior architecture clarifies .	-5.0455
But it is not always possible to change the existing apartment according to age and thus accessible , even if it is so beautiful .	-4.7927
This experience had to make Waltraud Ries .	-1.5639
Although you could install a stairlift within the apartment , the path paved with stairs to the door would be far greater obstacles .	-4.8548
She will continue searching for the ideal object for her and her husband .	-2.6656
Before moving it , it is greying more than in front of the spider at its doorstep .	-4.8665
America ’ s Want to Prosecute Snowden	-2.3142
The US has not changed its position as former US intelligence staff , Edward Snowden .	-2.5707
He will continue to be accused of disclosing unauthorised secret information .	-3.1641
He therefore needs to face a criminal proceeding in the US , the spokesman of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-3.6892
Recent statements by Snowden would not change that either .	-3.1806
Previously , German Green politicians Hans-Christian Ströbele appealed to the US not to punish him further after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow .	-3.4841
Psaki stressed that Ströbele 's statements were that of a parliamentarian , not that of a German government member .	-3.7379
Intelligence center Edward Snowden is fundamentally ready to talk to German authorities .	-3.1146
However , first he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.2158
The former NSA employees sought by the US made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , Bundestag , and General Prosecutor .	-12.4324
The letter has the following wording :	-2.3028
The Responsible	-1.7733
I have been asked to write to you concerning your investigation into mass surveillance . for this !!	-9.1531
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contractual or direct employment as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .	-3.2655
During my employment in these institutions , I witnessed systematic breaches of my government , which led me to act on a moral basis .	-4.0771
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and persistent hog that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-4.2498
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.5972
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the United States and elsewhere .	-1.8037
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a system of all-embracing surveillance that no one is accountable to anyone as a public service .	-4.1139
These spying revelations brought about many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence .	-14.8410
The benefits for society from these knowledge gained become increasingly clear ; at the same time , the risks involved were clearly reduced .	-3.9757
Although the outcome of my efforts was proven positive , my government still treats dissent as a loyalty and seeks to criminalise and charge political expression .	-3.4388
Nevertheless , the truth is not crime .	-8.9141
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this damaging stance .	-13.2606
I hope that if the difficulties in this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate properly and legally in the responsible information on the issues concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-16.4940
I look forward to a discussion with you in your country once the situation is clarified and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law , which protects us all .	-3.3484

Kindergarten Found a Private Buyer	-1.3323
" The building is in good hands , " says Winterlingen 's Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.8726
The former kindergarten on the Gartenstra<unk>e has sold the municipality to a private individual .	-3.0422

" The municipality is satisfied , " emphasises Maier .	-2.1504
EUR 100 000 were scheduled for budgets .	-12.5407
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-2.3724
The Mayor is right that winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer have to pay for the entertainment of the house , heating , looking for the garden and clearing the walk .	-4.9273

The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , reporting on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had “ extensive group meetings and surveys carried out at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s dwindling hope of re-election looks better when he dropped bbidebb.	-13.5573
According to Jonathan Martin , the National Correspondent of the Times , the book thoroughly draws the history of the efforts of leading employees of the campaign and the White House , namely the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure what effect it has on the polls to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against the Vice-President .	-4.1717
The potential change was a strictly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.7722
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , Obama ’ s former campaign leader , Jim Messina , and White House ’ s previous leading advisers , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the intended change .	-3.7289
In “ Double Down , ” it is claimed that Daley led the effort to exchange bids despite their “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before eventually opposing such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-4.8265
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing bides with Clinton .	-2.2032
“ I expressed a whole series of things to be considered , and that was one of them , ” said Daley to the magazine .	-2.6078
It must be remembered that the President then had terrible poll values , so we thought : “ For God ’ s will , what are we doing ? ”	-3.8642
While Daley called the investigations “ offered care , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that significant effort has been made during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a train is paying out with regard to the ballot boxes .	-4.4930
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups , unless you think seriously about something , ” Martin explained on AC360 .	-3.2476
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about exchange .	-2.4703
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley if his then boss had known about the potential change .	-2.4594
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew .	-3.4415
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political explorations would have reached the desk .	-3.1348
Cooper asked Martin whether he thinks seriously that Obama did not know of the investigations into whether to drop bides in the elections .	-3.6847
“ Possible ” , Martin replied .	-1.8407
What happens on the road with my email ?	-1.9749
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter .	-2.9306
Was the Internet service designed e-mail similar to that of conventional post technically implemented the mail secret ?	-4.8584
When designing early Internet services , the priority was to make communication possible .	-2.8565
Therefore , in the fundamental technical protocols , it has not been taken into account to create a stable foundation for a consumer change of letters . a important factor withwithwithin busibudg.	-19.1116
Therefore a conventional email corresponds to an open postcard rather than a sealed letter .	-2.6930
When user sends " Anna " to " Benni " a mail , are the machines directly connected to the two .	-12.3853
The e-mail program or browser from Anna sends the mail to the mail server of its service provider in the first step .	-3.0006
For example , if you have a GMail account , the Google would be .	-2.1971
This mail server sends the content to the provider used by Benni .	-1.8262
On the track , the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet .	-3.1333
Bennie can then call the content with his provider .	-1.8973
Will conventional emails be read on their way through the network ?	-2.4776
Most mails are read several times by software robots .	-1.9797
The sender provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment .	-3.6041
A virus check is also made on the receiver systems .	-2.1410
Moreover , the providers check whether it is a burdensome and unwanted spam mail that is deleted equally or sorted out into a spam folder .	-4.7490
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.3117
In the case of systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising . .	-10.8952
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trips , Google can display links to holiday offers .	-4.1394
Read unknown people the emails with ?	-2.6698
The probability that unauthorised persons read a mail is extremely small .	-2.6866
In theory , however , this is pos.	-8.3890
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to participate in electronic mail .	-2.4197
Law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal opportunities to intercept or take note of e-mails .	-3.3655
Furthermore , possible illegal spawning actions are .	-4.2048
Is it possible to protect emails against reading ?	-1.6368
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be effectively encrypted against reading .	-2.6204
With high technical effort it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an email communication so that not even without any further detection can be recognized who communicated with whom .	-4.1505
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-1.4141
According to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play a lesser role in the mainly privately used mailboxes .	-3.5430
While the shares of Yahoo mail last fell , GMail could clearly add to Google 's .	-11.4758
Mothers in Forest Rescue and CashiRent	-15.2190
When his mother concerned died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.3820
He grubbed the dead in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and care money .	-2.8423
In order to be able to collect further pensions and care money , a 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother after investigations by the police in the forest .	-3.5583
First he covered the death of the 89 , then he cancelled money for more than one and a half years .	-3.7809
Now , as a speaker said on Friday , the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud .	-2.7829
So the man hided the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.0932
The man was suspected already in May : at that time it emerged that no drugs were needed for the mother in need of care .	-4.2816
The pensioner told the investigator that his mother was travelling to Spain .	-2.0203
Because the officials were strange , they continued to identify this .	-3.7173
It turned out that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and last cared for it .	-4.1031
The 67-year-old finally granted the death of his mother .	-2.4063
Obduction , according to the police , did not provide evidence for capital crime .	-3.6755
Feeling for ice cream shining in the dark ?	-2.6325
A British entrepreneur has developed the first shining ice in the darkness – through quales .	-4.2193
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the seas and created a shining delicacy .	-3.4340
The idea came to him after he had read a research on quals and persuaded Chinese scientists to make the bright protein artificially .	-4.2114
The ice cream responds with the tongue , which raises the pH value in the protein and triggers the luminosity .	-3.6306
Chris explains that the dining is responding to the warmth in the mouth and light – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-3.5385
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious , ” says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.4195
The protein used in the ice cream responds with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.2529
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value and ice shines .	-2.2684
We have tested it in recent months and it seemed ideal for us to put it on the market on Halloween because it has this wonderful luminaire effect .	-3.1669
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever manufactured , because the substance is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.0350
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.5412
But for that it tastes delicious .	-2.1882
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and sheet gold .	-2.6269
But its latest creation is to become even more ambitious .	-1.9447
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-1.8301
This in itself is impossible because of the break of light caused by the ice crystals made up of ice cream , but I suspect we find a wfacility for it to .	-6.2770
The Ice Cream uses the fluorescent properties of a Quale manufactured by Chinese scientists	-3.9990
After six days of play , the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the handball association liga .	-3.6867
For the team of Ingo Ehlers tomorrow we will be celebrating the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.5946
With this game the season begins again for us .	-2.3708
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " Ehler 's behavior is optimistic .	-3.2506
Finally , with the exception of the permanent Hendrik Blohme , he has his complete cader available .	-3.5730
Daverden also relies on tempogame .	-2.7196
We must therefore minimise our error rate .	-2.3017
First and foremost , however , we need to increase the cover , which has left everything far from a safe impression .	-4.4944
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-2.9191
The game was of course a house number .	-1.5994
That is why we are far from favourite , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-3.4302
Nevertheless , Panitz wants to start a series now in Morsum .	-2.6221
Jan Malte will be missing .	-5.9587
For this , the A-youth Joost Windsuss , who is active with double playing at the A-Youth Ligists HC Bremen , celebrates his seasonal debut .	-6.5518
Those who are not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.2189
Halloween 2013 : In Figures	-1.3934
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-1.6028
My sisters and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and wear us for the neighbourhood .	-2.5727
Today I became a Halloween muffle .	-2.1045
Over the last two years , I have not agreed to distribute my apartment from sweets , and I think it will not do so this year either . !	-9.1398
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep in Halloween 's matter .	-2.5353
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , such as the US Association of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-3.3151
One thing I am looking forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-2.5577
The costumes will represent about $ 1.2 billion of the US $ 6.9 billion spent , so the NRF .	-10.7777
This year , invigorating unlived items are the last cry .	-3.8046
Women no longer need to cover themselves in sexy clothing ; they can now also embody tempting food such as pizza , hamburg or carrots .	-12.2071
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft-Punk space men will make it into the instagram feeds this year .	-3.1705
According to Google , the most sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.2394
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.7102
Last year we dressed our dogs and I am surprised not alone .	-3.7454
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , the NRF .	-1.9899
These are a lot of “ Hot Dogs ” .	-2.2376
As far as candy is concerned , we are not exactly .	-3.2419
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , The Nielsen Company .	-1.4533
These are approximately 270 million kilograms of chocolate , loudspeakers , bonbons and rubber bears .	-3.3068
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Department of Trade , who draw through the quarters with the saying “ sweetness or saures . ”	-4.3446
Indeed , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not imagine – eat .	-3.3635
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; yet 15 million kilograms are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of Sweets Manufacturers .	-9.5361
These are about nine billion corn grains .	-1.9437
It is a puzzle that I have not yet been able to resolve .	-2.3214
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it spokes . .	-8.4313
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is in real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-2.9072
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States that achieve $ 500 million revenues , America Haunts , including the wonderful photos on which you are pinkeling and then placing friends on Facebook where you will not get rid of them , and one of the types to which you stand leaves a comment like “ nice facial expression . ”	-6.2447
But we are finally coming to the pumps .	-2.9666
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the great pumpkin when we were children , and the carving of a pumpkin latern is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we made from small to small .	-3.8239
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with carving the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-14.4082
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkins , the US Census Bureau .	-2.2423
The pumpkin laterns , which are slowly rotating in the front garden , are probably Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumps were harvested this year . mmmiffulful. mimixfeful. f	-10.8288
If you want to point correctly , call Tintin and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut some chickens from their 921 kilo of heavy pumpkin .	-3.8486
Helmbrecht housing fire : rescue forces bear charged bodies	-4.1265
The fire brigade had to express itself in Helmbrechts on Thursday evening .	-11.8820
A three-family house in the county of Hof begins on Friday fire during the night .	-3.2006
The rescue forces are a charred body from the house .	-3.2116
Rescue forces found a coaled body in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrecht .	-3.5971
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a spokesman of the police in Bayreuth said .	-2.8312
Late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.7804
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames beat from a window .	-2.2591
The staff went into the apartment and found the corner in one room .	-4.1741
This and another room burned completely .	-3.4512
The whole ground floor has been damaged .	-1.5846
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police speaker continued to explain .	-2.9697
The building is no longer inhabitable .	-3.4085
The exact cause of the fire was initially unclear .	-2.0909
Germany ’ s largest national church has launched an offensive to advertise the Pastor ’ s profession .	-2.8279
Background is a potential shortage of parishes : the Evangelic-Lutheran Church of Hanover expects that the number of its current around 1,800 pastors will halve after the present situation by 2030 .	-5.0429
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) said in conversation with the Evangelic press service .	-3.4873
It is attractive to determine the working and day-to-day process itself .	-3.1740
With Burfien , for the first time , the Landeskirche asked a pastor in a full place to inspire young people for theology studies .	-4.3932
At present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology .	-2.2640
Burfien brings this back to the process of decoration : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.4417
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.7927
I am the Lord of my calendar of appointments and can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-3.7399
Pastors could be very close to humans as a seafarer .	-11.1313
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.0240
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologists would have a safe employer for that .	-3.3510
This is coming to the contrary to today 's young people , who are not just about careers , but about meaningful work .	-4.3784
According to the National Church , which includes three-quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors currently retire per year .	-3.2453
At the same time , about 40 graduates from a theology study begin their vicariat .	-2.8569
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , Emsland or Wendland , it will be difficult to fill jobs in future .	-3.6716
Burfien wants to organize days of study for young people , inviting celebrities who have studied theology .	-10.7284
Theology studies offer a wide range of education .	-2.1401
One can even become a federal President .	-9.7246
Land Rover Rally Series Announced	-0.7513
In the interior there are race seats and six-point belts as well as an open-air system .	-2.9926
The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with support from Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle installation between events .	-3.9536
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.6249
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for voltage and adventure and after a reachable way to world class events .	-3.8813
We are pleased to be able to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format develops new opportunities to experience the various rally disciplines in the UK and abroad and to prepare newcomers for the strapazes and reality of Rally Raid .	-4.3690
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge Cars – that will be an entertaining championship .	-9.9553
Furthermore , the Defender Challenge has a training and test day in February , as well as the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.0397
Fire brigade to save a hundred meters above the ground on a dangerous rock leap in a quarry	-3.8563
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby ran away after a smaller road accident .	-3.2141
Three days later , it was discovered by a walker in a quarry in their miserable situation	-10.4285
Fire-fighters ran off on rock wall and saved the dog from safe death	-4.3690
The fire brigade succeeded in bringing a bitch into safety , which was fixed on a 15 metre high lead in a rock face .	-5.6068
The nine months old cockerspaniel-bitch Ruby run away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days before it was saved from a quarry on Wednesday .	-4.0365
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and thank the firefighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.5254
They sought desperately for their missing bitch and published calls for assistance in social networks when they were in quarry after the small road accident .	-5.1470
Approximately 14 : 15 on Wednesday a walker who carried out his dog , the stranded Ruby at the 15 metre high paragraph in the quarry .	-4.6516
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the place and then went to save Rubys , which was then transported to the upper dog box .	-6.2408
Andy Clayton , specialist of the technical bailout team , said : “ It was in a dangerous situation .	-2.4182
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the ground .	-2.6223
She did not move a muscle during her saving – she was like stiff frozen .	-3.2059
But now it goes well .	-2.2045
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-1.9961
That was a fairly unusual effort .	-2.9131
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible .	-1.1896
Peter Lau , specialist of the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge luck . ”	-2.5716
It was possible that it was very difficult to injure or worse .	-2.5188
Ruby was brought to a veterinary examination , but he did not notice anything but exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.2969
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ To watch the rescue was frightening . ”	-2.7463
I could not believe that she was really up there .	-2.5525
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-1.6893
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too large and collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.6078
Fire-fighters have done great things .	-2.3148
It was really courageous what they did .	-1.5413
We are so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.0281
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that she would shut down , but she remained up . ”	-2.7922
The fire fighters were great .	-1.7843
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.3898
Mick Jagger explained that he never did Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.6192
With an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a background singer to Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” from 2004 .	-3.6883
Perry explained that she did dinner with the altrocker and that “ he had driven me when I was 18 . ”	-4.8675
She added : “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.7196
In a statement , a representative Jaggers , 70 , on Thursday , said that he “ categorically denied that he ever tried to approach Katy Perry . ”	-2.9477
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.5618
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling-Stones tour this year .	-2.1476
Her new album " Prism " landed at the beginning of 1 this week .	-3.2207
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives Scots the choice	-1.6571
A new day , a new horror story about independence .	-2.0910
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.1765
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian wall .	-2.8123
Indeed , the Strathclyde template referred to the possible economic benefits that would bring greater travel freedom in the rest of Europe , but this , expected , did not matter in the headlines .	-4.1628
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules if it is more favourable to them .	-3.0685
Since Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continued failure to observe Brussels would only be a small concession in return for what we really want from the Scots .	-3.9092
So no story .	-7.5781
And one that has come so over the years that it is already a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” -ente belonged to at least 40 years ago .	-4.2957
An interesting point in the constant repetition of this ancient history is lost .	-3.2544
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European pipe ?	-2.4029
Why the London yoke exchange for Brussels , especially now ?	-2.3878
These are the real European news : the big plan to unite Europe after the war has stalled .	-3.2281
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-2.0254
Throughout the EU , parties gaining ground that is anti-EU or want to throw the euro over as a common currency .	-3.8846
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party could gather alternative to Germany – only this year – just under five million votes in the German election in September , thereby effectively distributing the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-4.0813
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.6171
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-1.7180
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the national economy is required by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-3.9178
The euro ’ s crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-2.2531
Instead , the Eurosystem has labelled its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that way .	-3.6047
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself again with a built-in productivity disadvantage to Germany .	-9.2492
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – encouraged by Berlin .	-2.2681
A deeper European productivity problem lies behind the current budget and currency problems .	-2.1653
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared with the United States .	-2.9832
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have seen in Grangemouth .	-2.0722
All world wage fixes do not protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-3.0018
As a result , a revolt is raising , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.8928
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-2.9816
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy and has put Europe on its own economic policy , with the struggling French economy .	-4.0649
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing , anti-EU National Front has just won a decisive re-election , thereby referring to three governing socialists .	-3.6638
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the electoral vote – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing divide would automatically mean benefits for the left .	-3.6967
What does Le Pen do with its new popularity among the white French of the working class ?	-2.7067
It wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.3736
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.5311
That is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will meet to abolish the euro .	-3.0564
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of the ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-2.7418
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.2531
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering in the US .	-9.6347
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone will be in the Atlantic rain .	-2.3389
Where is Scotland left with all this ?	-2.0490
We can decide to be a region of ( in the last consequence ) small England .	-8.2227
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can go where .	-2.9214
I suspect that Scotland could go well in a more easy European association if we keep our own currency .	-3.1793
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.2367
Otherwise , we should consider maintaining Norway equal and economic independence .	-2.8458
The SNP government in Scotland – remarkably – is the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that the Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition had to blame .	-3.6129
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to now opt for independence , just to impose austerity on Berlin and Brussels .	-2.7843
Early Puberty : Growing faster	-2.0575
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white people , as investigations show .	-2.8642
Physical change does not immediately mean puberty	-2.1287

Should a mother be concerned when her daughter grow breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight ?	-9.5240
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Children 's Association this week in Orlando , Florida , the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and a new stan.	-4.0603
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that the puberty now enters quickly , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-4.0000
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hairs and body smell , show earlier in girls .	-4.1802
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of menarchy ( appearance of the first rule bleeding ) in the last 40 years .	-3.8513
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , something less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.9706
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to menarche , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early Puberty in girls : the essential advisor to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-4.1534
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-1.8325
It is controversial , which is indeed the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early reading ” when the breast increase is accompanied by a boost to growth eight years ago .	-4.9066
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a child doctor can monitor closely .	-2.4686
When proceeding faster , tests could be displayed by an endicronologist , so that serious problems such as tumor or cysts can be excluded . without iiiiideniiiidentiiideizii iiii	-13.9624
There are methods of treatment to delay early menstruation and the defense of another result : the premature ageing of bones , which can lead to ultimate growth hampering and thus small body growth among adults .	-4.8141
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are guided by the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .	-16.1988
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.3996
Kaplovitz is reluctant in terms of medicines , but he acknowledges , “ Oppressing puberty can mitigate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings , unlike their pensioners . ”	-4.9224
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.6836
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or about how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplovitz .	-2.9634
“ It was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter received ten days .	-2.2841
Even though there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was not emotionally prepared .	-2.6460
She came frightened and excited from school to home because she was the first in her circle of friends . in her wi.	-4.6822
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.9365
But there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment or sexual messages in the media would be causing .	-3.0713
Young come into puberty similar to girls earlier .	-3.0082
Kaplovitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.4931
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged between six and nine , establishing a connection between body fat and entry into puberty .	-3.4102
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-10.7653
In that country , African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white people .	-2.3069
There are different explanations for this .	-1.2628
Globally , an early puberty seems to be influenced by everything possible , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-2.7572
Another puzzle : although boys grow face and shame hairing earlier , the trend toward a full previous puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .	-4.2827
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the issue .	-1.8890
The emergence of acne and shamhaar is even widespread among babies and infants .	-13.7080
“ We must be careful , as we identify the real beginning of puberty , ” said Dr Lawrence Silverman , a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-2.9040
Parents should not hesitate to consult their children 's doctor on how to talk to their children .	-3.5531
“ This may mean that you have to talk sooner than expected , ” said Kaplowitz .	-3.2659
If you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .	-2.7700
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than thought .	-3.5760
Jumbo manufacturers argue about the breadth of seats in the face of large ordercases .	-10.8478
Between leading aircraft manufacturers there has been a debate about the wide range of seats in the tourist class on long-haul flights , indicating the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.3662
The dispute revolves around the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who seek the most , but this designated space represents the key to the efficiency claims on the latest aircraft in Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-5.7530
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard which requires a width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-13.8708
The debate comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers compete to sell even larger versions of their two-engine long-haul airlines and expect record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-4.2412
How the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial for the economic results specified to deliver the new “ mini-jumbo ” design .	-3.8470
Boeing claims that his modernized “ 777X ” captures 406 people in the tourist class , which are more than 17 inches wide , allowing ten per row .	-5.1322
Airbus explains that the competitive version of the A350 transports 350 people in 18 inches of tourist class seats , with nine per row .	-3.6862
Aircraft giants often share livestock about technical details by advertising in the specialist press .	-3.9651
Now Airbus is appealing to the public before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X , with over 100 orders , is expected to make the race .	-3.2368
Recently , the company presented a display that could be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing a picture of donors where three people sit together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-4.5227
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus Chief of Distribution John Leahy .	-2.5739
Given changes in nutritional habits , people are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-2.8082
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul journeys , and the end of the century the male average American increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to the US Department of Health .	-4.0123
According to US health statistics , the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm .	-2.9562
Airbus says that his rival sticks to a concept of seats from the 1950s , when the average body range of the freshly baptized “ jet set ” was more narrow .	-4.3387
Airbus stated that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 % .	-3.5020
Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus to the seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between tariffs and airlines .	-4.2253
The company also explains that , according to investigations , the experience in the aircraft depends on more than the seat width .	-3.4617
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to succeed , ” explains Kent Craver von Boeing ’ s cabin expert .	-3.6199
They do not want us to dictate to them what they make profitable .	-1.5396
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.3398
Passengers are concerned with greater freedom of elbow , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-4.3176
Behind the debate , a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-4.2395
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the conflict over the new jets .	-2.5500
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat with their latest two-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-2.9510
The statements of Boeing on the results depend partly on the 777X being compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-3.7702
The increased cost per unit is still lower than the currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-3.1761
“ Boeing therefore quetches more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-3.1939
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 777s suggested that many passengers choose the closer arrangement , which could be accompanied by cheaper tariffs .	-3.6987
“ Eighteen customs seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert for cabin institution , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-4.0068
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-2.5550
The world travelling jet sellers even carry bandmass with themselves to measure the institution at the competition .	-5.1498
Even if they price comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compact design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-3.4297
Airbus offers an A350 with ten-seated rows , but has not yet sold it according to its own statement .	-4.7316
Until recently , Airbus emphasised the importance of cabins adaptability and offered broad seats for some jets .	-3.6137
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard will probably be pupped , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-3.7587
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make smoking pleasure	-2.7819
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.9551
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-2.7017
Prior to human testing , further attempts are needed , which may take several years before , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-3.6148
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying to try out all the methods available on the market , but have had to experience that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” says Cornell .	-4.1462
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been changed to include genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-13.1210
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent flow of antibodies .	-2.0944
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving a smoker with no nicotine high .	-2.8648
Vaccinated mice administered nicotine contributed to their normal level of activity in attempwise .	-4.4132
Mouse without vaccination , by contrast , would have taken a “ outbreak , ” explained researchers , a sign that nicotine reached their brain .	-3.6740
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine sheet .	-1.9661
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.2754
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-2.5834
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably far lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.2663
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered for people , if it is quite certain , before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine.	-10.3004
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-2.0806
“ You then know , when they start smoking again , they no longer feel pleased with the nicotine vaccine , and this helps them to put off the habit , ” he explains .	-5.1738
British scientists said that the results are interesting , but warned that further research was needed at the s.	-15.0724
Tripodi Disputes that Obeid has been Influenced	-2.7343
The former minister of the laboratory Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is initiated by the state corruption supervision .	-4.1532
The former NSW minister denies that he had changed the rules on maritime leasing at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden participations in three properties in government-controlled countries .	-4.9756
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into the question of whether Obeid influenced different Ministers of State to extend lease-related contracts at Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café without tendering after their expiry in August 2005 .	-5.2108
Now , because of the accusation , Tripodi has known of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in property after Tripodi ’ s former deputy chef , Lynne Ashpole , had stated accordingly on Thursday .	-5.3672
In many years of discussions that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the leasing treaties . based on businebus buses managa .	-21.7550
The guardians were opposed to this and also wanted longer runtime .	-4.0139
In 2009 , the leasing contracts for Circular Quay , which introduced $ 2.5 million annually to the Obeids , were extended without public tendering .	-3.5751
Tripodi , who was Minister of Port from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally voted in favour of public tenders .	-12.8283
But he disputes having made changes to requests from Obeid , who , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganisation of the government ’ s lease-regulations .	-4.6186
One ICAC telephone record showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had changed to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fisheries authority .	-4.0682
“ Was the subject discussed in these telephone talks the drafting of commercial leasing rules ? ” asked the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi .	-3.9498
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.6188
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-1.7402
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-1.2471
Israeli fighter aircraft attack Syria ’ s Official Sources	-1.7666
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , confirmed a senior government official vis-à-vis Fox News .	-3.0479
The official did not explain what the goal was , but said that it was at least one .	-2.3946
According to Associated Press , the objective was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.7334
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria .	-2.3569
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to “ authenticity testing ”	-2.2347
The government is considering a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas as within the framework of extendeactivities throu.	-4.9816
If the test is introduced , it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to occupy unskilled jobs or as a back door for the train of family and friends to Australia .	-3.7957
Today , a government proposal was published , after the former Labor MEPs , Maxine McKew , condemned the government 's comments on foreign workers , because they could be considered insulting by neighbours Australia .	-4.4471
“ Volume declarations such as foreigners are supposed to backfire – and , Australians first – are a very unpleasant return in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she said today to the Australia India Institute .	-5.6265
Historically , this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region believe in an echo of this historic artifact , that would not surprise me .	-3.8493
The proposal for discussion outlines twelve measures that were once considered by the former Minister of Immigration , Chris Bow. articles relate entirently aroun.	-13.9221
Immigration Secretary , Brendan O 'Connor , who held talks on human smuggling in Sri Lanka yesterday , implemented five of the recommended changes , and the others are still considered .	-3.5405
If the “ authenticity criterion ” is adopted , someone who requests a visa could be checked whether “ the application is real in cases where the applicant is related to the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-4.2943
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , companies that wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally stopped hundreds .	-3.8027
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri-Lank asylum probably died of a heart attack after arriving on the Christmas Island this week .	-3.2372
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man , who came to Australia with him , has been maintained since Wednesday ’ s father ’ s death by an adult cousin , who was also on the boat .	-3.9592
Australian authorities brought the man into the Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .	-1.9143
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.2654
The work of HS2 Ltd proposes to achieve high-speed links between Scotland and the North of England as early as phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.4923
Transport minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.1438
The Scottish Transport Secretary , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-11.2361
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.1058
After Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.0688
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North Gland from 32.7 billion pounds to 42.6 billion pounds .	-2.5083
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for North Gland and Scotland .	-3.7020
This includes the possibility of travel time from three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-2.5857
Baroness Kramer said , “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national network that brings Britain closer to its cities . ”	-2.7589
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.0688
Without it we are facing a capacity crisis in our railway network .	-2.3004
But it is also about the connection between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is being improved thanks to HS2 .	-11.0624
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-1.8096
In the name of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” to be used for Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-3.4324
Brown said : “ Scotland ’ s high-speed rail connection has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , while also providing Scotland ’ s economic power with an argument for rapid rail connections across the UK . ”	-4.3506
We are therefore pleased to work as partners of the British Government and to investigate the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , create advantages for all and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-4.3573
I look forward to examining the inquiry report with the British ministers next year and together to adopt the next steps .	-3.0482
Regulations on electronic aircraft remain in force for the moment in Australia	-2.2716
Australian airline passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones at start and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax regulations on such devices .	-3.4740
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read e-books , see or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases , if they are in “ flight mode . ”	-3.6161
Passengers are already allowed to do this during most of the flight , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-3.3944
However , Australian societies are monitoring the decision to implement which US airlines have to do much work on , does not pursue any immediate planstration to chanlate legiscountries with.	-17.2224
The CASA air traffic control authority also declared that the announcement would be looked at , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply in critical phases of air in Australia .	-4.3095
“ The CASA does not currently have specific rules on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft , ” has been announced .	-4.0806
The issue is subject to provisions that airlines must maintain security at any time and follow passengers the safety instructions given by cabin staff .	-4.3516
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA about extending its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and explains that it is open to change , but they should be initiated by the legislator .	-4.0744
“ We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic equipment by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-3.4950
Qantas said that it would remain in the current rules until further notice .	-9.8462
“ Our current directives stipulate that electronic equipment must not be used when starting and landing , and we do not currently have plans to change that , ” the company declared .	-3.7349
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.6775
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and we will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.5230
The decision affects US societies differently depending on the age of the fleet .	-2.9189
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate radio disorders through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instructions .	-3.2593
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at any height , ” the FAA announced .	-10.8843
In rare cases of poor view , the crew will tell passengers while the landing switches off the devices .	-4.1346
The group also recommended that heavier devices start and landing safely steal below seat or in subjects above seats .	-3.9642
Before the Schalke Revierderby , most trailed BVB trailers had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins arena .	-11.5705
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences .	-1.6879
Before the Friday game of the Football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart , the Ultras responded with a silence - first of .	-11.6099
It was an unusual , almost spectacular acoustics that offered the viewer until shortly before the attack of the Federal Liga Game between the German Vicemeister Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park .	-4.1842
Listen mostly to the guest fans with their songs .	-3.7817
The southern gallery , where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand , first presented themselves extraordinarily quiet : no songs , no battle cries .	-4.6692
The podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the shared fire , remained unoccupied .	-3.3632
And in the front of the gallery together a large flag blowing inscription " section stadium ban " .	-4.9270
Only as the goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player entered the place , burned up short-term cheerful . enjowibility ! ! ! ... ! ! !!!	-10.5279
When his team colleagues followed , there were noisy vocals and scarves - but not everywhere .	-3.3004
There was nothing raining in the central blocks 12 and 13 of the southern gallery .	-3.0115
Also that stadium spokesman Norbert Dickel once again listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , extension of trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebrations .	-8.2758
Only five minutes before the attack , the Capo clogged its podium - and the tension that had already been tangible with hands emerged in a loud cry when thickel as usual asked the atmosphere on the ranks in the stadium .	-6.9516
As always the southern gallery was in the row - and finally here again , as usual , was the loudest place in the stadium .	-4.7015
And at the latest when Anpfiff from the southern gallery came to the loud invitation " Derbysieger stands up " , everything was again as always .	-5.1803
Previously silence was a response to what has happened in recent days .	-2.8311
Immediately before the Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the most travelling BVB trailers had fired lightrackets into the spectators and on the square - almost met goalkeepers Roman Weidenfeller .	-6.1597
The game was delayed because of the chaotic scenes .	-1.6693
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the tips of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and believes Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable date for fans representatives .	-4.0214
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.8468
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited Ultras from playing home against the VfB Stuttgart .	-3.2059
" I have prohibited " , he explained .	-2.8233
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnology .	-1.8834
Furthermore , Ultras have shown various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one .	-4.1899
Otherwise , the BVB will set a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.6868
" This will be drastic " , insured coats .	-3.5577
You can be interested in how the reactions in the southern gallery will be .	-4.0885
Pfandhouses boom in Singapore , as the middle class crisis has arrived .	-15.7542
In a Pfandhaus in the Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armreif , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay their daughters ’ school fees .	-3.7225
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is my whole money there , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.0686
Although they earn 3,000 Singapore dollars each month ( about EUR 1,730 ) as an administrator and their husband also work , monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-4.2393
Indeed , demand in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that this week ValueMax , where she made her exchange , became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-3.8305
Jewelry pledges are not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-12.7788
Typically , deposit houses in Singapore demand an effective annual interest rate of 17 percent , which is just above the 15.4 percent required by United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-3.8670
But deposit houses offer the advantage that no review of credit ratings or evidence of income is required here , so loans can be faster than banks .	-4.6891
For this reason , millions of people in the region turn to deposit houses after families feel pressure from rising costs of living and increasing fiscal and consumer debt .	-4.0067
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap loans , owing to easy fiscal policies in the developed economies , families with lower and middle-income incomes are looking for deposit houses to offset the difference in the economy ’ s frustrburbu.	-13.9975
This week , the rating agency called Standard & Poor 's growing fiscal debt , mainly through rising mortgages , a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-11.3672
Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore , according to the Agency ’ s assessment , have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-13.6221
Malaysia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of GDP , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-2.6159
Economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which has come out of a technical recession this week .	-2.9090
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing existing weakness of export and a decline in consumer demand .	-3.1835
“ In effect , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to complement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.2093
Historic highs in gold prices over the last two years have intensified the trend toward pledging personal objects , as people take the opportunity to turn the family ’ s jewelry into cash .	-9.8633
In Singapore , about 70 percent of the pledged items are in the 200 deposits of the city of Gold .	-3.6909
People say , “ The gold price looks good , let us pledge Grandmother ’ s gold chain and bring back next month . ”	-2.9861
The largest Thai Pfandhaus operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % increase in customers in recent months .	-3.1517
Growth in deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , operators of the Bendemeer branches , and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only into neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , says Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-9.5630
The company financed this at 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars it took with the Singapore stock exchange this week .	-4.0930
While some lenders were into the crusade because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that Pfandhäuser would not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also raised debt directly .	-4.8772
“ Customers borrow objects they already possess , and the liquefier of personal values does not increase household training , ” she explains .	-3.7997
The deposit bond business is increasingly accepted as short-term , secured financing .	-2.6565
Nor are all people who use bonds in financial difficulties .	-2.3942

Rescue package over $ 325 million for Tasmanian health care	-11.5866
The Australian Government insists on the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of more than $ 325 million for Tasman ’ s health services to ensure that the government of the state cannot waste the money .	-3.6527
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate measures ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.0713
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasman MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-2.9058
“ The government has drawn up an emergency rescue package that we believe to be addressing the unique challenges facing the state , ” Pliberseck today declared .	-4.2138
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency support for electoral services .	-2.3736
Additional 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for gray star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-3.2899
Moreover , there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better care for stationary residents , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-10.4691
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that clinic staff affected me have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” Tanya Plibersek said .	-3.6101
The Minister insisted on the strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman Government .	-2.3967
The state must maintain the current level of financing to receive money from the Commonwealth , and monthly report on where the extra money has been spent .	-3.9108
A three-headed Commission will be set up to ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-2.8500
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be little benefit if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that bring the Tasmanian public health system to a more sustainable course . ”	-3.5787
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent aid , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.2887
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state ’ s public health system off the list of concerns , ” said Wilkie .	-3.0758
According to the government of the state , these electoral services will largely compete with recent cuts .	-2.9409
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ paving solution . ”	-13.3843
“ We are in today ’ s position because the Labor government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-2.6813
It is unacceptable for a government to leave almost half a billion dollars out of the system , and for the Commonwealth to put 300 million into it and then pretend that good news is .	-13.0791
Dutton asked Pliberseck to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.4786

Syria has destroyed its ability to produce chemical weapons , such as a monitoring group	-2.0419
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas munitions manufacturing facilities , declared the global chemical weapons surveillance group on Thursday , while in the north of the country there were severe clashes near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances were stored .	-4.4308
A Syrian activist group also announced on Thursday that more than 120,000 people have been killed soon since the civil war began .	-2.9596
The announcement of the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the date	-2.7845
1 November , which the Damascus organization based in The Hague had set to destroy all facilities for the production of chemical weapons or make “ inoperable ” , including all machines for mixing chemicals to poison gas and filling ammunition .	-4.3118
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-2.9803
Destroying facilities means that Syria cannot produce new chemical weapons .	-2.0521
But Damascus must start destroying the existing weapons and stocks .	-2.6921
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senfgas and nervengas sarin .	-2.1279
The announcement came at a time when there were struggles in the city of Safira on Thursday , experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage sites , as the Syrian Monitoring Centre for Human Rights , based in the United Kingdom .	-3.9904
The group of activists persecuting the number of deaths via a network of activists in Syria declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-3.0837
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children , are 61,. of thepeoppeoppeop.	-12.8736
On the side of the government , 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-2.9169
Also among the dead were 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.3994
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of dead in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.1283
This number has not been updated so far .	-1.8082
The conflict has forced about two million people to escape the country .	-1.7172
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting against the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of which have links with al-Qaeda groups .	-2.6338
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not call any details .	-2.9185
The struggles underline the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the period in the midst of a daughter civil war .	-4.0355
According to the OPCW , which is closely cooperating with the United Nations , the team is “ convinced that it has seen all the important production and filling facilities mentioned by Syria and seen their destruction . ”	-4.2750
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ” ‘	-9.4927
Earlier this week , the inspectors declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.3114
Because of security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .	-2.7389
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites were “ abandoned ... and the objects of the chemical weapons programme were relocated to other institutions that were inspected . ”	-4.1431
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.1078
Syria has submitted a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved by the OPWC ’ s executive committee next month .	-11.1884
“ I take care of the bravery and courage that you have all shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization , in a comment published by OPCW .	-4.5149

With regard to further developments , the head of the observation group , Rami Abdurrahman , said that there was a strong explosion on Wednesday in an air defence institution in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-3.2037

Anger on Bali ’ s Bombers	-3.3462
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 during the Bali bomb attack were annoyed by the judgment for the last instigators who were brought to justice , since Umar Patek was supposed to be shot steadily .	-5.9487
Patek , who had fled almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people in South-East Asia , was sentenced yesterday for his role in building explosive bombs for a 20-year sentence .	-4.3233
It could be dismissed with penalties after 15 years .	-2.8752
The 45-year-old was found guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.1407
A debt was also made in a number of terrorism-related indictments , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia in 2000 .	-3.4328
The Public Prosecutor had called for a lifelong prison sentence , even though it could have applied for the man who , because of his reputation , is also known as the “ Demolition Man ” .	-5.1526
The decision raised painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago .	-4.0413
Fighting with tears , she said that patek should have been condemned to death .	-2.7310
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-2.6774
“ You should put him in a shooting command , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-3.0672

He fell into coma and “ died ” three times after the attack for a month , while hitting a life conservation system .	-3.6744
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terror cell Yemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and were executed four years ago .	-8.2968
In reality , this type should be given the death penalty above all .	-2.8989
Letting him live – no , there is no reason to let him live .	-2.9018
Twenty years after he killed 202 people and injured many hundreds , is not much . !	-6.7748
Patek is the last Bali bomber in court .	-2.1865
He deprived himself almost a decade of arrest , but was finally taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011 , where US forces killed the former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden almost four months later .	-4.0639
During the negotiation , a FBI agent said that intelligence reports would have indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.3216
“ He did not face up to himself , ” said Corteen .	-1.9688
Until recently , he showed no repentance for how much suffering he caused to other people .	-3.3725
The judgment was made this year before the ten-year anniversary of the attack celebrated in Bali and Australia .	-3.1768
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.3461
Patek can still appeal against his verdict .	-12.0714
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not carry mobile phone calls )	-3.4872
From departure to landing , air travellers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , working , gaming , music , and using the prestige of films , but do not phone the new guidelines published in the US on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) .	-5.1903
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.3658
How quickly they would be implemented depending on the airline , FAA staff Michael Huerta declared at a press conference .	-2.6699
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of aircraft staff and the rules for storing the devices in accordance with the new regulations .	-4.5655
The FAA explained that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.6675
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines .	-1.6951
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the extended use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced in a notice .	-3.2597
Currently , passengers must disable smartphones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-2.9943
They can only start again if the aircraft has reached a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-3.2271
When entering the country , passengers must turn off and not restart them before the aircraft has landed .	-3.9287
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft were safe from electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the devices even when starting , landing and rolling , the FAA explained .	-4.5702
Most of the new traffic aircraft and other aircraft converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.9349
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Association of Professional Airlines , welcomched the amendmen. ! !	-8.9882
“ If the new regulation is certainly implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented Glading .	-3.0936
Frankly , we are sorry to have to feel like a watchword on this issue .	-3.9546
Nevertheless , Internet connections to surf , exchange of e-mails , text messages , or download data from three kilometres remained banned , the authority explained .	-3.7458
Passengers are asked to put smartphones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .	-2.4226
So still not a “ Words With Friends , ” the Scrabble online game that played the actor Alec Baldwin in 2011 on his smartphone , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public effect because he refused to switch off the device while the aircraft was parked at the flight .	-5.1491
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stamped , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-3.0607
Mobile phone calls during the flight are also prohibited .	-3.0661
Regulatory competence for telephone calls is the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not the FAA .	-2.5885
FAA may ban certain electronic devices at start and landing .	-2.9024
Last month , Mark Rosenker said by the National Transportation Safety Board , National Transportation Safety Board , Security Experts for National Transport on CBS News , mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-3.8616
“ Mobile phones are really a problem not only because they could cause disturbances in navigation equipment , but because we know from the FCC that air transmission can also disrupt transmission masts , ” said Rosenker .	-4.3873
A consulting committee of the industry , which was launched by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic equipment .	-3.8071
In recent years , the pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on the use .	-2.5263
Critics like the democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri take the view that there are no valid security reasons for the ban .	-2.8421
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the devices has become ever-present .	-3.4965
In some studies , it talks about forgetting or ignoring up to one-third of passengers switching off the device .	-3.6641
In 1966 , the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers , after reports on disruptions of navigation and communication equipment by passengers carried out by UK radios representing the latest technical trend .	-5.1376
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also so constructed and authorised by the FAA that they do not make anything out of elecelecelectron.	-9.8517
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the airport is reached .	-3.1659
The airlines adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences .	-2.8081
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment under the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.7608
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally less radiation than previous generations .	-2.7683
E-readers , for example , only provide minimal radiation when you change .	-3.9865
But when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.0892
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of relaxing the limitations on passenger device use by .	-4.8015
In 2011 , company employees lost a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not detect them .	-3.8077
Members of the FAA Consulting Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.2031
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the disorder was real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.6241
Other committee members said that there are only single reports of pilots who speak for the disruption of aircraft systems through the devices , and most of them are very old .	-4.2017
The FAA committee , however , recommended that pilots be allowed to arrange passengers ' shutdown in instrument landing under poor visibility .	-5.0115
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers , who are now equipped with technology .	-13.5408
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-8.2365
Bird saved from North Sea Bohrinsel Air Service	-3.6362
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , which had been exhausted on a North Sea drill , was released to nature .	-4.3767
The water rall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was piled by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA in its rescue center in Alloa .	-3.5204
Colin Seddon , head of the centre , said : “ This water-rally was probably a winter bird from northern Europe , which was stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-4.1493
Apparently , the exhausted bird searched for refuge on the drilling islasid.	-4.2237
He added : “ He could no longer fly , so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-2.8546
When they were released , the water rall was back fit and healthy .	-3.2604
Is Europe ’ s elite prepared to do business with Britain ?	-7.1821
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and define what those who provide prosperity and work in the UK want to change our relations with the EU .	-3.5314
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-2.9856
YouGov questioned over 1,000 managers from the economy , who represent about British business sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.0297
The results of the poll will surprise many .	-1.9141
We have found that the overwhelming majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while stagnating in the EU .	-3.3909
They want new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil from the government , rather than stopping with the long and demanding process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-3.8823
When asked about certain legally regulated issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of the economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be recovered from Westminster .	-4.2955
There was general dissatisfaction about the internal market , because , according to the companies , the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the advantages of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed that most traditionally are pro-European .	-4.7906
Finally , and this probably says the most , our survey by economic leaders showed that a significant majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade not on policy .	-4.4875
This knowledge of companies of all sizes and leading groups shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the book of action back to Britain .	-4.7653
It is a matter of much – changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would result in a referendum of 16 % in favour of remaining in the EU .	-3.9439
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan for renegotiating British conditions for EU membership .	-2.6251
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power back to Britain from a renegotiation .	-3.0699
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.4454
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means increased attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approfor rry . businebuves businefeburbusibusinewithbudgfulwing bufewithful	-17.6612
Alexei Miller von Gazprom calls the Bulgarian pipeline the beginning of a new gas era	-2.6019
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects , the Gazprom Board declared .	-2.8941
“ The event today is a milestone : the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.3821
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.8673
South Stream is supposed to ensure more diversity in Russia ’ s export routes throughout Europe .	-2.8688
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , provides an increased risk in conventional routes , as is official to hear .	-3.9430
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ forever . ”	-2.8683
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at favourable rates when the entire project is in operation in 2015 .	-3.1608
According to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries should begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-2.5740

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff charged with accusations against Jonathan Lord for sex offences	-2.5134
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were accused of sex offences relating to children before 2011 charges against the childcare carers Jonathan Lord from Caringbah were raised , as the Royal Commission for the sexual abuse of children learned .	-4.6146
However , in the opening statement before the Commission , the YMCA stated that ‘ it never had to deal with an incident of sexual abuse of children ’ in the organisation . there was no minimumwidth there . for exam, there was no ! there was a !	-15.7416
Phillip Hare was questioned about a case where a YMCA employee had been charged with child pornography for offences , and another where a sporting teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 had been sentenced for the abuse of entrusted children .	-5.0406
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission ’ s assistant lawyers , that he knew of the first case , but did not know the second .	-2.8391
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening statement towards the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that “ external reviews of the YMCA were recognised as the front line for child safety . ”	-4.9742
Instead , evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest evaluation of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Education Ministry ) in August of this year .	-3.1101
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the management failed “ from me to down ” when Lord setting up , and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety directives .	-5.0195
Lord was sentenced to twelve boys during his two-year activities for the YMCA at the beginning of the year for sexual offences .	-3.7400
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.5778
Hare disputes , however , that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord 's infringements regarding the safety of children .	-3.4740
The employees said they had observed violations , among other things that Lord had been alone with children , maintaining them privately as babysitters , sitting on his lap , to one said that he loved it , and that children played with his mobile . ffpefpeoppeopbupeopbus .	-12.9019
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord was asking for a child protection training because it was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service provider Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior of Lords in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time very inappropriate . ”	-4.8574
The Managing Director said that he would not accept statements by employees that they would not have dared to refund their superior me.	-3.8742
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord hampered their judgment , which is why they would not have reported it .	-3.7055
Hare explained that he told the YMCA NSW Executive Board that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” concerns “ not the reporting ” by employees , and the Board agreed to it .	-4.8719
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations occur was made by the managing director of the YMCA child services , Liam Whitley .	-3.3032
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence , which has been “ excessively ” and badly implemented .	-3.6026
The YMCA NSW was not a secure organisation for children , when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , declared Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert on sexual abuse of children , the Commission .	-3.4131
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , review , editing , training and supervision of employees .	-3.7878

On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this happens , in other words ... ”	-3.9004

The knirps , which is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago took its first steps , and his Shetland-Pony Toffee travelled loosely through the three rounds and took the first prize – with 30 adult opponents behind them .	-5.2765
The individual couple , both equal to the same , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-4.2861
When he appeared in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had set his plate cap in a real angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-4.9146
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which lay far beyond his age .	-3.3101
And Toffee received notes for his appearance and personality .	-2.5175
Fenton had received Toffee last March as a gift to his third birthday and since practicing with the Shetland Pony every day .	-4.3831
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great spell . ”	-1.6412
They had to compete against the entire field of participation and went from the place with gold pocal and rosette .	-4.0019
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with tops , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.0849
Totally strangers in the arena considered it so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with it .	-13.3662
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his aunt Sharon Howells , who has been showing horses for over ten years .	-3.6662
Howell told : “ The whole audience was how electrified and everyone fired it and fired it . ”	-4.1580
He ran the entire length of the arena on sand and although he looked so tiny he did fantastic work .	-3.1873
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of .	-2.7495
As he started , it will not take long until he is on the “ horse of the year ” show – and I am sure he will cut well .	-3.4788
A spokesman of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.5061
Together they are a great team .	-1.2219
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the presentation ring .	-3.4246
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and leader – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-3.1434
I am sure that Fentons ’ sweet clothing has contributed its part to matching this really perfectly .	-4.3675
Chinese Newspaper Should Reform	-3.3918
A Chinese newspaper calling on the front page for the release of a reporter accused of defamation should be reformed explained a press regulator .	-3.8552
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.4443
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to counter reports of a partial company .	-3.3493
Now the new express is being subject to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-2.9524
The “ Rectification Order ” came from the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and TV in Guangdong .	-2.9483
Preliminary investigations showed that the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several incorrect reports on the Zoomlion listed company between September 2012 and August 2013 .	-2.9327
“ The editorial management of the Neue Express was disordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a st.	-3.3968
She said it was decided to “ impose an administrative punishment for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his report license . ”	-3.3777
Moreover , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been dependent on making full rectification of the New Express and recommending that the relevant people responsible for the New Express be assessed and immediately reviewed the New Express leadership team . ”	-4.7707
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities by a manufacturer of construction machines called zoomlion madzoomm. mmmmmmmmmm	-9.8475
After he had been arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and put his journalistic work behind .	-2.8821
But then Chen appeared on public television and accepted that he published false reports against payment .	-4.0296
“ In this case , I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the government news station CCTV .	-3.5517
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-1.9945
It has become clear to me that I have acted wrongly .	-2.2479
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page and explained that it failed to properly review the reports .	-3.2033
Various known suspects have recently confessed on television .	-2.2635
Experts say that confessions are still being routinely forced , despite a change in legislation at the beginning of the year , in which the authorities were banned from forcing someone to accuse himself . for this reasof the wishes of the agenda againagain .	-11.7822
Drug Tunnel with US-Mexico Railway	-13.3641
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug trafficking between the US and Mexico , which was fully equipped with lighting , ventilation and electric railway operation , has now been discovered .	-3.1629
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .	-2.2520
The tunnel , which runs in the Zickzackpattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.3189
There are countless inappropriate warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide trucks with drugs .	-3.2844
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized , the authorities declared .	-12.3027
When discovering the tunnel , eight-and-a-half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were ensured , the court records .	-3.8967
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as a driver , were charged with the property and the intended sale of Marijuana and Cocain .	-3.8059
They threaten prison sentences between ten years and lifelong when they blblame .	-4.0430
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dismantling channels .	-3.1151
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered since 2006 in San Diego .	-1.9194
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered after the Marijuana harvest in Central Mexico in October , which presents the drug cartel with the challenge of bringing its product to consumers quickly .	-10.0106
In 2010 , authorities found a nearly 640 metres long passage with rails that led from a kitchen in a house in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-4.0689
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love	-1.2788
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-1.8350
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-1.9888
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year flynn .	-1.3995
Actor Orlando Bloom has spoken about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.2420
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not go as we plan or hope " .	-3.2145
Kerr and he still loved himself , stressed the 36-year-old .	-1.7124
" We will support each other and love as parents of Flynn " .	-2.1532
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their sons were born Flynn .	-2.0450
Veganism , according to Lexica , is subject to vegetarianism , but is very different from that .	-3.0867
After all , while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream , ice or a powerful edam , these mistakes are not on the menu of a vegan .	-4.8545
Milk , cheese , egg , besides the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan leaves off from all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied .	-3.9652
What is left to be asked , but if you look at it , the vegan food world is characterised by a considerable wealth of incidents .	-5.8734
" Bread paints are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , which offers a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.0014
Reuben Proctor also like to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-2.8380
For 13 years , the born New Zealand has lived vegan , in Lampertheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I died and became vegetarians " .	-4.3131
At the turn of the century , the next step took place and I became Veganer .	-12.5413
" The conviction came not only because of food but because of the shoe choice , " says Proctor , who prefers leather normal leather .	-3.8515
He recognized that in other everyday concerns without animal products , too .	-3.1184
First and foremost , vegan is an ethics .	-1.8844
" I do not want animals to die for me , " Proctor expresses the maxim of vegans , which covers all consumer behaviour .	-3.6113
Instead of mourning burgers , stirring eggs or rubbers , the vegan quickly discovered new products that increased enthusiasm .	-3.2340
" It is a double bonus , " says Proctor today , " in fact vegan is not a waiver , no ascese is an enrichment , but it is an enrichment , " assuming that you reduce the selection of menus options , Proctor returns to the power of habit .	-6.4170
And precisely these conditions also left some very well-intentioned attempts to fail .	-4.2524
" The addiction factor is a crucial factor that leaves many quickly abandoning , similar to smoking , " Proctor sets a comparison .	-4.0432
And uses : " Certain tastes are not captured by animals " .	-4.7122
Often it is the spices or type of preparation that make up the taste .	-2.5031
" You can also create the same effect in another way , " shows the vegan .	-3.3098
For example , Proctor brings upper gins , champignons and also some vegan sausages with it . !!! !	-12.7327
It pays attention to a balanced , varied nutrition , where it should taste even smoothly .	-6.1166
Of course , one wants to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.5264
" It should taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food , " says Proctor .	-2.7597
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , has not suffered .	-2.5972
For me , the change had a positive aspect .	-2.1759
I do not take up a foreign cholesterol and have an increased vitamin share .	-2.9016
There are high-performance athletes that feed exclusively vegan .	-2.2016
" My blood values are best , I often let me check " , betrays Proctor .	-3.0149
In particular , many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-2.6245
" Since animals are fed with feed instead of grass on pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cooling pet , the vitamin B12 share is high " , Proctor finds .	-5.0913
For vegans , there is also the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.2302
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-2.0553
Many ways must not go proctor for food procurement .	-3.2585
There are basic foods everywhere and every supermarket now has soyamilk and other products .	-3.0576
I find everything I need on the ground .	-1.4313
Just from time to time I buy something special .	-2.0922
" Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive , but that is how it is known for " ordinary " finished products .	-3.9716
In any case , the preparation of vegan courts is much cheaper and less time-consuming than commonly assumed .	-3.7961
" In the house kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small tips you can get good , if not partially better results , " says Proctor .	-4.6903
Margarine instead of butter , a little more backpowder and carbon acid instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cake , Proctor could also bring his swing parents to the dust .	-5.2120
Family festivals give the vegan a new spices .	-2.6229
That has a new importance when you cook together .	-3.6016
" The situations that may arise are as different as people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.4048
Of course , however , he has already been scepticfor him . ! !	-9.7453
Do not taste my food any more ?	-2.2613
" Should I feel bad now , because I drink milk ? " - on such questions you have to act as a vegan with a sense of fingertips .	-10.2265
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to be an enclave date .	-3.1522
And , more precisely , everyday life does not seem as vegan foreign as it suspects - and the vegan does not restrict itself in everyday life as usual .	-5.7091
Fast Food is also permitted .	-8.3207
Pommes are there everywhere !	-2.1883
" Many donors offer Falafel , or just a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-2.7647
In a pizzeria it differs from pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , everything a question of habit .	-3.0645
The restaurants are so slow to suit themselves .	-3.6546
" When I started to feed vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult , " the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , draw attention to it " .	-3.9567
" When sufficient demands come , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , " he hopes .	-3.2084
Vegane restaurants develop , such as the combination of Mannheim or the Café Vogelfree .	-4.2043
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least a vegan menu .	-3.1751
Vegan dishes are basically there for everyone .	-2.6057
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.0791
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " Proctor notes .	-12.9672
" If we want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way to make most of the first part impossible , " says Proctor .	-3.3130
However , purchasing vegan products could be somewhat difficult at the beginning .	-9.2716
In particular , if you learn to understand that animal additives can also be contained in grounds as colors , you seem to be leaving the courage quickly by following ethics with so many hurdles and traps .	-5.4288
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are used for food and cleaning .	-3.2891
" After and after all you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to respect " It is sometimes better to do than staying or stumbling " , Proctor knows .	-5.1450
Veganism , it is an important moral fingerpoint that beats awareness .	-2.5431
Perhaps he is not entirely successful in dismissing his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically question his habits .	-3.8391
The stock exchange operator Nasdaq OMX keeps his customers in breath .	-2.2936
The trade in the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon .	-9.8637
In a communication , the operator made technical problems responsible .	-2.0307
The other eleven US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-1.8792
The latest incident continues a whole range of smaller and larger bans with the stock market operator .	-9.3740
Only on Tuesday , the Nasdaq indexes were not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport .	-3.0003
In August this year alone , there were two mistakes .	-2.9023
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs sent mass flawed purchase orders to the option markets because of technical problems .	-3.5481
As a result , stock exchange operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders .	-3.4560
Two days later , half of all stock trading in the US came to a halt due to a computer break on the Nasdaq Stock Exchange for several hours .	-3.7514
Furthermore , the stock exchange provided by Facebook last year .	-3.8368
The Nasdaq systems failed to grow the flood of purchase and sales orders , later detected the SEC stock exchange regulatory system and donated the company to a record punishment of $ 10 million .	-4.9194
Constance : Cyclists transfer 63 years of age	-2.9101
The accident happened according to the police , when a 26-year-old man on Thursday night , against 22 o 'clock , was unregularly on the left side of the railway station to the market place .	-5.8015
Suddenly , when a 63-year-old man came to the walk from a local , the cyclist could no longer brake on time , according to the police .	-5.6374
At the following clash , pedestrians were pressed against the house wall , went on to ground and attracted a 15-centimetre long wound on their head .	-5.8145

British police force Makes Assange an Extradition Decre. ! ! !! !! ! ! ! ! ! !	-10.9863
Today , the British police handed over an extradition to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and applied for asylum .	-3.6344
Scotland Yard explained that the 40-year-old Australian had been “ called upon to face up ” to appear in a police guard , and added , if he does not comply , he threatens to arrest him .	-5.8571
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden for the indictment in a sex offence , having exploited its possibilities under British law , since the Supreme Court rejected its objection to extradition earlier this month .	-4.1065
Since he fears that Stockholm will extradite him to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.3963
Scotland Yard delivered “ a 40-year-old man an an invitation to place himself at a time when we chose a police guard , ” said a speaker .	-4.6313
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on deposit .	-1.9124
The message did not comment on the delivery of police requests .	-2.9158
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States , accused of possible spying charges after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks revelation site .	-4.4371
Drivers with 210 km / h and hot drink between legs receive 1,000 <unk> penalty	-3.2054

Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped at Braintree on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz .	-2.5006
After stopping the police , they discovered the beverage between his legs .	-2.8766
Before the Colchester Court of Office , Howie was guilty of being careful and attentive .	-4.1088
It received seven points and a six-month driving ban .	-2.0104
How was also sentenced to pay costs equal to 90 <unk> and a 100 <unk> surcharge .	-4.0494
Foreign real estate owners tax on London ’ s Speculative Bubble	-2.2188
The Treasury has temporarily calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor George Osborne , Chancellor of the Treasury , who imposed a stamping tax of 7 % in the 2012 budget on apartments that cost more than two million pounds and annual fees for buyers , housing as a company and not as individuals .	-4.7399
Already , revenues from stamping tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which were 708 million pounds in 2012 / 13 , combined proceeds for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-4.4679
Cook said : “ After the increases in stamp-tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against circumvention , it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the impact of the outdated community tax system . ”	-4.3576
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained about buying real estate in London , or prevent owners from selling it , ” he added .	-3.1005
First-class real estate – the top five to ten per cent of the housing market by price – in the wealthy south-west belt of London , which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon , has expended the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-4.6527
The prices in Central London had an even annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as an investigation by Saville .	-3.9670
Scientists could throw more light on the context in which the tail of a dog is in his mood .	-4.5371
Previous research showed that happy dogs were left with the tail more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while in nervous dogs it was the left .	-4.5163
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.1538
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist of the University of Trento , said : “ Human beings are well known that the left and right brain halves react differently to stimuli that causes positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.8347
Here we tried to look at this in other species .	-2.4184
He also noticed that dogs , like humans , have the right brain half responsible for the left-hand side movement , and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-4.5136
To learn more about how dogs respond to the side of the tail of their kinds , researchers monitored the animals while these films looked at other dogs .	-3.6811
They measured the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior .	-2.6756
Probably we will soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , sometimes in andity .	-3.5800
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We showed dogs with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and so we could control the movement of the tail more left or right . ”	-3.7594
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressless dog moved the tail to the right ( from the perspective of the weeding dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-3.8888
But the tail tendency was mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that clouded ) , their heart rate rose , and they looked irritating .	-5.4819
According to Professor Vallortigara , the dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-2.3907
Rather , he is convinced that dogs had learned from experience what movements they should worry about and when not .	-3.7196
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the tail is more linked to friendly behavior , and the right side produces a less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-5.0231
The researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help a better understanding of their animal ’ s emotions . !!!!!!!!!!!!!!	-12.4340
John Bradshaw , expert on dog behavior and hospitality at the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol , declared that this was not the first study investigating whether left and right is important for dogs .	-4.3492
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn the head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .	-3.0392
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was : “ Dogs go towards a robot dog , if being left and not right , rather than becoming troubled – exactly the other way than in the Italian study . ”	-5.6912
According to his statement , the differences could therefore stem from the fact that the dogs in different studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robot dogs as dogs dogdog.	-5.0317
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.2159
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs do not make an exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-11.0764
But as their behavior is simply recorded , it will probably not take long until we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-3.8353
Arctic Monkey ’ s Movement to Glasgow for the Disease of Alex Turners	-2.7970
The Rockband Arctic Monkeys postponed an appearance in Glasgow after her lead singer was ill of inflammation .	-4.1603
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday .	-2.0862

Pope Francis Named First Cardinals in February	-2.0799
Pope Francis will be called for the first time on 22 February new Cardinals of the Catholic Church , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.1452
Cardinals are the top clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope and they are also who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.0681
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.3629
However , a cardinal that has reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope election – that falls to a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-3.7027
In a statement announcing the message , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held to appoint the new cardinals , also known as consistorium .	-4.0387
“ Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the consistory in February in advance , so that other meetings that require participation of cardinals from all over the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-3.8842
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinals until February will probably have fallen .	-2.4604
He explained that a Pope usually appoints as many cardinals as necessary , so that the number of eligible cardinals is back 120 , and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants .	-4.0080
The consistory next year is important because it was the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , Valero .	-2.7355
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and particularly Italy .	-9.8780
“ It will be interesting to see if the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.0091
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-1.7637
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the formation of the Francis Council of Cardinals , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church .	-4.1409
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-1.8698
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.3306
He said that it was “ possible ” that Francis would ask for advice on the Cardinals .	-3.1497
But we have not been in this situation so far – all of this is completely new .	-4.0053
Valero said that typically bishops would call to cardinals from large places , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints ” .	-4.1658

Blockade policy does not excuse Obamacare ’ s website problems , the drone attacks	-2.5566
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad memory of what could have been done .	-11.6677
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-1.9786
I read a terribly sad book at the moment .	-2.0061
It is a book that I believed would stop me during the dead second year of my medical studies and give me hope again .	-4.1252
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama as presidential election in 2008 .	-2.8327
When I complete my patient writing in the evening and go to bed , the book leads me back to a time when politics could inspire millions and rob a speech .	-4.8933
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesperson held in mind the historical importance of this hour .	-3.2861
My classmates went before joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-3.3111
A young visionary team was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.6031
When Obama changed office in 2008 , he had approval values of 82 % .	-2.0149
And then I close the book .	-1.3579
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening as if you are torn out of a dream .	-3.5607
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed possibilities .	-2.3617
In the years since I first cast my vote , something has actually changed .	-2.1016
But it is just nothing I could have imagined .	-2.0445
I acknowledge the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-9.9028
I agree that the party political blockade tactics have fallen too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name just a few .	-3.9827
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times towards colleagues and knowledge , I ended up with my explanations .	-4.1877
I have reached one point of political despair .	-1.3987
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it is allowed to listen to foreign leaders or to kill innocent children from overseas drones .	-3.1694
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans and why whistleblowers are punished that disclose state misconduct .	-3.6218
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without procedures , nor why public financing and expenditure limits will be circumvented during the presidential elections .	-3.3635
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-2.6764
And recently it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple website in more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-12.6068
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected .	-1.2949
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns .	-2.5633
Obviously , the Office of Members is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public discussion .	-3.6976
But when I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-2.3576
And that bothers me most .	-1.1120
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.5994
With Romney , a confusing and unbalanced alternative seemed to be unable to determine his direction and positions .	-3.5060
I had the impression that a second term of office for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope that we have heard for so long .	-9.2779
But , with Obama ’ s approval falling to less than 45 % this week , returning to 2008 has become all the harder through this booboo.	-4.3437
It awakens me the desire for the many promises that have dissolved in air .	-3.7984
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to infect a serious loss against Clinton in the Pennsylvania preliminary elections .	-12.1713
At a meeting with the electoral workers following the decision , he told his staff that they should come back on track and follow the purpose of their cause .	-4.2271

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest in parental leave	-1.9058
The billionaire and MEP Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott would be in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters could become pregnant and benefit from it .	-3.7710
The mining magnat , which is in a judicial dispute over $ 6 million in CO2 tax , maintained when he wanted to wipe off the table whether he was in a conflict .	-5.2439
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or cut .	-3.3180
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would personally benefit from the laws .	-2.0881
“ He is in a major conflict of interest when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to get holidays , ” said Palmer .	-3.7003
Two months after the election , the Palmer election commission , with 53 votes , officially declared a winner of the Sunshine coast seat of Fairfax after the new count .	-14.9035
Palmer called for a review of the process of counting the vote so that it goes faster .	-4.2624

Why should we not have a system where you invade , enter data into a computer , immediately choose and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-4.1611
Palmer also criticised the use of pencils when highlighting the ballot papers .	-2.2451
Use them because you can radiate the results if you don 't like them ?	-3.7688
Voting with pencils today is incredible .	-2.5575
The Election Commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.4975

RBS suspends two foreign-exchange dealers	-1.7962
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two dealers from its foreign exchange department , two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global authoritarian investigation into alleged currency market manipulations is starting to move rapidly .	-12.9811
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in the world ’ s largest financial market investigations , where USD 5.3 trillion change owners every day .	-3.6267
The two traders would be the first RBS staff suspended in the expanding investigation that causes the scandal for the Libor interbanking business .	-4.0616
The Bank , which did not comment on suspension , confirmed this month that it received information requests from authorities .	-2.6645
“ Our investigations on this subject go further and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulators , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-3.0075
Last month , the situation stated that the RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent from and to an earlier dealer to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-3.7661
This trader , Richard Usher , had left the RBS in 2010 and is now to have been authorised by his current position as European head of the Forex Spot trade in JPMorgan .	-3.9690
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading near Citi , was held this week and Matt Gardiner , former senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.3104
None of these traders have been accused of any misconduct .	-2.1002
The Instant Message Group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup , said the situation nearby people .	-3.2889
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma declared that it investigated alleged manipulation of the foreign-exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-3.8909
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with allegations that bankers should have dealt with transactions in the monetary market .	-3.9486
HSBC , citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said people familiar with the situation .	-2.6668
Banks combine instant messages and emails from several years in search of misbehavior .	-3.1528
News of these investigations has brought merchants into turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but this year has been under pressure , because low volatility in currencies restricts opportunities for speculators .	-5.0616
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.0280
A leading trader noted that , despite the enormous daily volume in foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the different trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks means that “ you can affect the market with very low ticket prices ” .	-4.2456
The news came out the same day when Credit Suisse announced that this week , she announced a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after he lost just under six million dollars at the end of last year .	-3.9013
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and works with them .	-1.9337
“ We are sure that the trader alone acted and that the matter is contained , ” said Credit Suisse .	-2.7590
Painting the fence on the Bechtle property	-2.6428
A group of citizens ' initiative " Schweizer Wiese " has magnified the building fence on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.3504
Moreover , it cleaned and widened the walk , says it in a press release .	-3.4175
The planned covering of the falling house in the back part of the plot was not allowed for safety reasons because the terrain threatens to slip down .	-15.5972

She wanted to draw attention to the danger of even larger ruins in the Swiss meadow - the huge project one day fails .	-4.5726
In talking to many passers-by ahead of the " building site " , it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city 's project will make many better , although not a few have the same questions about the dimension of the project presented as the BI .	-5.4203
But they are beginning to resign , because the city continues to delay these answers , BI says .	-3.6194
As we heard , the Mayor 's public statements also have an impact .	-3.6180
May said at the Council meeting that he feared the exit for the thermal bath , the people should vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex in Switzerland when they debring a de.	-13.1180
Some therefore appear to be scared , others consider them a ' plumping blackmail attempt ' to the population , and the press release of the BI contintly saytakes mind . a lot a ! ! ! ..! ! ! ! !!!!!	-13.7539
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .	-1.9496
Rangnick Schelte for Shiris : Mane no Swalf King	-3.1284
Satisfied Ralf Rangnick with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg is also , so disappointed the sports director of the " bulls " of the arbitrators .	-4.3570
" There is currently a dangerous tendency that mane and Alan are pushed into the category of Swalbenkönigen , " he took protection of the two offensive winners at a press conference in Salzburg on Thursday .	-4.1677
Recent occasion for Rangnick 's criticism was yellow at 3 : 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday , where the Senegalese became an alleged acting criticism - which was not , however , as the TV pictures showed .	-6.0891
" A stark mistake , " said Rangnick , who described Harkam as " completely overstretched " .	-3.9375
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig-Trainer Adi Hutter after the game .	-2.2375
He defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved in every situation like Roger Schmidt " .	-3.1484
Schmidt himself does not want to have had contact with his colleague after the Scharmützel with hut .	-3.4374
I do not know why .	-1.0509
" For I am the one who was insulted , " emphasised the 46-year-old .	-2.8490
Given the current success , Rangnick approved a praise hymn .	-3.4894
" There are just two words for this : correctly good , " he noted .	-10.7588
There is not much to suspend .	-1.0355
Above all , the way the team plays is impressive .	-1.9035
That is how it should continue .	-3.8868
Changes in the winter transfer time will hardly exist .	-2.6252
There are no great reasons to change something .	-1.6591

Supreme Court Confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-1.3687
It is a major victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-2.8314
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional in the context of the state ’ s tax authority .	-3.6047
The chief judge John Roberts hit the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy decided against it .	-10.5650
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of law and also confirmed the view that states would either have to expand the conditions for access to Medicaid or otherwise remove all state medicaid subsidies would be unconstitutionally restrictive .	-5.7891
The action proceedings against the law had been pursued by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-3.0236
The law was firmly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the pre-election campaign in 2012 .	-3.1183
Norway : Norwegian place has giant mirrors in light	-3.6149
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their bleak valley .	-3.4848
Because of the low level of sunshine , the Rjukan in the Vestfjord Valley normally drops in the shade of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-4.4288
With three gigantic reflectors at 45 meters above sea level , a century dream became true on Wednesday .	-3.5855
" Finally ! " , swarmed mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start teremony in the TV2 station .	-3.9928
Some valley residents rightly brought sunshine , while others set up sunglasses for safety .	-5.9507
Until now , sun-starvation hungry in winter had to drive on a nearby peak .	-4.3562
Ten years ago , local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct rays into the valley with mirrors .	-2.8831

Post Hardly Empty Sundays	-2.4371
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red points for Sunday empty are still on various letterboxes of the centre and the districts , but reading the small print on the yellow Post AG containers , you quickly find out that the blogging is no longer taking place on Sunday and public holidays , " the FDP informs .	-6.7165
A request from the FDP confirmed this .	-2.1378
On Sunday and public holidays only before the postal building in Ernst-Ludwig Street 36 and Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-3.7538
Whether it is emptied on Sunday in Hofheim and Rosengarten , the answer to the FDP question will not be answered .	-9.9887
The FDP ’ s social and youth political spokesman , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to study here .	-3.5269
Sunday empty service is an important postal service at Terminpost .	-2.9524
" This company thinks radically and unreasonably , despite the price increase for letters in January 2013 " .	-3.3984
Thomas Bittner , Chairman of the Liberals , supports his fellow group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that here the space periods are changed or also deleted ' .	-5.6913
Postal services are a long way from the hot.	-3.5084
" At least the letter boxes in the Neuschloss and Rosengarten need to be emptied again on Sundays , " says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-3.5223
Even the centre of the city , especially non-mobile fellow citizens would have to reach a letter box with Sunday empty .	-10.4199
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the municipal administration is planning talks with the post on this matter .	-4.0169
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.7892
But there is also Sunday empty in Hofheim .	-2.6913
Your party voted in favour of privatisation .	-2.5264
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere " , said Maier .	-1.8839
Frankfurt Park Charges Shar.	-10.7245
Parking in Frankfurt may soon become more expensive .	-8.8923
This morning 's magistrate advises Stefan Majer ( Green ) on a submfor trdecerner .	-9.5906
Therefore , parking fees are to be increased by 50 % .	-2.9073
However , this should not increase prices , but shorten the interval of parking watches and automatic parking machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-4.7576
In December , the Assembly of Municipalities will have to decide .	-3.3653
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-2.8289

Freudenstadt : Overstart Host	-6.8114
With a narrow cadre , the masters I of the TSV Freudenstadt had to enter the Schiller Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb .	-4.1165
The Elblers were on the other side with an experienced team .	-2.9562
Soon , however , it became apparent that , even age-related , it could not keep up with the fast actions of joy towns .	-5.3580
The Gönninger did extremely difficult with the hard and placed premiums .	-3.5827
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks received by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz cleanly across the centre of the net and were not in place in the block defense .	-4.5157
Two high first sentence profits clearly expressed the superiority of joy cities in all matters .	-3.5958
Given this overwhelming and game-determining achievement , the third sentence was gained somewhat lax and funny to the 3 : 0 end ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-13.6780
On 2 November , the TV Baiersbronn , which could clearly prevail in Nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent on the field .	-4.2663
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pälchen , Stefan Räller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-1.7035
In the B-class , the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were opposed to the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-3.2926
They delivered a hard-contested two-hour match .	-1.6956
Nervousness on both sides caused mainly errors and points gifts when accepting ball ; even in passports , precision was sometimes a defective good and in some critical scenes the overcrowder prevented the view of possible point gains .	-6.7427
In this very balanced encounter , however , the TSV team of Marcus Blasutto consistently voted for the great physical application and a pleasant commitment of both teams .	-5.3713
Maintenance Day at the Small English Cabin disb!.	-9.7792
A group of committed participants met at the small English cottage in Ibach on the fifth day of care in the succession of the Natura 2000 project .	-4.3255
Due to suggestions from the population , this day in the area of the hut of the valley should be cut off , mayor Helmut Emperor said .	-4.9034
Many hikers described this area as the gloss of the gorge climbing , on which the landscape provides the ideal setting for splendid views .	-5.2777
He thanked the present for her willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care is a suitable tool for strengthening the connection between people and nature .	-4.1926
It offers every citizen the opportunity to emphasise in nature itself .	-2.7540
At the same time , the tourist aspect could also be taken into account environmentally .	-3.3074
This ecological aspect explained Friederike Tribukait from the Nature Protection Department of the Bureau of Government , following the welcome of Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wished the action a good success .	-4.4282
According to Tribukait , the tourist destination of the foresight is aimed at maintaining the highly growing old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitats by opening and connecting to the existing pastures .	-6.1779
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass shepherds , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areareas . ffffffffffin . f	-15.7637

Tribukait said she does not want to fail here to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-2.8897
The current measure does not merely fit in with this planning .	-3.1466
A biosphere area also provides an opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status , thereby continuously complementing the achievements of the Life project as well as the care days before .	-5.4181
According to these various speeches , Revierleiter Christoph Wehle and Life project manager Cornelia Bischoff divided the helpers into groups .	-3.7012
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance and the forest trawler may be available .	-3.6670
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of jackpots and the maintenance of a dry line .	-3.7483
The aim was the free view of the prospect .	-2.4116

Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nortel patents	-1.7520
The group , which owns thousands of previous Nortel patents , strictly adopted a avalanche of complaints on Thursday for patent infringements against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was overbidden during the insolvency auction of Nortel .	-5.1138
Rockstar , the consortium that bought the Nortel patents for USD 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringements in Texas .	-10.5203
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.8709
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.6320
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , such as the complaint that affects the core of Google 's search engine business .	-11.8145
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-1.9515
Samsung , Huawei and HTC produce mobile phones working with Google ’ s operating system Android , which is in sharp competition with Apple ’ s and Microsoft mobile products .	-9.8419
In 2011 , Google issued an initial commandment of more than $ 900 million for the Nortel patents .	-1.9681
Google increased its supply several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-2.6537
After surpassing the Nortel patents by Rockstar , Google Motorola Mobility acquired USD 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola 's library of patents .	-15.3431
“ Although Google has failed to acquire patents of complaints in the auction , Google has infringed and continues to do so , ” says the action .	-4.7560
Rockstar calls for a high compensation of Google , because it claims that Google 's patent infringement is deliberate , the accusation .	-11.9015
Egypt ’ s Freely-Elected Presidents votes f. !!!!!!!!!!!	-12.9541
Mohammed Morsi dismisses office , but his day of triumph should not mean the end of political disputes in Egypt .	-3.2596
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country , thereby came to the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier .	-4.3178
With its introduction before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth head of state since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-3.0970
He dismissed the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes , who are based on the Nile and who feel an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.6820
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt , and a second Republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony that was transferred live on state tele.	-10.5189
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood in the United States , a fundamentalist group that has been usually targeted as a banned organization by the respective government since it was founded 84 years ago .	-4.9070
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen watch the building when Morsi arrived in a small autoconvoi shortly after 11 a.m. local time .	-15.8902
Only a few hundred supporters had assembled before the court to celebrate the new president , and unlike the presidential drunk from the Mubarak period , traffic was only stopped shortly so that the Autokonvoi could cross the usually lively road that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-5.3686
As an uncharismatic “ substitute bike ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he not only presented himself as a candidate of the Islamists , but all those who wanted to put the 2011 insurgency to the target against authoritarian Mubarak .	-5.0245
“ Egypt is today a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , declared the judges in the wood-paneled chamber in which he laid office .	-4.7757
Later , Morsi drove to the University of Cairo , where he should keep his inaugural speech .	-2.9480
It was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem that he listened to in habitat placement .	-9.9937
The military leader Feldmarschall Hussein Tantawi was present .	-1.9653
At his arrival , he was welcomed by hundreds of people present in the largest hearing hall of the university with speeches from “ The Army and the People are one hand . ”	-4.2010
The University of Cairo , built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , has become a highbury of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .	-3.0430
On Friday , Morsi deposited a symbolic oath in the Tahir Square , the birthplace of the uprising that led last year to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and he vowed to demand presidential powers that the Military Council had taken over from office .	-4.4397
However , by putting the official oath before the court and not , as usual , before Parliament , it is bowing to the military ’ s will , which points out that the struggle for power will continue .	-5.4237
Morsi ’ s speech at the Tahir Square was full of dramatic populist gestures .	-1.6072

Flight Centre seems to be opposed to the trend .	-1.4686
The company has increased its profit prospects for the year as a whole and expects record revenues from Australia and the United Kingdom hholi.	-5.3177
The travel company is now assuming an adjusted annual earnings before taxes between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305-315 million in its previous forecast .	-4.2756
If the current target values are achieved , that means growth from 12 to 17 % compared to the record gain of $ 290.4 million in 2011-12 .	-3.6501
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre made eight percent profit in the first half of the year and bought a strong start to the second half year , especially in Australian and British private business .	-3.9164
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are in good direction towards record revenue from interest and taxes , ” he said .	-3.9953
These include Australia and Britain , typically among our most powerful results .	-3.0052
In Australia , the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year , offsetting a slightly weaker market for business travel .	-2.8196
It was similarly good for Flight Centre ’ s leisure activities in the UK , while business customers spent less here .	-4.0244

Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-0.9084
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Protestant church communities Salem , the Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance .	-3.0213
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum how today people classify the ' last things ' after death .	-3.6259
If people in the past centuries had known too much about it , putting on those images of heaven and hell , ' which still shape our ideas ' , the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completing rather than a certain embarrassment or even language .	-6.3129
" The greater hope has been expulsed by religious criticism by Christians , " says the speaker .	-3.0913
You have provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks appear to have lost us .	-4.1576
Johanna Rahner continues to say : ' But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death ' .	-2.4836
That connects with the question of the longing , ' which dreams that everything may be good at the end ' .	-4.5879

You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as the “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-3.2640
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-1.9725
For 21 years , Georges Bwelle looked at how his sick father repeatedly lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals who did not have the means to hhelp it .	-10.3750
Jamef Bwelle was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.0652
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation that extended to his brain and caused a hematom to affect him for the rest of his life .	-3.5287
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwelle .	-1.9303
We would have put it out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.2583
Instead , Bwelle spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.2085
“ It ’ s not easy , ” comments Bwelle .	-2.7588
You can leave the house at five o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and is not the first .	-3.5706
There are many patients .	-1.4558
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.7036
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelles ’ father died in 2002 .	-11.7591
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for 5,000 people , the World Health Organization .	-2.6106
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States lies with a doctor for 413 people .	-2.1956
But even if there were a doctor for them , most Camerooners could not afford to visit .	-2.9621
Two out of five people live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country are private .	-2.0984
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-1.4767
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.9578
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered in Bwele made the decision to do something about it .	-3.2193
Dr. Georges Bwelle and his volunteer carried out 700 free operations last year .	-2.1968
He became a doctor himself and works as a vessel surgeon in the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-2.6082
Furthermore , he founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.5394
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-1.5919
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people force themselves into small buses and drive with the tied medical equipment on the roof over unfortified terrain to the villages who need help .	-4.4233
Not always everything is smooth .	-2.1781
Even more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-8.4685
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a festivity , vocals and dance , and the best accommodation to offer the pl.	-4.1923
In these villages , free medical care is really a reason for celebrating and waving – with its broad smile and borderless energy – is happy to celebrate .	-4.7542
Next morning the team will begin with the investigation of hundreds of patients .	-2.9644
“ Per ride we treat 500 people ” , says Bwele .	-3.7891
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and on foot .	-3.0140
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.1860
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-11.4089
Other receive crucifications , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document required for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.2044
In the evening , the team performs simple operations with local stunning .	-2.6759
The operations typically take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the intervention , the patients stand up and go into the recreation area to make space for the next .	-13.8967
Lighting for the OP and disinfection equipment is fed by the group generator , thus working bwell and his volunteers until early hours on Sunday .	-4.4854
It is a hard pensum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.9603
“ You drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-3.2450
On Sunday , the team then goes back to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-2.7483
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that , with its work , it creates a huge difference for the people it helps .	-4.1586
A man explained that the free operation of a breakdown that he received now allowed him to work again .	-3.2159
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.0813
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-3.1915
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , says Bwell ; the rest come from private donations .	-2.9828
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and volunteers in Bwelles Group .	-3.2758
It is either in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so that it can go to these campaigns .	-3.7895
For medical and health care students such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support wave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-3.6247
“ We can be with operations where we help to collapse blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwelle , ” explains O 'Malley .	-11.8678
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.7257
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitary material to them . for peoppeople fin .	-13.8088
But once in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over accommodation , transport and guidance .	-3.0596
" He is no doubt a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.3720
He devotes his life to this organization and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no limits .	-2.5798
For bwave , the almost permanent work is not a burden .	-3.3613
Helping others to make a happier life , thereby fulfilling a promise that he gave to his father , gives him great pleasure .	-3.7880
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-1.9937
And I think of my father .	-1.1778
I hope he sees what I do .	-0.9571
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.8336

Mastering the Fight Excellently	-1.9016
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingways Novelle " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to the body Horst Janson .	-2.8290
Janson himself is an old hare in his Metier , the Art of Acts .	-10.7730
No one can fool the old man Santiago when fishing .	-2.4547
So the two complement themselves great .	-8.7467
You almost think that you can see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of whom the fishing boy speaks Manolo .	-9.2900
When Santiago is tired of life bent on the chair , that is real at Janson .	-2.7492
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently .	-2.6249
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish by his knowledge and also his will .	-14.9803
Janson is on stage in large distances as a single star .	-4.4893
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on himself , so his monologues are not boring at a moment .	-3.4226
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are real that the viewers forget that the sea consists of only blue-lit water bottles .	-4.1465
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.5428
During the performance he puts the active scene into light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her beautiful voice , describes the feeling of life of Cuba .	-4.9891
The four musicians play rhythm and are also the guests of the bar .	-3.3842
Tourism : Decline to the Romans	-1.6296
On about 120 meters below Cologne a sewage channel from the Roman era is preserved .	-4.1138
Anyone who visits Cologne will not get over at the Cathedral .	-3.0476
Around 157 meters wear the two towers in the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.1724
But few visitors who admire the two filigreen church towers suggest that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-4.1106
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of Cologne underworld .	-2.2176
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne tourism directly at the Duomo .	-10.8592
The tour begins quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground car " , says Schulze .	-2.8207
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted a car-friendly city , and therefore the remains of the old city walls remained only what was not too big .	-4.2655
Therefore , most users of the car park are overcoming the Roman remains today and only departing their car .	-5.8797
But whoever looks closer at the Parkdeck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated from metal grating bars .	-4.2416
Approximately five metres high ruins made of traditional stones can be seen .	-4.6755
" It is the remains of the Roman city walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " says Schulze .	-2.8486
Before returning to daylight , Schulze lets the participants at the upper park level take a look at a dark , 15 metres deep chess . bring bacbirth to the .	-13.2584
This is the well of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly perceived .	-2.7254
The next station of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants are rising down to the depth .	-4.2833
We are witnessing the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the predator of the CCAA .	-3.6314
As far as CCAA is concerned , a visitor would like to .	-8.0979
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in good German as " City of Roman Law and City of Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius in the place of the Altar for the Emperor Cult " .	-4.0438
And the pretorium is the former Statthald Palace , the center of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-13.8828
From the outside of the exhibition , tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is preserved here at about 120 meters .	-4.9003
" You can go along a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want , " muntert Schulze up the guests .	-3.6517
Schulze still has a surprise .	-1.6869
After bringing the key at the checkout , it leads the group to a 16-meter deep , walkable chess .	-4.5083
" We are now in the mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.7735
The Jewish community built its bath deep into the ground to come to the groundwater , which was essential for ritual washing .	-3.5006
To this day , different water stands can be read in the lower end of the micro , whose origins date back to the eighth century by changing levels of the Rhine .	-4.8984
The mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square , for which the construction works will soon begin .	-3.9929
However , a few years will go to completion .	-3.2576
Recycling Rocker	-2.6391
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is re-rolled after more than four years .	-2.4460
A process began in front of the Frankfurt Court of Frankfurt ( Oder ) for attempting to death , dangerous body injury and damage to two 30-year-olds .	-6.6587
It is accompanied by rigorous safeguards .	-11.1379
The accused weigh to begin .	-3.1014
They should have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the bandidos at that time .	-3.2792
The Public Prosecutor accused them of entering and engaging in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt .	-4.1965
All victims were seriously injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .	-2.2607
The victims should have heard Hells Angels competing .	-2.3736
One is to have been a high-level member of Berlin .	-2.4590
Apparently a persecution hunt with several cars was preceded .	-2.8915
According to charge , there were revival struggles and a demonstration of power .	-3.3357
The two defendants were released in early 2012 in a first procedure .	-2.9450
A court spokesman said at that time that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloodman 's fail.	-5.0648
The perpetrators had worn masks and were not recognized .	-1.9691
The Federal Court repealed the judgment following the revision of the Public Prosecutor and referred it back to the Court for the renegotiation .	-4.2810

At the beginning , it was primarily about reconstructing the processes during the night .	-4.5400
The Commissioner investigating it was witnessing .	-3.4580
The centre was mobile phone calls from the defendants and other persons who had listened to the police .	-3.7556
It is difficult that rockers in court almost always abide by a law that is rather rather than telling them .	-4.9278
This also applies to the victims .	-1.3232
In the first process , only one of the victims had packed out .	-1.8560

The Disposable Society Does not Think	-2.6517
The night was long , the music loud and the atmosphere good , but at some point it goes home .	-3.0960
But hunger becomes noticeable in people ’ s streams on passenger and rear seats .	-4.9067
Clearly , one cocktail or another may be responsible for this !	-3.1222
What is closer to driving chills to the next drive in order to enjoy a little bit ?	-3.8861
I admit I am happy to do so when we go to Fastfood Holen late night or early morning .	-4.5218
A few pommes , a cola , a castle - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-2.5283
But the obvious differences between myself and other hungry disco corpses are noticeable at home .	-4.4381
Because what must be missing from the car window with constant regularity ? !	-13.5053
Above all during the weekends there are paper bags on roads and parking lots .	-4.6759
'Why ? ' , I ask myself .	-1.4060
Are people too doof to take the bags home respectively until the next garbage ?	-3.2979
It is not just that the paper product negotiates the landscape .	-2.5935
Bets have also already covered transport facilities such as guiding planks , causing accidents .	-4.0303
That is what said ' disposable society ' does not think , but probably does not even know what that word actually means .	-5.3042
If you are on the move in the evening , you know what a return bank can look like : clothes , bottles and other rubbish towers there .	-5.4939
There would be a few bags more or less nix , unlike the road , where none wants to rumble on the remains of others .	-5.8560
I already see the day when towns and communities will have to demand the fastfood chains for their bags .	-5.5355
Obama ’ s Return to Health Policy	-1.6453
After heavy criticism , President Obama yesterday made a withdrawal of his frequently repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-3.3924
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of notice , the Republicans pretended to the president over the last few days that he had misled the American pu.	-15.3692
Yesterday , Obama relativated his original promise .	-1.5352
“ The vast majority of citizens who have functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-2.6113
In response to the many media reports on redundancies , Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance .	-3.2140
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or more favourably than predicted .	-3.5092
“ You get a better offer , ” he said .	-1.9554
The government described it as little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have completed an insurance would have to look at a different tariff , because their treaty does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-4.8895
“ I would like to say to these Americans very directly : they deserve better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Committee on Energy and Trade in Washin.	-3.4958
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , declared that the launch of the online platform was “ miserable ” since October .	-2.9573
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everybody else , ” she said . .	-7.0894
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.6316
After a dispute with the Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri , this declaration of a raised Sebelius as an adviser behind her sitting at yesterday 's hearing in the House of Representatives was included in Missouri , whether she was obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-5.8184
After more than three hours of consultation , Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ architect ” did not voluntarily refrain from state-funded insurance to complete a rate at HealthCare.gov , which she wanted to sell millions of Americans .	-4.6165
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syrian air base	-2.4178
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday to the American news station CNN that Israeli fighter aircraft had previously attacked an aircraft base in Syrian Latakia .	-3.9388
The aim was ' missiles and associated equipment ' , feared by the Israeli Government that they were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , according to the CNN .	-3.4710
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab station Al Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was decided on Thursday night from Wednesday , and the Israelis blamed for it .	-3.7340
The Israeli television station Channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , where Russian defense missiles were seen from the type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 rockets , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and can transport explosives up to 70 kilograms .	-4.8659
Uncertain , the Jerusalem Government has officially not confirmed the attack .	-2.4419
However , the news agency , Reuters , also quotes an anonymous Israeli government official with the words that he believes Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .	-4.1744
At any rate , one spokesman of the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We do not comment on these reports ' .	-2.6104
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasised in the daily newspaper Yedioth Ahronoth that the Syrian regime had already tried , sometimes successful , to deliver soil air missiles to Hezbollah .	-3.8463
The Israeli Government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means crossing a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-2.9083
John Kerry said in an unprecedented admission that the US spy had “ gone inappropriately too far ”	-3.0855
John Kerry suggested , with an unexpected admission , that the US ’ s defensive attitude toward its monitoring programs indicated that , in certain cases , spying had “ gone inappropriately too far . ”	-5.0301
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for turning on “ autopilot , ” when the explosive revelations of the whistleblower Edward Snowden were published about NSA ’ s spy activities .	-4.2216
Leaked information has made the US government a diplomatic storm of indignation by its allies .	-3.0884
In a video connection speech at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ The President and I , as well as others in the government , learned of some things that had almost passed by autopilot , simply because the capacity was to do what remained due to the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War and , of course , to 11 September . ”	-6.2765
Afterwards , he first admitted that the US government had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights were abused .	-3.8247
He said , “ In some cases , this has gone inappropriately too far . ”	-2.1766
The President is determined to clarify and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that nobody must feel abused here .	-3.6863
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-2.1332
Kerry , however , insisted that the NSA was a power of good and that its monitoring operations saved many lives .	-3.6264
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.6209
There is a radical extremism in the world that is missing to kill people , blow into the air , and attack governments .	-2.5247
So what if we were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?	-2.6532
We have actually prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people , because we have learned about such plans before the end of the pro.	-5.3288
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel the concerns about alleged American spying and to convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorist efforts , as the chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on European Affairs on Thursday .	-4.0651
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said that he spoke with representatives of the European Parliament and others this week , and I am concerned about their threats to no longer participate in anti-terrorist organisations because of the frustration over the monitoring of the National Security Agency .	-4.2909
“ It is very important for the United States ’ national security interests that Europeans remain on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism , ” said Murphy , who is a democrat sitting in the Senate for the first time and working as chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-4.1932
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-2.8919
Media reports that the NSA has collected millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , although the head of the secret service this week declared that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-3.7299
Other revelations quoted from documents passed by Snowden that the NSA monitored the phone by Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-3.1651
The head of national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended spying for allies as necessary and said that it was common on on both sides .	-3.6153
In all the tumult , Murphy , his authority prepared the trip of the Congress to take place this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers .	-3.3665
The names of the other participating Members are to be published in the coming days .	-10.3568
He said that the exact travel route was still being worked out .	-2.9690
While Murphy stressed that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-2.6814
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programmes they have been using for years .	-3.4723
“ While we can change our monitoring programmes and thus protect Europeans ’ rights better , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only spying , ” says Murphy .	-3.4508
Meanwhile , John Kerry is travelling to the Middle East and Poland at the weekend to deal with the grip over the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , and US surveillance activities .	-10.9023

Australia lays down appeals to prison in Thailand	-2.5994
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney , who was sentenced to 15 days in Phuket , because she mistakenly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver , has appealed against the decision and was released on deposit .	-3.9618
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a false statement after she indicated to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped them in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June , while two other men held them .	-4.6312
Later , however , the recordings of a video camera showed that she had reached her hotel safely after she was separated from her Australian friend .	-3.1543
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until it stood up to the story .	-3.6726
Until the trial , it was in police custody on the ground .	-3.4254
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-security detention centre at the edge of Phuket , rather than in prison for adult women .	-3.8481
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who has appealed to the Foreign Ministry in Canberra with the request for help for his daughter .	-3.1865
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely worried ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-2.8696
“ We are of course very concerned , but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.4658
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is opposed to a deposit of 50,000 Baht at large .	-3.0002
In Australian reports it was read that it makes holidays in the resort of Krabi in South Thailand .	-3.4056
The court heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-4.0343
However , it is also possible that after the recent murder of Michelle Smith ’ s travel purchaser in Phuket , Thailand might be trying to improve his struggling tourist image , and that is why there is an opportunity .	-5.9205
