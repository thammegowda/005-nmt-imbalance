Walisian meteors " see themselves as Dödel " .	-5.3620
There is consternation among some Members of the Assembly on a proposal to change their title to MWPs ( Member of the Welsh Parliament ) .	-4.8584
The reason for this was plans to change the name of the National Assembly in Walisisches Parliament .	-4.2629
Members of all parties in the National Assembly are concerned that they could be ridiculed .	-4.2516
A Labour MEP said that his group ' rejoines with Twp and Pwp ' .	-3.3694
Note to the reader : “ twp ” in Welsh means “ taxed ” and “ pwp ” means “ cacke ” .	-4.6727
A meeting member of Plaid Cymru said that the group as a whole is " not happy " and has proposed alternatives .	-2.6240
A Welsh Conservative said that his group would be “ open ” to a name change , but pointed out that it is only a brief verbal leap to “ Muppet ” from “ MWP ” ( a member of the Welsh Parliament ) .	-6.0431
Note : The Welsh letter W is pronounced in the same way as U in English .	-2.3090
The National Assembly Commission , which is currently working on a draft bill for the name changes , said : ‘ The final decision on the name of members of the National Assembly is , of course , up to the members themselves . ’	-5.0516
The Government of Wales Act 2017 allowed the Welsh Parliament to change its name .	-2.0889
In June last year , the Commission published the results of a public hearing on the proposals , whereby the name change in the Welsh Parliament is widely supported .	-4.8754
On the issue of the membership title , the Commission preferred Welsh MEPs or WMPs , but the MFP option received most support in a public consultation .	-3.9235
Members of the Welsh Parliament apparently propose alternative options , but the fight to reach a consensus could cause headaches for President Elin JONES , who is expected to present a bill for these changes in the coming weeks .	-5.0301
The reform legislation will include changes in the functioning of the Assembly , including the rules on disqualification of members of the Welsh Parliament and the design of the suspension system .	-4.8874

Macedonians hold a referendum on amending the name of the country .	-2.3780
On Sunday , voters will vote to amend the name of the country to ‘ Republic of North Macedonia ’ .	-5.7442
The referendum is held to settle a decades-old dispute with neighboring Greece , in which a province bears the name of Macedonia .	-2.9540
Athens has long insisted that the name of its northern neighbour is a claim to its territory and has repeatedly objected to his application for membership of the EU and NATO .	-4.2164
Macedonian President Gjorge Ivanov , an opponent of the referendum on the name change , said he would ignore the vote .	-2.2373
The referendum ’ s advocates , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue , however , that the name change is simply the price to be paid for joining the EU and NATO .	-3.6126
The bell of St. Martin disappeared because churches in Harlem have problems .	-3.3939
" Historically , the old people with whom I spoke said that there was a bar and a church on every corner , " said Mr Adams .	-4.0377
“ There is neither now nor . ”	-3.4167
He said that the disappearance of bars is understandable .	-1.4656

As far as churches are concerned , he fears that the money from the sale of assets will not last for as long as the leaders expect .	-3.4883
Churches could be replaced by multi-family houses with housing filled with the kind of people who will not help the remaining sanctuaries of the district .	-4.2437
The overwhelming majority of people who buy condominiums in these buildings will be white , he said , ' and will therefore speed up the day when these churches are closed entirely , as it is unlikely that most of those who enter these condominiums will become members of these churches ' .	-5.4989
Both churches were built by white communities before Harlem became the black metropolis in 1870 – the Metropolitan Community , St. Martin ’ s a decade later .	-2.6316
The original white Methodist community set out in the 1930 ’ s .	-3.2300
A black municipality , which had a religion nearby , bought the building .	-4.6500
St. Martin 's was taken over by a black community under the priest John Howard Johnson , who led to a boycott of retailers in the 125 road , a main road to shopping in Harlem , who resisted the recruitment or promotion of black .	-5.8733
A fire in 1939 left the building badly damaged , but when the community members of Father Johnson made plans for reconstruction , they called the bell game .	-4.2866
Christchurch David Johnson , son of Father Johnson and successor to St Martin 's , proudly called the bell play “ the bells of the poor . ”	-4.3224
The expert who played the bell game in July called it another thing : ' A cultural treasure ' and ' an irreplaceable historical instrument ' .	-3.4199
The expert Tiffany Ng from the University of Michigan also noted that it was the first bell game in the world played by a black musician , Dionisio A. Lind , who , 18 years ago , moved to the larger bell game at Riverside Church .	-4.6754
Mr Merriweather said that St. Martin 's did not replace him .	-2.1531
What took place in the last few months at St. Martin was a complicated history of architects and builders , some of which were presented by the Laienleiter of the Church , others by the bishop ’ s diocese .	-6.4799
The sacristy – the parish ’ s governing body made up of Laien<unk> ’ s leaders – wrote to the diocese in July with the concern that the diocese “ would try to pass the costs on to the sacristy ” , although the sacristy was not involved in the appointment of the architects and contractors of the Diocese .	-7.4365
Some local members complained about a lack of transparency on the part of the diocese .	-3.3023

On Saturday , a shark attacked a 13-year-old boy and injured him , while in California , on the opening day of the Hummer season , he told officials .	-5.0415
The attack took place shortly before seven o 'clock in the morning near the beach of Beacon in Encin.	-3.0334
Chad Hammel said KSWB-TV in San Diego that he had been sailing with friends for half an hour on Saturday morning when he was screaming at the boy for help , and then he was assaulted with the others to save him from the water .	-7.7317
“ First of all , I thought someone happy because he caught a hummer , ” said Hammel , but then I noticed that someone screamed : “ I was torn ! ”	-5.8926
I have been bitten !	-1.7237
His whole key leg was torn up , says Hammel , he found it when he came to the boy .	-5.3683
I shouted to everyone to get out of the water : ' There is a shark in the water ! ' said Hammel .	-3.6148
The boy was brought to the Rady Children 's Hospital in San Diego , where his condition was documented as critical .	-2.6444
The Haiart responsible for the attack is unknown .	-1.3938
Rescue swimmer Captain Larry Giles said that a shark had been spotted in the area a few weeks earlier , but it was discovered that it was not a dangerous shark .	-4.4210
Giles added traumatic injuries to his victim 's upper body .	-2.4981
Officials closed access to the beach at Ponto Beach in Casabad to Swami 's in Ecinitas for 48 hours for security reasons .	-4.3012
Giles found that there are more than 135 people in the area , but most of them are not considered dangerous .	-3.0979
Sainsbury is planning to conquer the British beauty market .	-3.5781
Sainsbury 's takes over boars , superdrug , and kennms with shelves with beauty products , which are filled with specialist assistants .	-7.3084
As part of an extensive push in the British beauty market in the UK , which is still growing and worth <unk> 2.8bn , fashion and homeware sales will fall back .	-10.6410
The idea of investing in the beauty market stems from the fact that supermarkets are looking for ways to use the Regal Square , which was used for televisions , microwaves and household goods for new products .	-5.8082
Sainsbury announced that the range of beauty products will be doubled to 3000 products , including , for the first time , brands such as Revlon , Essie , Twezerman and Dr. PawPawPawPawPaw .	-4.7658
Existing L 'Oreal , Maybelline and Burt 's Bees collars will also be given more space in brand areas similar to those found in shops like boating .	-5.0039
The supermarket chain also revives its own “ Boutique ” brand , which has many popular vegan products for young buyers .	-4.7382
In addition , the perfume dealer Fragrance Shop is testing concessions in two Saginburys shops , the first of which was opened last week in Croydon , South London , while a second end of this year is opened at Selly Oak , Birmingham .	-5.7396
Online shopping and a shift to the daily purchase of small quantities of food in neighborhood shops mean that supermarkets need to do more to get people to visit .	-4.8930
Mike Coupe , the head of Sainsbury 's , has said that sales outlets will increasingly look like department stores , because the supermarket chain is trying to combat discolountents like Aldi and Lidl with more services and non-food .	-5.7972
Sainsbury 's has placed Argos Outlets in hundreds of shops and has also introduced a number of habitats since it bought both chains two years ago , supposedly strengthening food sales and making acquisitions more profitable .	-4.8672
The former attempt by the supermarket to revise its plastic and pharmacist departments ended with a failure .	-3.9439
Sainsbury has tested a joint venture with boat in the early 2000s , but it ended unetchieden , and income from pharmacies could not be shared .	-4.0869
The new strategy comes after Sainsbury 's sold its 281 branch pharmacist store three years ago for <unk> 125 million on Celesio , the owner of Lloyds Pharmacy chain .	-4.7599
Lloyds is also expected to be involved in four Lloyds Stores .	-7.7460
Paul Mills-Hicks , director of Sainsbury , said : “ We have changed the appearance of our beauty products shelves to improve the equipment for our customers .	-5.9154
In addition , we have invested in training staff to assist the customer .	-3.8539
Our brand portfolio leaves no wish unfulfilled .	-4.5848

The This Morning Host announced to Instagram that she will go .	-2.3680
Holly Willoughby made Dragons ' Den-tar Peter Jones angry because she had withdrawn from her common lucrative lifestyle brand at the last minute to focus on her new madness contract with Marks & Spencer and ITV .	-6.1764
Sources say that Jones was angry when the Golden Girl of television during a tense meeting on Tuesday at the headquarters of his business empire in Marlow , Buckinghamshire , admitted that their new shops , worth up to <unk> 1.5 million , meant that they had no longer had enough time to dedicate themselves to their home and accessory brand Truly .	-6.3043
The business was compared to the Goop brand of Gwyneth Paltrow , and it was assumed that it would double Willoughby ’ s assets of an estimated <unk> 11 million .	-5.2297
When Willoughby , 37 , announced on Instagram that it would leave Truly , Jones left Britain and flew to one of his homes .	-3.3814
One source said , “ It was really high on Hollywood ’ s list of priorities . ”	-3.6007
It should be its long-term future and secure it for the next few decades .	-2.3043
Their decision to withdraw was utterly unsettling for all concerned .	-4.3959
No one could believe what happened on Tuesday – just before the start .	-2.5600
" At Marlow HQ there is a warehouse full of goods that can be sold . "	-2.8535
Experts believe that the " This Morning " Moderator , which is one of Britain 's top banking stars , could cost the company millions because it has invested heavily in products such as pillows , candles , clothing and homewear , and because of the potential for further delays in the market launch .	-6.5938
And it could mean the end of a long friendship .	-1.8352
For ten years , Willouching and his man , Dan Baldwin , Jones , and his wife Tara Capp have been close by .	-4.2520
Willoughby established Truly with Capp in 2016 and Jones in 52 , as president in March .	-4.9246

Why has President Trump made so many compromises ?	-1.4366
That is what Trump said in his mocked “ spokesperson for news . ”	-2.7428
“ I have not made any compromises . ”	-2.0246
He noted Kim ’ s interest in a second meeting after Trump ’ s first meeting in Singapore in June welcomed Kim as a major step toward denuclearization of North Korea .	-3.5444
But the disarmament negotiations have been blocked .	-2.6160
More than three months after the Singapore summit in June , Ri Yong Ho , the leading diplomat of North Korea , told the United Nations leaders , General Assembly on Saturday that the North does not see a ' corresponding response ' from the US to North Korea 's early disarmament measures .	-5.5216
Instead , he stated , the US continues the sanctions to sustain pressure .	-3.4230
Trump took a much more optimistic stance in his speech .	-2.0846
“ We are doing well with North Korea , ” he said .	-3.0799
“ We wanted to war with North Korea .	-1.7408
Millions of people would have been killed .	-0.5948
Now we have this great relationship . ”	-1.4558
He said that his efforts to improve relations with Kim have yielded positive results , such as the end of missile tests , the liberation of hostages , and the transfer of the mortal remains of American soldiers back home .	-3.9341
And he defended his unconventional approach when he talked about relations with Kim .	-1.8851
" It ’ s so easy to be president-in-office , but instead of having 10,000 people out there trying to enter this fully packed arena , about 200 people would be there , " said Trump and showed the crowd directly ahead of him .	-9.4323
In Indonesia , a tsunami and an earthquake kill hundreds and desolate an island .	-7.0236
After the earthquake in Lombok , for example , foreign non-governmental organisations were told that they were not needed .	-2.1105
Although more than 10 % of the Lombok population has been resettled , no national disaster has been declared , a prerequisite for the catalyst for international aid .	-4.2154
Summary said : ' Unfortunately , in many cases , they made it very clear that they did not request international aid , so it is a small challenge ' ,	-4.3232
While Save the Children brings together a team to travel to Palu , it is not yet certain that foreign personnel can work on the ground .	-4.0764
The speaker of the national civil protection agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would assess the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations can contribute to the aid .	-3.8320
Unfortunately , in view of the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly experiencing , the country is not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-5.2666
While the tsunamis shelter areas in Aceh were built , what is not common for other coastal lines .	-5.7344
The apparent absence of a tsunami-warning sirene in Palu , although a warning was already in force , may have contributed to the loss of human lives .	-3.9877
Even under favourable conditions , travel between the many islands of Indonesia is difficult .	-2.6774
Natural disasters make logistics even more complicated .	-1.5331
A Lazarettship stationed for the treatment of the earthquake victims in Lombok is on the way to Palu , but it will take at least three days before it arrives in the place of the new disaster .	-5.0546

The Cromwell Parliament ’ s statue will be the youngest historical success of the series “ Rewrite History ” .	-5.7590
His exile would be poetic justice for his talic-like destruction of so many of England 's cultural and religious artifacts by his fanatical puritans .	-4.9220
The Cromwell Society , however , described Mr Cricks ’ proposal as “ folly ” and as a “ attempt to rewrite history . ”	-3.0772
John Goldsmith , Chairman of the Cromwell Society , said this : “ Given the current debate on the removal of statues , it was inevitable that the figure of Oliver Cromwell would be targeted before the Westminster Palace . ”	-3.8912
The iconoclasm of the British civil war was neither ordered nor performed by Cromwell .	-4.3235
Perhaps the wrong Cromwell would be sacrificed to the actions of his ancestors , Thomas , in the last century .	-3.2839
Sir William Hamo Thornycroft ’ s magnificent display of Cromwell shows the view that prevailed in the 19th century and that Cromwell ’ s worth is still dominating in history .	-8.1035
Mr Goldsmith said on the Sunday Telegraph : ‘ Cromwell is seen by many , perhaps more in the late 19th century than today , as a defender of Parliament against pressure from outside , in his case of course the monarchy .	-4.1854
Whether it is an absolutely correct representation is the subject of the ongoing historical debate .	-3.1858
To be sure , the conflict in the middle of the 17th century formed the subsequent development of our nation , and Cromwell is an individual visible figure that stands for one side of the divide .	-4.6781
His achievements as Lord Protector are also worth reminding and celebrating . ”	-2.4218

America ’ s Artificial Intelligence spending	-2.0591
As China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI-stakeholders who worked for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-3.9228
These demands came about after US government announcements of AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-4.5394
China has now presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the AI innovation sector .	-3.8825
“ doubling spending on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries lag far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is about to come , ” said Lee .	-5.1535
The doubling of funding could double the chances of the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.0430
Lee , whose book “ AI superpower : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the new world order ) ” was published by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt this month , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of China ’ s most famous AI firms , Face + .	-4.6016

Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether to change its name .	-3.3324
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to the ' Republic of North Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece , which had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-5.6890
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that its northern neighbour 's name is a territorial claim on the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.9237
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia ’ s Slavonic majority population .	-3.3464
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and , in view of a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the outcome will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-4.8624
The question on the vote was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.8023
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing to include institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.2854
“ I have come today to vote on the country ’ s future ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.5337
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will abide by the outcome of the vote , so that it becomes decisive .	-4.0889
A two-thirds majority is required in Parliament to amend the name .	-2.3127
The Land Election Committee said at 13 p.m. that there were no reports of irregularities .	-4.0739
But turnout was only 16 % – at the same time , at the last 2016 parliamentary election , the figure was 34 % , and at the end 66 % of registered voters had cast their vote .	-5.0962
“ I went to vote for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital , Skopje .	-3.3459
Macedonia 's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son Dushko have cast their vote in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the amendment of the name of the country , which would pave the way for joining NATO and the European Union in Strmica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-4.1145
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavararkov , 54 , has prepared a small stage and put chairs before the tents set up by those who are boycotting the referendum .	-4.2293
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to take up heads , not through the door of service , " said Kazakdarkov .	-3.9984
" We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.9103
If you do not want to join us as a Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.8879
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with more than 20 % unemployment .	-2.0612
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev explained after his vote .	-4.1087
According to him , the result would be ‘ yes ’ to our future .	-3.0106
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute of Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would therefore vote – less than necessary .	-3.3826
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 percent of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-3.1718
Of those who want to participate , 70 % agreed to vote in favour .	-3.2952
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout is over 50 % .	-3.1226

Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling seized Brighton ’ s defense at Manchester City2-0 on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-4.2539
Aguero gave his hit at the 65th minute incredible simple look .	-5.0776
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine male in the middle field received a passport .	-4.2898
He invented three Defenders of Brighton to be acquitted .	-3.7500
Then Agüero was surrounded by three green hills .	-2.9798
He attacked a defender before he attacked several players on the edge of the Brighton room .	-6.8756
Then he made a passport to the left and proceeded to Sterling .	-4.1440
The English striker used his first contact to play back the ball to Agüero , who then shot right – past Brighton goalkeeper Mathew Ryan in the right side of the goal .	-4.9203
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City Manager Pep Guardola to the reporters .	-3.5899
" We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.3365
That has happened .	-1.1323
Fortunately , he shot a gate at the moment . ”	-2.2849
However , it was Sterling who first led the Sky Blues at the Prime League-Duell :	-4.8243

In the game Aguero played the ball deep in the territory of Brighton .	-2.8565

Scherzer wants to play games against Rockies	-2.7423
Since the national flag had been excluded from Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-4.6851
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to be able to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still Playoff implications for the Rockies that have a lead from a game in Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-5.3268
Rockies secured at least one place ahead with a 5-2 victory over the national on Friday evening , but the winning title in the first league is still not certain .	-5.8316

The national have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to throw Scherzer in such a situation .	-4.8417

The communication for the East Labour in Nottingham on Friday states : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-7.7529
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meeting on Friday evening was exactly that .	-4.7154
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a more " more friendly , more repressive " policy has long been forgotten if it ever started .	-5.6664
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and each opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to party leaders .	-4.0791
This began shortly after Jeremys took office , because my colleagues , with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude , expected me to turn around and take positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-6.7669
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – there is a Tirade of abuse in the social media , which calls for the rejection of the Centre ’ s policy and tells me I should not be in the Labour Party .	-5.6944
This experience was not just my experience .	-3.3580
I do know , in fact , that I am more fortunate than some of my colleagues , because the comments addressed to me tend to be political .	-4.2656
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are exposed every day to a flood of sexist or racist abuse , but never shy away .	-3.1611
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the level of abuse has normalized .	-1.9115
Jeremy Corbyn argued last week that Labour should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.8739
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with any motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules , the party will become smaller .	-4.7663
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to pull my neck out , not to be so loud , and then I would be “ right . ”	-6.0138
But for this reason , I have not entered politics .	-3.5420
32 years ago , as a student , because of the neglect of the Thatcher government , Labour , I joined my school because of the neglect of the Thatcherite government , which meant that my classroom had literally collapsed , so I tried to commit myself to better public services for those who need them most , whether as a local council or minister .	-8.7784

As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.1973
To those who supported the motion on Friday , I would just like to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to stay loyal to me and the Labour Party if the country is heading for a Brexit that is detrimental to households , businesses and our public services .	-5.5001
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham 's momentum , but about my constituents , whether Labour Members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not be holding threats to opt-out or political opportunities from work in what I believe is the best interest of all of you .	-6.8794

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr unprotected top	-3.1533
Two late tries may have distorted the final result , but there is no doubt that Ayr has deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennant ’ s Premier Match of the Day .	-5.0161
They are now running the table as the only unhealthy ten teams .	-3.2586
In the end , it was the outstanding defense of the host , but also the fact that it was better to use opportunities .	-8.1908
" We have been tested so far through our games , and we are still unhealthy , so I have to be happy , " he said .	-3.4018
Robyn Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ”	-2.6885
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt in the 14th minute , passed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warrior , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Bagon got an unaltered attempt .	-6.1132
Climo prepared the lead of Ayr with a punitive collision before he directly scored a match for the midterm , and then made a soloversuch with which he succeeded in the 17 : 5 guidance for Ayr .	-10.0082
Melrose , however , began the second half of his career , and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform Baggot reduced the lag to five points .	-5.5876
After the reboot , Ayr built up the leadership as a rule of Stafford McDowall-by Climo .	-6.8384
Ayr 's current captain , Blair Macpherson , then got the yellow card , and again Melrose caused Melrose to pay the extra man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt to end a bout of intense pressure .	-7.2713
However , the home side came back , and when Stran Hutchinson received a yellow card due to a crackling without ball from Climo , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr in the back .	-5.6349

Throughout the trapped Bolivia , the memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive , as is the desire to travel back to the Pacific .	-5.2256
These hopes may have been at their peak in decades , as Bolivia is awaiting a judgment from the International Court of Justice on 1 October after five years of talks .	-4.3257
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and serenity and naturally expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.3043
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country , and hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will find Bolivia 's preferred claim that Chile must negotiate after decades of restless talks to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-5.0558
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic Indian president – who faces a controversial re-election battle next year – also depends very much on Monday ’ s decision .	-4.4336
“ We are on the verge of regaining access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he vowed at the end of August .	-3.4535
But some analysts believe that the court is unlikely to vote in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not change .	-4.4135
The UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.7111
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-4.2914
Far from advancing Bolivia ’ s cause , the past four years may have left it behind .	-4.4883
“ The question of sea access is being used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes , ” said Zárate .	-3.1922
Morales belligerent rhetoric destroyed every remaining Chilean goodwill , she proposed .	-3.0121

He spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday .	-1.8913
He urged the United States to honour the promises made during a summit of both rival leaders in Singapore .	-2.3859
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume the diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament that have been held on hold three months after the meeting with the North Korean dictator , Kim Jong-un , in Singapore .	-3.8382
Ri argues that it is “ a pipe dream ” that sanctions will continue to be imposed and the US ’ s opposition to a statement ending the Korean war will ever bring the North to its knees .	-5.1467
Washington will not agree with the statement that Pyongyang has taken comprehensive disarmament measures .	-4.7015
Both Kim and the US want President Donald Trump to have a second summit .	-2.1395

Independent schools in Scotland have a record of top academic excellence , which continued in 2018 with excellent results of examination , including single and group success in sport , art , music and other community activities .	-6.6481
With more than 30,000 students throughout Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , are striving to offer their students and parents the best service level .	-6.0275
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for secondary education , including universities , for their desired careers and for their role as world citizens .	-5.7569
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailored school curriculum , where we note that modern languages remain popular and desirable in schools .	-5.2102
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ If you speak to a person who understands him , you will reach his mind . ”	-4.4190
When you speak with him in his own language , he goes to his heart . ”	-3.2637
This impressively demonstrates that we cannot rely only on the English language if we are to build relations and trust with people from other countries .	-3.5418
The audit results of this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest ranking in independent schools .	-4.3671
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called Higher degrees A higher class A .	-5.7555
The data collected by SCIS ’ s 74 member schools showed that 72 % of students reached a “ high grade A ” in Mandarin , while at the pupils who learned German , French and Spanish , the grade A reached 72 , 69 , and 63 respectively .	-6.2354
This shows that independent schools in Scotland will promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-3.8920
In independent schools and elsewhere , language subjects have the same status as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-4.5161
A 2014 UK Commission survey on employment and qualifications found that 17 % of the causes that employers have had difficulty occupying jobs are attributable to a lack of linguistic knowledge .	-5.8752
Therefore , language proficiency is becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-4.3010
Given the increased employment opportunities that languages require , these skills are essential in a globalised world .	-3.6392
Regardless of the career that someone chooses when he has learned a second language , he will have a real advantage in the future with a lifetime ability like this .	-3.9216
The ability to communicate directly with people from abroad will automatically lead to competitors .	-4.1310
According to a YouGov survey , with more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to talk , and French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.9338
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important to today 's children .	-3.2705
When children learn to speak multiple languages – especially those of developing countries – they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the labour market later .	-4.3010
The schools in Scotland are different in terms of their language offer .	-3.7706
Some schools focus on the classical modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese , will teach .	-4.1434
Whatever your child is interested , there will always be a number of languages available in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-3.9285
Independent schools in Scotland want to offer a learning environment that is well prepared for children , to maintain the necessary equipment for their success whatever the future may bring .	-5.3552
In the contemporary global business world , languages remain undeniably important for the country ’ s future , and that must also be reflected in education .	-3.7523
Indeed , modern languages should really be viewed as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.6938

It is the first of five planned election events next week , and on his tour , Trump also visited the republican states Tennessee and Mississippi .	-6.1768
While his candidate ’ s confirmation of the vaunted Supreme Court position is pending , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , otherwise fear that Republicans will lose congressional majority if elected in November .	-5.3042

Trump ’ s rally in Wheeling , West Virginia is scheduled for 19 : 00 .	-3.6016
You can track down Trump ’ s West Virginia Rally online via live stream on YouTube .	-3.1690
Trump will certainly respond to this week ’ s hearings on charges of sexual abuse against his candidate for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose Senate endorsement was postponed by at least a week until the FBI ’ s conclusion .	-7.0204
But the main aim of these electoral events is to mobilize the Republicans facing a crucial election in November .	-4.0691
According to Reuters , the goal of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five electoral meetings next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-4.3400
“ The majority in Congress is on the president ’ s agenda , so he visits as many states as possible just before the start of the turbulent campaign season , ” said a Trump campaign spokesman , who does not want to be named , Reuters .	-4.6160
According to the radio network West Virginia MetroNews , the polling station at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania this evening and attract the attention of the Pittsburg media .	-4.1798
On Saturday , Trump will visit West Virgin , the state that he won with more than 40 % in 2016 , for the second time this month .	-2.2987
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the West Virginia Senate , Patrick Morrisey , who is lagging behind in polls .	-2.8591
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , Politologist at the University of West Virginia , said that it was not a good sign for Morrisey that the president should come to improve his poll values .	-3.6471
Ryder Cup 2018 : The US team is ready to fight to keep the hope of Sunday Games alive .	-4.8208
After three one-sided encounters , the four-person games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-4.1728
The swing swing pendulum is a freely acquired sports concept that players have interned , especially in competitions like this .	-4.4843
So where would they say the momentum is now ?	-2.0158
“ They had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so it is a bit of swing , ” Jordan Spieth said , when he moved back for the day . ”	-6.2941
Of course , Europe is in favour of a margin of 4 points and twelve more are to be played .	-6.1499
But Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails , and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day , each with three of four points .	-6.1848
Spieth was superior from the very beginning , setting a good example .	-4.8560
These awesome jubilee rings were louder than his round went on , he won a decisive coup to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas left 2 points after 2 games .	-9.6641
His joy at the putt on the 15th hole with which they won the game was so that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-4.3704
" You really have to focus on you and only worry about your own game , " Spith said .	-5.0626
This is all that remains for each of these players .	-3.5237
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.3063
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spies and Thomas .	-4.5384
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable pair playing error and just doing everything right .	-4.6525
" Moliwood " was the only pair that did not reach a Bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning on the back .	-5.0286
This course and the way in which their energy seems to flow and from this captured spectator makes them the favorites on Sunday and if the sun goes down over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who sealed a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-7.3181
They are probably both on different holes at .	-3.4938
Talking about a European victory would be too hasty .	-2.4934
Bubbba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.8725
With a Bogey and two Doubles on the first nine Spaniards and the Swede entered a hole from which they never came back .	-5.2142
On Sunday there is no one to help you out of your hole .	-2.9596
Because of the interactions between the Pairs , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change in the blink of the eye , it is very fascinating to see the Fourballs and Fourmis from close proximity .	-7.8163
Europe has played a better role as a team , taking on a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome-session has also shown that the team USA has the desire to fight , which some , especially Stateside , have questioned .	-7.5493
Europe holds 10-6 at the Ryder Cup Finaltag .	-3.3412
Europe will have a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , following the emergence of the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-5.2692
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to bring their previous record in the Le Golf National to four points .	-4.6770
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who was responsible for the preservation of the trophy that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated an American team that had replaced the squadron , and won the series with 3-1 .	-6.9263
The US offered more resistance in the squares and won two games , but it could not dither the deficit .	-2.9857
Jim Furyk 's team needs eight points from Sunday 's 12 solo games to keep the trophy .	-4.1063
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Mollwood " , are only the second couple who wins four points from their first four games in the Ryder Cup history .	-4.1418
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was certain that they would strike a soiled Woods and the American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau with an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-4.9353
Woods , who ran through two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 matches in 4-cases and fours , and seven in succession .	-5.2440
Justin Rose , rested for the Four-Lives , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Fournies and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-6.1729
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.8303
The three major stars Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for Americans on Saturday .	-4.6812
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spanish Jon Rahm and Ian Poulier in 4-pack and later returned to beating Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in 4-pack after they lost the first two holes .	-4.8127
Just twice in the Ryder Cup story , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Holder Furyk 's page only needs a draw to keep the trophy .	-5.5635
After two days of second order , however , a Sunday counter looks as though it would go beyond it .	-3.8883
North Korea says that there will be “ in no way ” unilateral disarmament without trust .	-6.1647
On Saturday , North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations that the continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that it would not , under such circumstances , unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons .	-4.0871
Ri Yong Ho said last year ’ s annual General Assembly that North Korea adopted “ significant goodwill measures , ” such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear testing branch , and the commitment not to spread nuclear weapons and technology .	-6.6452
" But there is no response from the US , " he said .	-3.1482
“ Without any trust in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we can disarm unilaterally first . ”	-4.3544
As the Shi 'a retracted the familiar North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , which would reward North Korea with gradual steps , his explanation seemed significant in that it did not entirely oppose unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-5.9499
He referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US president and a North Korean leader on 12 June in Singapore , when Kim committed to working for a “ denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , ” while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-4.8205
North Korea has sought a formal end to the Korean war of 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-2.8821
Washington also resisted calls for a relaxation of the severe international sanctions against North Korea .	-3.0717
The US insists on " denuclearization first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , and even reject the " declaration of the end of war " , said Ri .	-4.2931
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a pipe dream for people who are ignorant of us .	-2.9768
But the problem is that continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust . ”	-3.6508
He did not mention any plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US president emphasized at the United Nations earlier this week .	-3.5673
The minister instead raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in the past five months , and added : " If the party were South Korea and not the US on this issue of denuclearization , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not end up in such a dead end " .	-5.7026
Yet the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. The General Assembly that targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump called “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-6.1431
This year , at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ completely destroy ” North Korea last year , has praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work has yet to be done , and sanctions must remain in place until North Korea has reduced denuclearization .	-5.5691
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no time to do so , saying : ' It doesn ’ t matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months ' .	-3.9039
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.6065
However , in the United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN Security Council on Thursday that ' the enforcement of the sanctions of the Security Council must be vigorous and without a shortfall until we achieve the full , definitive and verified denuclearization ' .	-6.2374
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the financing of Pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-3.4825
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said that he will return to Pyongyang to prepare for a second summit .	-4.0390
Pompeo visited North Korea on three occasions this year , but his last trip was not a good one .	-2.2147
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made , and only a few hours after that , North Korea condemned him for making “ pro-like demands . ”	-6.2257
This month , at a meeting with Moon , North Korea pledged to dismantle a missile base and also a nuclear complex when the United States is ' taking appropriate action ' .	-5.2671
He said Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalise relations with Washington .	-4.2630
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough rest .	-2.5472
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight the growing macho culture of study of “ spent nights ” .	-4.8761
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.4571
Charles Czariler , professor of sleep medicine at Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he considered to be the first of his kind in the US .	-3.6514
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture on the impact of a lack of sleep on learning .	-3.8490
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is it only now , in my final year , told me ?	-4.0150
She said that you never told someone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he said to the Telegraph .	-4.1998
The course , which is being offered for the first time this year , explains to students the basics of how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general wellbeing .	-4.6457
Paul Barreira , professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Director of Health at the University , said that the university had decided to introduce the course after having found that the students had been in extreme deprivation during the week .	-6.1682
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.8490
In a section there is an image of a sleep saal where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how sporting performance is affected by a lack of sleep and the importance of a sleep routine .	-6.4546
Another section explains how long-term sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attacks , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-4.7485
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-2.0694
We know that it will not change the behavior of students immediately .	-2.1698
" But we believe that they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czariler .	-3.7021
The culture of pride still exists , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students make sleeping deprivation a growing problem .	-2.8992
Enough sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also to not accept , as sleep deprivation puts the brain in Hungarian-mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-5.6598
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , Professor Czariler helped shape the course after attending one of his classes last year at Harvard .	-3.6452
He said that the course had opened his eyes and encouraged him to take a campuswide course .	-3.1622
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all the Dokotorkans to complete a similar study programme before entering the University of Competition .	-5.1965
Prof. Czariler recommended to students to provide an alert when they should go into bed and when they should wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can cause their circular rhythm to get out of time , which leads to problems when asleep .	-8.1261
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal erated Gerrard Men	-3.0614
Further down problems of Rangers : After a match of Dolly Menga , the 1-to-0-win win win for the team of Steven Gerrard came in Livingston .	-6.1707
The team of Gary Holt , however , added Gerrard 's second defeat in 18 games as a trainer , who left his team by eight points behind the disappointed Ladbrokes Prime Minister Hearts .	-5.4959
Menga landed a match seven minutes before the midterm , and an inspiring league layout did not look as if it could bring a balance .	-7.0094
While the Rangers now fall back to the sixth place , Livingston climb to rank three and are just behind Hibernian for the Tordifference .	-5.9298
New difficulties for the Rangers are emerging , as scheduled judges Calum Spence had to supply a headscarf after being hit by a litter item – apparently thrown out of the downward fans sector .	-7.5404
Gerrard made eight bills to the side that went by Ayr and swept directly into the semi-finals of the Betguincup .	-4.3806
Holt , on the other hand , unveiled the same Livi-Elf , who took a point off the Hearts last week , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his highly trained team did not allow the opponents to take action at any time .	-8.5633
Although the Rangers dominated the ball ownership , Livingston did better off chances .	-6.1473
You should have met after only two minutes , when Mengas first client Scott Pittman sent to the Allan McGregors Tor , but the midfield player left his great change at the gate .	-6.3501
A deeper acquittal of Keaghan Jacobs then went to captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgov could only shoot a long way towards the rear post .	-5.5655
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than obscurantism in their own game , the last third .	-3.1303
After the end of the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly believed to have earned a penalty point after he and Steven Lawless clashed , but referee Steven Thomson did not heed the calls of the Colombian player .	-7.7525
The Rangers get only two shots in the first half , but the former Iblx Torhguard Liam Kelly was hardly able to take away from Lassada Coulibalys 's head and find a bisslose Ovie Ejaria .	-7.2930
Although Livis ’ s opening meeting may have been contrary to the game ’ s running in the 34th minute , no one can deny that they have earned it alone for their efforts .	-7.2962
Again , the Rangers failed to master a Jacobs default situation .	-2.9969
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the rest and took Menga out for a simple finish .	-3.6255
Gerrard acted during the interval when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the rival player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-5.2557
But Livingstone has always moved guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgov and Halkett throwing long balls after long balls .	-4.8569
Holt 's team could have further extended its leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up well to refuse Jacobs before leaving the corner .	-6.8728
The Rangers ' representative Glenn Middleton had another belated claim to a penalty because he was hiding with Jacobs , but once again he looked like Thomson .	-6.0580
Almanach : the inventor of the violinist counter	-2.3556
And now a page from our Almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , named Hans , Geiger , was born in Germany .	-4.5667
Geiger developed a method for recognizing and measuring radioactivity , an invention that finally produced the device known as the Geiger counter .	-9.0557
The Geiger counter has since also become a Mainstay of Science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , the seemingly unlikely cowhand scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-4.4719
Man : " What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.2979
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.6686
When you shoot these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals . ”	-5.1861
Evans : “ Tell me , but it ’ s now big ! ”	-4.5681
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 6th birthday .	-2.5829
But the invention that bears its name will continue to be used .	-2.5462
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malicious cells .	-2.0705
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malicious cells .	-2.4075
vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malign cells as part of treatment .	-2.5811
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , modification of them in the laboratory .	-3.0976
You can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-injected .	-2.8656
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-3.0454
A woman treated with the vaccine that accompanies the immune system to detect rogue cells saw their egg cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-3.5645
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many types of cancer , and then re-injected the cells .	-4.5749
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . '	-2.4020
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer ” , including breast , egg , lung and intestinal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.7431
A similar approach to take patients from immune cells and teach them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treatment of a type of leukaemia .	-4.0972
After his performance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with Magna cap , left a pro-Trump tirade of the stack .	-4.4637
It did not go well .	-5.8683
Kanye West was caught up in the studio during a Saturday Night Live broadcast after a speech in which he praised the US , and said that he will play in 2020 .	-6.3951
After having performed his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while wearing a Big America cap , he held against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-5.4202
" As often do I speak with a white person and she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-3.6536
Now , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America long ago , " he said .	-3.3846
The Saturn Night-Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon , on Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee concerning Christine Blasey Ford ’ s allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually forced them to funny .	-6.0612
Although it was not broadcast , West 's story was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in social media .	-5.3413
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the contribution .	-3.1673
West also complained to the audience that he had had had a hard time behind the stage , because of his headdress .	-3.7228
" You shied me behind the stage .	-3.6025
They said : ' Do not go with the hat out ' .	-3.9460
You have annoyed me !	-2.3357
And then they say that I am in a occupied place , " he said , according to Washington Examiner .	-2.7248
West continued : " Want to see the lost place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman cloak because that means you cannot tell me what I want to do .	-7.4492
Try it with love . ”	-0.9757
His comments were directed at at least twice by the audience and the comedians of Saturday Night Live appeared to be moved , Variety reported and quoted a person in the words : “ The whole studio was dead . ”	-6.6600
West was later replaced by singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-3.1346
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " when Perrier Bottle dressed .	-3.6836
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who got mixed : “ This is for one of the most courageous spirits : THANK YOU that DU DICH THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAS ” .	-6.3191
But Talkmasterin Karen Hunter twitted that West is simply " that is what he is , and this is absolutely wonderful " .	-4.7844
“ But I will reward no one ( by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , of which I believe he accepts and divulges an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-4.4245
It is free .	-0.9663

On Saturday , US MEP Maxime Waters rejected claims that one of her employees should have published personal data from three Republican US senators on the Wikipedia pages .	-5.8193
The Los Angeles based democrat believes that the claims of members of the ultra-left wing and websites have been launched .	-6.6633
“ lies , lies , and even more repulsive lies , ” he told Waters on Twitter in an commentary .	-4.5354
Information published has reportedly included the private addresses and phone numbers of US Senator Lindsey Graham from South Carolina , as well as the US Senators Mike Lee and Orrin Hatch , both from Utah .	-4.2440
The information appeared on Thursday online , posted by an unknown person at the Capitol Hill during a hearing of the Senate on allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court of Kavanaugh .	-4.6403
The data of the three senators was published shortly after the survey of Kavanaugh .	-1.9390
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified by the source of the posts was associated with Waters 's office and that the information provided by an employee of Waters reported Hill .	-5.5419
" This unsubstantiated charge is completely wrong and an absolute lie , " so Waters continues .	-4.5674
“ My employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – were in no way responsible for ensuring that this information was put into practice .	-5.2767
This unsubstantiated claim is entirely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.8139
Waters ’ statement quickly led to criticism online , including the former White House Press Secretary Ari Fleischer .	-4.5767
“ That the thing is denying is extremely annoying , ” said butchers .	-3.8196
“ This suggests that it is inappropriate as a member of Congress .	-2.9759
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be angry .	-2.5495
You must not be idle .	-2.7327
You must not challenge the motives of the plaintiff .	-1.7482
They need to be calm and left . ”	-2.9433
Fleischer appeared to compare Waters ’ s response with the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused of being too angry at the hearing on Thursday .	-4.8355
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who ran next to the sitless Waters in the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.1273
Big , if true , he has hit .	-3.1898
In her statement , Waters said that her office " informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities about the fraudulent claims .	-3.9624
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are captured and accountable for their actions , which have a destructive and dangerous impact on my employees , ” she continued .	-3.9043
Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.9979
It is a tradition to search for suggestions in every new film with British tendency for Brexit , and that seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy Spoying , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was inaugurated in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn .	-7.5414
Is the ironic self-satire about the humanity behind the abyss the new nation ’ s export opportunity ?	-3.6333
However , for the second time , the chimerical , gumsy and incompetent Johnny English received the license to reshuffle things .	-8.4880
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre demands on smoothie glamour , received a little clouseau , a syringe Mr. Bean and a kick from this guy and who has added a note to the guides melodie of the firecars at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-7.6898
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once worked in the ever-forgotten Barclays TV shows , who are still running into chaos .	-6.8805
There are one or two beautiful moments in this newest Johnny English bedroom .	-4.1008
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and beats the main rotor shortly against his helmet .	-4.0720
Atkinson 's talent for body comedies is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially as the " serious " film stores like 007 and Mission Impossible self-consciously offer comedy as a ingredient .	-6.4319
The humor feels as if it is directed to children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkins Mr. Bean ’ s films .	-5.8357
The perennial premise is now that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.5646
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the British intelligence network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to close the service agent , a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-4.9521
It is the last straw for a Prime Minister who is a pompous and contended personality and is already experiencing a complete fusion of political unpopularity .	-5.0445
Your intelligence advisor will inform you that , since every single active spy has been compromised , she has to take someone out of retirement .	-4.8994
And that means , the great pathy Johnny English itself , which is currently employed as a school master in a noble institution , but gives unprecedented lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy about espionage .	-8.2120
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency war , and is reunified with its former , long-suffering combel Bough , again played by Ben Miller .	-6.3910
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an overtired , burchief role , in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully applicable .	-5.9562
So the batman and Robin of chaos at the Secret Service of her Majesty are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenas ’ s beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.9547
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously caught in the lurch of the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-5.0623
English and Bough start their odyssey of the colorful Highjinks : as waiters dressed , they inflame a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling luxury yacht on board Volta 's luxury yacht ; and English is triggering anarchy when he tries to familiarise himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas house .	-7.8209
I am sure that all the registers have been drawn for this last sequence , but it is so amiable and lacking , it reminds us of child television .	-7.5394
It is quite .	-2.5014
And , as with other Johnny England movies , I could not fail to think : can the British film industry , Rowan Atkinson , play a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-5.6739
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week week , for which five days are paid .	-3.4693
Jeremy Corbyns ’ Labour Party is considering a radical plan in which Britons work only four days a week , but are paid for five .	-3.7074
According to reports , the party wants heads of companies to pass on the savings made by the artificial intelligence revolution to workers by giving them an additional day .	-4.1265
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.2954
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plans to topple the country for the benefit of workers .	-4.5752
The trade union congress approved the transition to a four-day week week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-4.6579
A high-ranking source from the Labour Party said the Sunday : policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.8514
A four-day week week is an objective that is in line with the party 's approach to restoring economic balance in favour of workers and the party 's general industrial strategy , but this objective will not be achieved overnight .	-6.1568
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its campaign in 2017 .	-2.4227
However , that push is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party .	-3.7718
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not party politics and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.9149
Counsel John McDonnell used the Labour Party conference last week to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.7829
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit-makers ' in utilities .	-2.3411
The Shadow Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of the water companies may not receive their full share , as a Labour government could “ cut off ” on the grounds of alleged wrongdoing .	-6.5906
He also confirmed the plans to recruit employees into the enterprise lines and to create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of the capital of private sector companies to employees receiving annual dividends of up to GBP 500 .	-5.2170
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 Minutes ” about whether FBI-rds against Kavanaugh might change their mind .	-5.6448
An ongoing FBI investigation into charges against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote to appeal to the Supreme Court by at least a week , and raises the question of whether the Federal republican senators ’ findings could lead to abandoning their support for Kavanaugh .	-6.1803
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , a correspondent of “ 60 Minutes , ” the Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham , asked whether the FBI ’ s investigative findings could persuade them to change their mind .	-5.3064
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-2.6753
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.8574
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-2.0479
I called him after that happened after that claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-4.3313
He was determined , determined , unequivocal . '	-2.4980
Graham 's voice , however , appeared to be cast in stone .	-2.3992
" I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb attack , " he said .	-3.3913
“ Dr Ford , I don ’ t know what happened , but I know that Brett strongly challenged the accusation , ” Graham added a hint to Christine Blasey Ford .	-5.2456
" No one they called could confirm it .	-3.3063
It has been 36 years ago .	-1.6087
I see nothing new that is changing . '	-2.7336
" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has ensured that poverty is reduced ? "	-2.5533
On this Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.5440
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring tens of thousands of people together at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the real goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.6995
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an expansion of Global Poverty Projects , an international interest group aimed at fighting poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against these .	-4.2754
In order to receive a free ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteer work , an email to a leader in the world , a telephone call or another meaningful way of increasing the goal of poverty reduction and raising awareness of it .	-6.2926
But how successful has Global Cities been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-3.1427
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of what is called ' Clicktivism ' - people who feel like sending a tweet by signing an online petition or an online application , or by sending a tweet , would they make a real difference ?	-5.2301
Global Cities say that it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” by its supporters since 2011 , pushing for a variety of goals .	-3.5387
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-3.7641
In early 2018 , the Group launched 390 stakes and advisories from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid or financed .	-5.3175
The group estimates that the funds allocated have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.4744
One of the key commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations that has committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential , ” the organization has promised to help Rwanda , with $ 35 million , end the country ’ s malnutrition after Global Citizens have received more than 4,700 tweets .	-6.9741
“ With support from the British Government , donors , other state governments , and global citizens like you , we can cause the social injustice of malnutrition to be history one day , ” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.7069
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom aimed at improving maternal and child nutrition , the government will achieve the financing of the Power of Nutrition project of 5 million women and children with nutritional interventions .	-4.4310
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website : “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.8642
Globalists responded : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-3.7185
Like the great civil law and the anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed because we are more powerful together .	-3.0048
The stars Janet Jackson , Weknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will be present at this year 's New York event , which is moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-7.6437
US Navy agencies could establish a “ blockade ” to hinder Russian energy exports – Home Secretary .	-4.4692
Washington can use its navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-3.5991
Zinke argued that Russia ’ s involvement in Syria – especially in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.6655
“ I think the reason they are in the Middle East is as follows : they want to negotiate energy as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.9396
And , according to officials , there are ways and means to get round it .	-4.2647
" The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that sea routes are open and , if necessary , to block them in order to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-5.0029
Zinke spoke to participants in an Consumer Energy Alliance event , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.6974
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , and found that they are indeed the same .	-2.8551
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while describing Russia as a " one-Trick Duck " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-4.2164
The opinions come when the Trump administration was on the mission to boost exports of its liquefied natural gas to Europe , and to replace Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-4.8375
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to persuade Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would turn Berlin into Moscow ’ s “ prisoner . ”	-3.7137
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the USD 11 billion pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which aims to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-3.1282
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons , and that it is an example of unfair competition .	-3.0035
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument for exerting pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russia ’ s energy minister , Aleksandr Novak , in Moscow , after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in September .	-3.6478
The US position has provoked a backlash from Germany that has reaffirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.9561
Germany ’ s leading industrial organisation , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has invited the US to refrain from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.2546
" I have a major problem when a third state enters our energy supply , " said the Federal Association of German Industry ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-3.1527
Elizabeth Warren Will Take " Hard Look " At Running For President in 2020 , Massachusetts Senator Says	-1.6622
Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren said on Saturday that she would seriously consider the presidential candidacy after the mid-term election .	-2.3529
During a Council meeting in Holyoke , Massachusetts , Warren confirmed that she would consider running .	-1.6676
" It is time for women to go to Washington to repair our broken government , and that includes a woman at the top , " she said , according to The Hill .	-2.2583
After 6 November , I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy .	-2.5580
President Donald Trump urged Warren during the House meeting and said that he would lead ' this country in the wrong direction ' .	-6.2359
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.8179
Warren ’ s criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court , candidate Brett Kavanaugh , has not minced her hand .	-5.2814
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-2.5389
However , a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters did not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-3.6410
According to a study by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 percent of " likely " Massettis-voters said that the senator should not run .	-4.3522
Thirty-two percent supported such a course .	-2.3570
The survey showed more support for a run by former Governor Deval Patrick , with 38 % for a potential run and 48 % against .	-3.3931
Other high-profile democrats that are being discussed with a view to a possible candidacy in 2020 are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders .	-4.5930
The Associated Press reported that Biden would officially decide by January .	-1.7699
Sarah Palin cites Track Palin ’ s PTSD by Donald Trump ’ s campaign	-2.1861
Track Palin , 26 , spending one year in Iraq after being convened in September .	-2.2882
He was arrested and accused of alleged domestic violence on Monday evening .	-1.9600
“ In the light of what my own son passes through what he is doing just after he has returned , I can understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries that our soldiers are returning to understand , ” she told the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa , Oklahoma .	-5.6696
Palin described his arrest as “ the elephant in the room ” and said about her son and other veterans : “ They come back a little differently , they come back harder and wonder whether the work of her co-soldiers and the air force and all other members of the military is respected for the country . ”	-7.0047
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla , Alaska , and charged with domestic acts of violence against a woman , an abuse of domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a dishonorable state , says Dan Bennett , a spokesperson for the police of Wasilla .	-6.0354
18 States D. C. support the challenge of a new asylum policy	-3.0251
18 states and Washington , DC support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-3.6228
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district in Washington on Friday submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Frind of the Court ) to help asylum seekers challenge the law .	-4.9189
The full name of the plaintiff in the litigation of Grace against sessions filed against the Federal Law in August by the American Civil Liberties Union .	-4.0749
She said that her partner had " and his violent sons of gang members " abused them , but on July 20 US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-3.8104
She was arrested in Texas .	-1.2225
The state lawyers supporting Grace , known as El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which comprise a large number of US asylum seekers , are nations that are struggling with deep problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-6.1286
The US ’ s new asylum policy has overturned a decision by the 2014 complaints panel to allow undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence to apply for asylum .	-4.0017
The Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-3.2350
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all applications for asylum must be judged in accordance with the circumstances of the respective complaint and such an action violates this principle .	-5.7185
Lawyers continued to argue that the policy that denies immigrants to enter the US economy is damaging because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “ do the job they need . ”	-4.9120
Attorney General Jeff Session has instructed immigrant magistrates in June not to grant asylum to persons fleeing from domestic or gang backgrounds .	-5.6706
“ Asylum is available to those who have to leave their home country for persecution on the grounds of race , religion , nationality , or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion , ” said sessions in his statement on the law on 11 June .	-5.9202
Asylum has never been designed to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones that people face every day around the world .	-3.1901

US ambassador accuses China of “ bullying ” with “ propaganda propaganda . ”	-2.3894
A week after an official Chinese newspaper issued a four-page display in a US daily newspaper on the mutual benefit of US trade in China , the US ambassador in Beijing accused the US press of using propaganda .	-5.1834
Last Wednesday , US President Donald Trump referred to the China Daily ’ s paid allowance in the Des Moines register - the state with the most sold off off Iowa newspaper - after accusing China of meddling in the US Congress elections of 6 November , which China denies .	-6.8266
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation that Beijing tried to interfere in the US election is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.4511
While it is normal for foreign states to turn ads to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.9185
At an early stage of trade war , China ’ s retaliation by Chinese and US experts suggests that exporters in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-4.0328
Terry Branstad , the United States ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa , a significant exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing has hurt American workers , farmers and businesses .	-3.9201
In an article in the Moines register on Sunday , China , Branstad , “ is now firmly engaged with propaganda in our own free press .	-6.1501
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government is exploiting the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom , ” said Branstad .	-4.4436
" By contrast , you will find only limited dissenting voices in the Beijing streets at the newsstand , and will not see any real rebuke of differences of opinion that the Chinese people might have for China ’ s disturbing economic development , given that the media are firmly in the grip of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-7.2970
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers resisted the publication offer , " although he did not say which newspaper .	-4.2167
The Republicans scream against the Midterm-Elections with the Kavanaugh debacle ; Analysts	-5.3062
Many of the Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assault , warning analysts that they will see a counterstrike in the forthcoming elections , particularly by women .	-6.2651
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for it .	-2.8547
These things cannot be traced , Grant Reeher , professor of political science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , said on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-4.2664
Reeher said that he doubts that the last-minute support of Jeff Flake ( Republican MEP for the Arizona State ) was enough to reconcile anger with the FBI .	-6.8223
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November , ” says Karin Jean-Pierre , senior advisor and national spokeswoman for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-4.1365
On Friday morning , the protesters sung “ November comes ! ” while demonstrating in the Senate ’ s hall when the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination despite the statement by Dr Christine Blasey Ford , Mic reported .	-5.3338
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , journalists .	-2.0961
" People say that it is quite advanced , that is true .	-3.8179
But the figure could be higher , especially among the voters in the suburbs and younger , 18-29 , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-5.6990
Already before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she made allegations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts said that a backlash could follow if Republicans put forward the bid .	-6.6170
“ For the GOP , this has become a dirty mess , ” said Michael Steele , former Chairman of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , according to NBC News .	-3.9113
“ It is not simply a question of the committee election or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is placed on the replacement bank ; it is a question of how the Republicans have done this and how they have dealt with it , ” stated Guy Cecil , director of the US priorities , a group that helps select the Democrats , with the news channel .	-8.4509
But Americans are divided by Ford and Kavanaugh .	-2.0039
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of respondents Ford 's testimony was definitely or probably believed , while 35 percent claim that they believed definitively or probably Kavanaugh .	-8.1194
Moreover , 38 % said they thought that Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said the same thing about Ford .	-4.0348
On the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and another prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.8932
Ford said last week in front of the Senate Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had assaulted them at the age of 17 .	-6.0290
Ramirez accuses one of the highest judges of the state , having exposed his genitals in front of her during her studies in Yale in the 1980s .	-6.1955
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook .	-2.3182
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , establishes a start-up company to compete with Facebook , Amazon , and Google .	-2.5699
The current project of the technology legend , Inett , is a company that builds on the open source platform “ Solid ” by Berners-Lee .	-4.0851
With Solid , users can define where their data is stored and which persons may have access to what information .	-4.6765
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee quipped that the aim of Inett is to take over world domination .	-4.1276
“ We must do it now , ” he said about the startup .	-2.6221
“ It is an historic moment . ”	-1.2813
The app uses the Solid technology that allows users to create their own personal online data storage or a POD .	-6.0250
Data storage can include contact lists , tasks lists , calendar , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-3.0428
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Sleck and Spotify all available on a browser and all at the same time .	-2.5467
The special thing about the personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to decide which type of information is possible .	-5.1029
The company calls it “ enabling people through data . ”	-2.7430
According to John Bruce ’ s CEO , Inrupt will provide resources , processes and know-how to make Solid accessible to a broad audience .	-4.2695
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some staff involved in the project and a community of voluntary programmers .	-5.1310
From this week , technology developers can create their own decentralised apps worldwide using the tools available on the Inrupt website .	-4.0271
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor he himself will talk to Facebook and Google about the major changes that will put all previous business models on the head overnight .	-4.1392
“ We will not ask for permission . ”	-2.8011

Desperate Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-3.5398
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling of being amused by his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to be a success .	-10.2138
The 24-year-old said that he became aware only at the secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.3570
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs on Radio 4 , by Lauren Laverne , he said he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.6988
He also said that a victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.1724
The regular presentation of Kristy Young , who has been running for a long time , has been released for several months due to a disease .	-4.3360
Daley joined Lavernes ’ first program , saying that he felt “ less worthy ” than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-5.0864
He said , “ Until today , these feelings of Weniger Wert and otherness have given me the strength and strength to be successful . ”	-4.9538

My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.9792
His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 only 40 years after a cancer diagnosis .	-3.7442
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets for London 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-2.9119

The formative Mickelson was on the Ryder Cup-Saturday at the Bank .	-5.1975
American Phil Mickelson will record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup-game , but he has to dramatically improve his form so that he won 't be a sadder milestone .	-9.7285
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bench by Captain Jim Furyk for the fourballs and Fournies on Saturday .	-4.1412
Instead , as is often the case for the US , the five-fold victor split his day between fire and feigning rounds on the golf course , hoping to overcome his deep .	-6.3775
The 48-year-old is never the most straight driver even at the height of his career , and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where long Rough regularly punishes .	-5.8936
And as if the place alone was not challenging enough , Mickelson met in the ninth match on Sunday at the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-5.7170
If Americans lost four points at the start of the 12 individual games and got a hot start , Mickelsons ’ match could be absolutely decisive .	-5.5451
Furyk expressed his confidence in his man ; what else would he have left .	-4.9264
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clamps and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-4.3147
“ He has a lot of confidence .	-2.3571
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much in the past for these teams , and this week .	-2.0235
I would probably not have thought he was playing two games .	-2.8779
I had hoped for more , but it was the way in which we thought we had to tackle it .	-6.2742
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.6562
So far , Nick Faldo has the record of most played matches at the Ryder Cup , which will break Mickelson on Sunday .	-5.2508

He was the first to win the tournament , but he was also the first to win the tournament .	-14.4103
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , witty , he loves to talk people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.6931

It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.1472
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.0051
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the individual games of the last day at the Ryder Cup can quickly become an uncomfortable Ritt .	-4.2303
In 1997 , the Dane debuted in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only barely reached the finishing line and won 13 <unk> with a terribly thin margin of 14 <unk> .	-6.2722
" It is remembered that Valderrama was in the lead ; we had a great lead in Brookline , where we lost , and in Valderrama we won , but only barely , " said Bjorn , after he was in the class of 2018 , now led by 10-6 in the Le Golf National , Friday and yesterday in a 5-3 victory .	-7.8055
The story will show me and all in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.5742
You will be absolutely bored tomorrow .	-3.2045
Get out and do the right things .	-1.4009
It is only past when the points are displayed on the table .	-3.7585
Our goal is to win this Cup , and we focus on it .	-2.8454
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-3.0981
Freunde how his players played on a hard golf course , added Björn : " I would never be fast on this .	-4.7378
Tomorrow is also another day .	-1.2772
Tomorrow are the personal performances , and that is another thing .	-2.9081
It ’ s great to be out there with a partner when things go well , but if you are out there alone , your abilities as golf players will be tested on the whole .	-5.7440
This is the message you need to send to the players : get the best out tomorrow .	-3.7349
Now you are handing over to your partner and he has to do exactly how you can . ”	-6.4873
Unlike Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to cut off individually better than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have won three out of four points . , , and .	-9.1509
Furyk himself has seen such a sensational turn at the end of the day , when he was part of Brookline ’ s winning team , now he is among the losers , after the European team finished the “ miracle of Medinah ” .	-6.1825
" I remember every word that was spoken , " he said , how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-5.5912
We have 12 major games tomorrow , but we want to get rid of them as quickly as possible , as we saw in Brookline , in Medinah .	-5.0760
Once a dynamic has developed , the pressure on the middle mat is intense .	-7.0188
We set up our position accordingly and drove the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-5.6766
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulier , should lead the other European at the top of the league , the opponent against Rory McIlroy .	-5.3684
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-3.4090
Germany ’ s new warship has again been postponed	-4.4769
The latest German Navy ferrets should have been deployed in 2014 to replace old Cold War warships , but according to erroneous systems and escalating costs , local media reports will now take at least until next year .	-7.2297
The start-up of the “ Rheinland-Pfalz ” , the flagship ship of the Baden-Württemberg brand new frigates , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , so the newspaper “ Time ” is entitled to a military spokesman .	-7.1519
The navy should have started shipping in 2014 , but serious problems following the first delivery were causing the ambitious project .	-5.0152
The four ships ordered by the Marine Corps in 2007 will replace the latter in the Bremen-class .	-5.9925
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of anti-flight and anti-ship missiles , and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-5.0087
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest ferrets should be used for up to two years without running the home port .	-4.9490
However , the ultra-modern warships that Germany is supposed to enable an overseas power project will already be outdated if they are finally put to service , as the weekly “ Time ” recalls .	-7.2702
The unfortunate F125-fergate brought headlines last year , when the German Navy officially refused to take the ship into operation , and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-6.2027
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a ship farmer after delivery .	-3.1609
Little was known about the reasons for the ship ’ s return ; German media mentioned a number of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the war ship useless in combat missions .	-4.2938
Software faults were particularly important because the ships of the Baden-Württemberg class are operated by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew of the Bremen-class older frigates .	-5.6313
It also transpired that the ship has a considerable excess weight , which would limit performance and impede future upgrades for the Navy .	-6.3329
It is assumed that the 7,000-tone “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II .	-3.4771
In addition to defective hardware , the price tag of the entire project - including crew training - is also discussed .	-5.0188
Instead of the originally budgeted EUR 2.2 billion , the costs now seem to have reached the dizzying figure of EUR 3.1 billion ( around USD 3.6 billion ) .	-4.2163
The problems of the latest ferrets are particularly important in light of recent warnings about Germany ’ s naval decline .	-5.0766
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee , admitted that the war fleet was indeed ‘ going on operational vessels ’ .	-5.6758
The official said that the problem had grown smoothly over time , as old ships were put out of service without there being a substitute for .	-5.4017
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg ’ s trade unions were served by the Navy .	-5.7083
The National Trust supports the secret lives of bats .	-2.1534
New research on a property in the Highlands of Scotland tries to find out how bats use the food search landscape .	-4.4257
It is hoped that this will provide new insights into the behavior of the unique flying mammalian that can guide future action to protect animals .	-5.8730
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will be followed by nasty and soprano pists as well as brownish langohorous and Daubenton bats in the Inverew Gardens in Western Ross .	-5.3804
Special reception units are located at main points of the accommodation to monitor the presence of Fledermauer throughout the entire season .	-5.6460
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with manual detectors .	-3.1374
A professional sound analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of bat rings and classifies the calls to the species . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . .	-6.3916
The habitat map and the report to be produced should provide a detailed overview of the behavior .	-8.1949
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out which areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by the respective species .	-4.7321
This information will help to determine the benefits of life management , such as Wiesenformation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species .	-12.7429
We have seen a sharp decline in the bats cases in Scotland and the UK as a whole over the past hundred years .	-5.7491
They are threatened by construction work affecting their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-2.8164
There is also a risk for wind turbines and lighting , as well as for dribbling and chemical treatment of building materials .	-6.8878
Fledermeuse are not , in fact , blind .	-4.5277
When it comes to their nocturnal hunting activities , the ears are more useful than the eyes when it comes .	-5.6186
They use sophisticated Echo-positioning technology to localize flaws and obstacles in their flight path .	-4.5116
The NTS , responsible for hosting more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-3.1989
There are ten trained experts who perform surveys regularly , inspect sleeping places and sometimes perform rescues .	-4.5068
The organization has even established Scotland ’ s first and only dedicated Fledermaurevat in the Three estate in Dumfries and Galloway , home to eight of the ten bat types in Scotland . , , , and , , , , and . , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.9902
According to Manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.1452
“ Here in Three , we have a great area for bats . ”	-3.2220
" We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good living space .	-2.5169
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other sites helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-4.6946
He stresses that it is important to check in buildings before maintenance work , whether bats are there , so it is possible that as a separate sleeping place of mother animals is destroyed , up to 400 females and young people may be killed , a whole will .	-8.9858
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-4.4149
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish colleague at the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-2.7026
She said , “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.5945

Cristiano Ronaldo has branded rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-2.6822
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-2.2455
Portuguese and Juventus were accused of being raped in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 by an American named Kathryn Mayorga .	-4.0329
He should have paid her $ 375,000 to keep silent about the incident , the mirror reported on Friday .	-3.7662
The hours after the allegations were reported , Ronaldo , 33 in an instant video , returned the reports to his 142 million followers as “ fake news . ”	-4.2642
No , no , no , no .	-0.8910
What they say today , fake news , ” said the five-time balloon D 'Or winner in the camera .	-3.3062
“ You want to apply for yourself by using my name .	-2.1394
" This is normal .	-1.6705
You want to draw attention when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.6114
I ’ m a happy person , and everything is good , ” added the player smiley .	-4.1159
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are making a complaint against the “ Der Spiegel ” magazine for allegations ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ illegal reporting of privacy suspicions . ”	-6.2696
Peter Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for “ intangible damage equal to the seriousness of the injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of the personality in recent years . ”	-5.3008
The alleged incident was due to arrive in a Suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.2466
According to records filed at Clark County District Court in the U.S. state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player ’ s room after getting to know in a nightclub where he .	-7.4379
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen on his knees after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” left in the lurch by the “ 1 % . ”	-4.7298
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had sex , but it was consensual .	-2.5821
Mayorga also claims that she went to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial settlement because she had " fear of retribution " and worried about being " publicly humiliated " .	-4.9412
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to declare the agreement invalid because it remains traumatised by the alleged incident .	-3.4834
Ronaldo was about to change to Real Madrid from Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and switched to a 100-million Euro deal to the Italian giant Juve this summer .	-5.5645
Brexit : Britain would forever regret losing automakers .	-1.5621
“ The United Kingdom would regret life if , after Brexit , it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer , ” said economics minister Greg Clark .	-4.4131
He added that it is ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Burnaston , near Derby , if major British were to leave the EU without a deal .	-4.6295
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.6805
Japan ’ s car manufacturer said that the impact of border delays in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.4554
The plant in Burnaston , which produces Auris and Aventis brands for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.1698
“ If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that our factory will end with production stops , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-5.7836
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the modalities of cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.1744
For example , BMW has already announced to close its work in Oxford for a month after Brexit .	-2.7486
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the case of a ' no deal Brexit ' .	-3.7959
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on specialty manufacturing , i.e. , the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for special products .	-7.7092
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays on the border , which , according to industry information , can lead to supply shortages and partial shortages .	-4.9881
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of the stock in his work in Derbyshire , said the company , and so the production would be stopped .	-3.5260
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU is “ accurately calibrated to avoid such border controls . ”	-3.6035
We need to have a deal ; we want the best deal that not only enables us to succeed , we want to seize this opportunity , ” he said the BBC Radio 4 programme Today .	-6.1025
“ The reference not only from Toyota , but also from other manufacturers is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-4.1184
Toyota did not provide evidence of how long the production ban might last , but warned that the increase in costs would , in the long run , cause the plant ’ s competitiveness and eventually lost jobs .	-6.9593
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives , and spent 24 years in Burnaston , said trade union members are increasingly worried : “ My experience is that once they have been cut , jobs are lost forever . ”	-5.3336

Trump ’ s Rosstein meeting could once again be postponed , says the White House	-3.3130
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with the deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week , ” as the battle for the Supreme Judicial candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-4.9478
Rosenstein oversees the work of the Special Advisor Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in the elections , the connections between Trump and Russia , and the president ’ s possible obstruction of justice .	-3.8127
Whether Trump will or not become the deputy Chief Prosecutor ’ s fire-fighter , and in order to endanger the independence of Müller , Washington has been dragging on for months .	-6.2039
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and make it possible to remove the president from the 25th Amendment .	-4.1499
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.1922
But last Monday he came to the White House , while reports were held that he was about to resign .	-4.2341
Instead , a meeting with Trump was announced for Thursday , at the time of the United Nations in New York .	-3.2596
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the sitting was delayed to avoid a clash with the Senate ’ s Justice Committee hearing in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-10.1273
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation into claims against Kavanaugh , and continued to delay a full Senate vote .	-2.9602
Donald Trump ’ s spokesperson , Sarah Sanders , was on Sunday at Fox News .	-2.2875
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' An appointment has not yet been made , it could be this week , I could see that I would go back another week , given all the other things that go before the Supreme Court .	-6.3017
But we will see and I always keep the press up to date ' .	-2.7073
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September . the of , , and .	-5.2661
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.8576
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not due to an aversion to television reporters who acted as self-actors , but she also said : ' I will not oppose them being in the gallery ' .	-5.8746
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.3402
" The President raises more questions and answers than any president before him , " she said and added , without giving any evidence : " We have looked at these figures . "	-4.9213
Spending will still take place , Sanders said , but if the press has the chance to put questions directly to the President of the United States , that is infinitely better than talking to it .	-5.2643
We are trying to do a great deal about this , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press debate if you can speak to the President of the United States himself . ”	-4.6831
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House , or talks to public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-10.4256
Conferences with one person are rare .	-2.1034
In New York , the president this week perhaps showed why , by making a frank and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-5.4862

The new policy comes only a few weeks after Boris Johnson demanded a stamp cut to help more young people own their first home .	-3.5697
He accused large construction firms of holding house prices high by buying land at a favourable rate , but not building it , and also called on Mrs May to abolish quotas for affordable housing in order to end the housing gap in Britain .	-7.6528

" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this association back to the Premier League ? "	-2.7292
With its structure and facilities , this club is without doubt part of the Premier League , ” he said .	-3.4227
" Getting there is no easy task , but I would probably only see myself successful if I can get the club back there . "	-4.5792
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as a co-coach at Dumbarton and a 15 months spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-3.4888
He then helped Alloa to recover from the relegation to the third class , and gave St. Mirren the title of the title in the following season .	-6.2737
Ross also says that during his playing career at Clyde , HartlePool , Falkirk , St Mirren , and Hamilton Academical , he never felt as comfortable as he is now .	-4.9777

The heatwave has increased revenues for the hit British pubs , but has increased pressure on the restaurant chains .	-4.2973
Pub- and bar-groups received a 2.7 % turnover plus in July - but the income in restaurants grew by an approximate 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-7.1574
Peter Martin , the corporate consulting CGA , which has compiled the figures , said : " Preservation of sunshine and England for longer than expected participation in the World Cup resulted in July following a similar pattern as in the previous month of June , when the pub visits increased by 2.8 % , only that the restaurants were more affected .	-7.8042
The drop in the catering business by 1.8 % in June only worsened in July .	-2.8881
pubs and bars dominated by drinks were the hardest off , with Like-for-Like numbers rising more than restaurants fell .	-5.6469
The food-dominated pubs also suffered the sun , though not as dramatic as the restaurant operators .	-4.3481

Paul Newman , an RSM analyst for leisure and hospitality , said : " These results continue the trend we have seen since the end of April .	-3.4527
The weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling the extra-house market .	-4.8892
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still under pressure , although a decline of 4.8 percent compared to the previous year will be particularly painful , along with continuing cost pressure .	-5.5475
The long hot summer could not have come at a worse time for food operators , and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will take the necessary break .	-4.9455

Milk pump advertising , where mothers are compared to cows , has led to controversial online discussions .	-5.2878
A milk pump company has provoked controversial online discussions , owing to an ad where breastfeeding mothers are compared to milk-cows .	-5.0233
On the occasion of the launch of the supposedly " world first noisy and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show which freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-5.5407
Four real mothers dance in a herdship in the middle of cows to a number with the following lyrics : " Yes , I am melle , but you do not see any tail " and " If you did not notice that there are no Euler , they are my breasts . "	-7.5395
The slogan goes on : " Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump , pump off , pump , I melke my Ladies ' .	-4.6681
However , the display published on the Facebook page of the company has caused controversy online .	-3.4093
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from viewers , many of whom say that it highlights the " horror " of the dairy economy .	-3.3617
" It is a very bad decision to advertise cows for this product " .	-3.5632
As we also have to become pregnant and bear them in order to produce milk unless their babies are taken away from them within just a few days of their birth , " wrote a person .	-5.1232

Another comment , " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-3.2839
But , yes , why should we not use them to promote a milk-pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.5887
Someone else added : ' So an outsider 's acquisition ' .	-3.2314
Others defended advertising , including a woman who confessed that she found the song “ urcomic ” .	-4.0632
I think that is a great idea .	-1.2723
I would have received one if I had still done so .	-2.6047
Through the pumps I felt exactly like a cow .	-2.3858
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.2023
This is a brilliant product " wrote a person .	-1.8154
Another comment said : ' This is a funny advertisement for mothers who are pumping away ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-4.2131
This is not an advertisement praising or assessing the dairy industry ' .	-3.2653
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced in their BHs with the decent pumps .	-4.8685
The campaign ’ s concept is based on the realization that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows .	-2.8158
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely noisy , has no wires or hoses and fits quietly into a still box , giving women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out in the pump .	-6.9316
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD commented on Mother : " The elf pump is such a revolutionary product that has earned a bold and provocative market launch .	-4.3690
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on chest pumps and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring with it .	-4.6031

Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a tent camp at the Texas border .	-2.8996
The number of children imprisoned with a migrant background increased , although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policy made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-4.7814
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants themselves , and fear that they will risk being referred to when they work for a child .	-4.1939
The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their budgets would be fingerprinting and that data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-5.5157
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified at Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had advertised to support unaccompanied minors .	-4.2244
The agency later confirmed that 70 % of those detained had no previous criminal records .	-4.4275
" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens .	-3.2752
" So we keep following these people , " said Albence .	-3.2142

The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they are anxious or depressed , which may lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-4.4249
Advocates have said that these concerns are reinforced in a larger body like Torllo , where evidence that a child has to fight is more likely to be overlooked because of its size .	-6.2290
They added that moving children to the camping town without having enough time to emotionally prepare them or to adopt friends could exacerbate a trauma that many already struggle with .	-6.1077
Syria calls on the US , French and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw .	-4.8463
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouse-called , before the UN General Assembly , for Syrian refugees to return home , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-4.4218
Mouses , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that the foreign forces were illegal on Syrian territory under the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ they will deal with it . ”	-5.6568
“ You need to withdraw immediately unconditional , ” he told the Assembly .	-3.1010
At the same time , Mousal maintained that the “ war on terror ” in Syria was almost over . More than 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , and millions more have been driven out of their homes .	-6.7068
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this sacred battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence . ”	-2.8550
The US has roughly 2,000 troops in Syria ; mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs , who oppose President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.5393
France has used over 1,000 ground soldiers in the war-torn country .	-3.5702
On the question of refugees , Moual said that the conditions for return were right , and he accused “ of stoking some Western countries irrational fears ” that caused refugees to remain distant .	-5.4298
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate the return , ” he says .	-4.5324
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.7053
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria if there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition to an end to war .	-6.1894
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey to establish a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold of Idlib could advance political talks .	-3.2393
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russia on the province of Syria , where three million people live .	-3.8088

He outlined for the jury how he brought together the movements of the 29-year-old accused Quinta Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers during the night of their death using mobile phone recordings .	-6.7154
Rowlett said he received location data from several mobile phones that showed that Tellis was at Chambers in the evening of her death , which opposed his previous claims , The Clarion Ledger reported .	-5.2446
The analysis of the data on Chambers mobile had shown that he was in the company of his friend Michael Sanford , then Sanford was interrogated by the police .	-4.9073
Sanford announced on Saturday that he was not in the city on that day .	-2.9814
On the question of prosecutors whether Tellis spent the night in Sangford ’ s Truck , he replied that he lied because his truck was in Nashville at that time .	-4.4373

Now , Maurice is suing the pair to pay compensation for the dismissal and demanding a compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time setting for which she was originally hired , albeit without a contract .	-7.5393
“ I will show them , they look , you don ’ t do it , ” she told the post on Friday , and added : “ I know that this is discrimination . ”	-5.0672

“ It ’ s very amusing – now that we know about Paddintons ’ great success . ”	-2.9700
She said that her father , who had previously worked as BBC cameraman , and was inspired to write a children 's book of a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , and added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication after his death last year was “ bitterü<unk> . ”	-5.7905

FBI data have begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-3.5480
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he has asked for - an inquiry that is limited in time and scale - we could perhaps achieve a little unity , ” he said on Saturday , and added that he fears that the committee “ falls apart ” in the midst of a deeply entrenched party-political blockade .	-7.9928
Why did Mr Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to be identified ?	-2.7034
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-1.7145
Until the midterm elections are only five weeks , on 6 November – if the Republicans are doing badly , as expected , they will be severely weakened in trying to advance the man who wants to be elected to the country ’ s highest court .	-7.2088

Pyongyang has not expressed its opinion publicly .	-2.5020
After all , the majority of North Korea ’ s whispers receive South Korean citizenship .	-3.8490
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953 .	-1.6153
Most of them run across China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-3.5258
China views cross-country runners as illegal migrants , not refugees , and often forcibly returns them .	-4.2265

Nancy Pelosi refers to Brett Kavanaugh as hysterical and says that he is unsuitable for the service of the Supreme Court .	-3.0192
The leader of the democratic minority group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court “ hysterical , ” said that he was unable to serve the Supreme Court from temperament .	-6.0832
Pelosi made the comments at an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-2.0966
“ I could not think other than that if a woman had ever behave like that , she called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate justice committee on Thursday .	-5.2490
After leaving school , he began to study at the University of California .	-10.9860
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he shouted almost and fought with the tears when he talked about his family and his high school years .	-3.2445
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee and called the allegations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated campaign of reprimands ” organized by liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-5.3333
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh 's statement proved that he could not serve the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against democrats .	-4.1108
“ I believe that he is disqualifying himself with such statements and the way in which he is influenced by the Clinton and Democrats , ” she said .	-4.4717
When asked whether she would seek impeachment against Kavanaugh in the event of his confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , Pelosi hesitated .	-3.5569
“ I want to say the following : if he does not tell the truth to Congress or the FBI , he is not only unsuitable for the service of the Supreme Court , but also for the service to the court where he is currently engaged , ” Pelosi explained .	-5.9382
Kavanaugh is currently district judge in D.C. Court of Appeals .	-3.6629
Pelosi added that she , as a democrat , was concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. , because he stands for conservative justice .	-3.7584
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh has dodged questions as to whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions .	-5.1718
“ It is not time for a hysterical , biased person to go to court and expect us to say : “ Is this not wonderful , ” said Pelosi .	-3.9261
And women must stop it .	-2.4007
It is a real inflammatory speech , months and years of anger , and it cannot get rid of it without crying .	-4.1393
" We cry when we become angry , " said Mrs Steinem 45 years later to me .	-2.8825
" I do not think that this is unusual , or ? "	-8.0818
She continued : “ I once helped a woman in the executive who told me that she was crying when she was angry , but she developed a technique in which she every time she became angry and began to cry to the person with whom she spoke , said : “ You like to think that I am sad because I cry .	-7.0098
I am angry . '	-1.4049
Then it simply went on .	-2.7040
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.1284
tears are allowed as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-3.0516

How the trade war between China and the US could be beneficial to Beijing	-1.9618
The opening trade war between the US and China has been deafening and an end to the conflict is not in sight ; a gap between the two countries can , in the long run , be an advantage for Beijing , experts say .	-5.8134
US President Donald Trump launched the first warning early this year by stoking important Chinese exports , such as solar panels , steel , and aluminum .	-3.4230
The introduction of new tariffs to US imported Chinese products worth $ 200 billion ( <unk> 150 billion ) this week has led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-2.8491
Beijing has reverted each time in the form of tangible benefits , most recently raising the tariffs of five to ten % on American goods worth $ 60 billion .	-5.8702
China answers every blow to the US with a backlash , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will fall in the near future .	-3.5452
To bring Washington to justice means giving in to demands , but to submit publicly to the United States would be far too embarrassing for Xi Jinping , the president of China .	-5.1728
But if Beijing uses its opportunities correctly , the trade war with the US can have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies , experts say .	-4.4879
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers previously , ” said Abigail Grace , a scientific worker at the Center for New American Security , a think tank with the focus on Asia .	-4.4102
