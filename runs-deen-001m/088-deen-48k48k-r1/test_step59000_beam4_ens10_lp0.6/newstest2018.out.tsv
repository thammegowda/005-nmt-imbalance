Munich in 1856 : Four maps that change your view of the city .	-3.2010
A mistaken institution where young people are to be met today .	-5.9954
A mine chapel where the train tunnel is now under construction .	-5.3480
Kleingärtner managed the former land of farmers .	-3.0232
The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.3564
It annoying that cards are not current .	-3.2668
Everyone who has had to get up and running is aware of this , because the AutoNavi set a green meadow instead of a walk.	-6.8251
The historic maps of the digital Bayern-Atlases , an offer by the Bavaria Geoport of the State Government , are far from current - but this is precisely why they are very illuminating .	-7.0481
Especially if you compare them with current online cards .	-2.0953
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities have changed since the 19th century in the distribution area of Munich .	-4.0184
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that you don 't see as such .	-5.7032
More detailed maps have been added to the large overview lists for cities and communities .	-5.0585
These were based on Bavarian survey management between 1810 and 1864 and were the first surveying of Bavaria .	-5.4342
Your principal : Napoleon .	-2.5962
Since spring 1800 , the French army leader occupied Bavaria with Austria during the Second Coalition War .	-3.8375
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and ordered a topographic capture of Bavaria - for military purposes , of course .	-4.4970
Even though the French troops finally retired with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801 : it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern-Karte .	-6.2140
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph pushed the project further forward , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian Finance Board .	-5.7768
The Munich Urpositioning sheet dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian National Library .	-4.4936
The comparison in former times / Today is the most impressive example of the state capital .	-4.9467
The city has expanded in all directions and has grown together .	-3.0798
One example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the 1856 map .	-3.3126
Sendling was admitted 21 years after creating the map , that is , 1877 , as a Munich district .	-4.8283
Today , Untersendling is located in the heart of the city .	-6.9944
The Untersendlings houses are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plingansstra<unk>e , which was only named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the rebellion of Bavarian farmers against Austria in 1705 .	-5.9857
Where the West Park is today , you can see nothing as a field - at first glance : a smaller card with dozens of lines and numbers appears in the lower part of the zoom map : hand-numbered flurpieces from the so-called " original " from which the base tax was derived .	-10.4380
Small plots of land in the sun are no longer farmers there - they are small fishermen of the " land in the sun " plant .	-7.4100
A large green area is situated north of Untersendling .	-3.1634
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the site of the Oktoberfest , was actually a meadow in the 19th century and not a concrete wasteland .	-4.6468
On the other side of Isar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.4942
In the Urlaubsblatt you can read not only the street name " on the Gasteig " or on the hill " On the fan " - but also in large letters " Irren Institute " .	-7.1296
Yes , here on the Auerfelstra<unk>e , people were once locked up with misconceptions .	-5.7627
In 1858 / 59 the Munich " Auf der Auer Lüschen " was established .	-6.7184
From 1872 Dr. Bernhard von Gudden directed the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought to death by King Louis II .	-4.6085
" He was progressive for his time and , for example , ended the catridges of the so-called errors .	-4.6974
He has also banned the use of force against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum of Haidhausen , who has worked for an exhibition on the Institute .	-5.5784
280 patients had first place , then expanded to 500 places .	-3.2376
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Kreis-Irnantalt in Hair in 1905 .	-7.4185
Since 2006 , the Isar-Amper-Klinik München-Ost , one of Germany 's largest psychiatrics , is located .	-5.9695
On the premises of the former Auer Institute , young people in Munich are now meeting in Salesianum .	-5.3757
The order bought the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training companies .	-3.9701
Westlich lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost , east residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.5451
The children 's house " Casa Don Bosco " was built in 2015 , based on an architectural basis on the original building of the Irsenanstalt , which was destroyed during the Second World War at bomb attacks .	-7.2004
Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as " Main Square " , the shopping street was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.8348
A decisive change brought the Second World War to the heart of Munich .	-3.4513
The Allies ' bombs in December 1944 set many holes in the city centre .	-5.4622
A big remained today - at the Marienhof .	-4.0024
The English Institute , small shops and a medieval mine band once stood at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work took place these days , and on April 5 , 2017 the construction of the second S-Bahn railway railway station .	-10.7673
With the slider you can compare the old Munich map with today 's aerial photo - and fill up the hole at the Marienhof .	-5.7351
Citizens ' rights group publishes Travel Warning for Missouri .	-3.9411
The National Association for the Promotion of Colorful has issued a warning for colorful people travelling to Missouri due to discriminatory policies and racist attacks .	-3.5157
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , which is due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travelers , visitors , and Missouri to attract particular attention and caution when traveling through the state , as a number of questionable , race-based incidents have recently occurred and are recorded in the entire state , " says the Group 's opinion .	-7.9970
A recently enacted law by Missouri , which makes it harder for people to win discrimination claims , and the law enforcement authorities of the state , which disproportionately target minorities , led the group to issue travel warning , said NAACP .	-10.3326
" They have violations of citizens ' rights that happen to people .	-3.0553
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of Missouri , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-4.8724
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . '	-2.5876
It is the first such warning issued by the Organization for a State in the United States .	-2.7162
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-3.3606
Sanders died in dubious circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no more petrol during his trip to the state and was taken prisoner by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-6.5539
The Council also points to a recent report by the Attorney General of Missouri , which shows that black drivers in the state are more commonly regarded as white in 75 % .	-5.7562
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and employees about what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-3.5664
'People must be prepared to bring in cash or let the relatives know that they travel through the state ' .	-6.0519
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime program , which classify the state as 16 in terms of the number of such violations .	-4.9937
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law , which would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-3.0981
Before that , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states passed immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , which , in the view of the ACLU , will help further racial .	-6.2382
Travel warnings are usually issued by the State Department for other countries , but lately , stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-4.2127
Weimar project is an elementary one .	-3.6360
The Fischbacher Weidecaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-3.9198
The CDU-Federal Chancellor Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the spot .	-7.2898
At the rights college of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the CDU association of fishermen met together with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-5.3257
Markus Schwendemann initially offered insights into his company , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied 40 dairy cows and as many young animals as possible and hosted in five apartments guests .	-6.3402
For him , ' black forest milk ' is the alternative way of marketing for the milk of his cows , says Schwendemann .	-4.9774
Only regional guests are on the table .	-4.7413
Since he is also the Chairman of the BLHV Fischbach , he described the Weill project as " essential " .	-6.8418
I cannot be profitable on such steep areas .	-2.0912
The grassland area for a lot of work , and much needs to be done with the motor-sense .	-5.5623
" We have to deal with the conditions and the topography here , " underlined Schwendemann .	-4.3633
In 2003 , he took over the parent company and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertiliser , even if he does not run a bioplant .	-3.9590
For the Mayor of Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The Commune has recognized the importance of the Weidecaun project and is happy with the lead promotion " .	-7.1165
Farmers should be supported at the cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare .	-3.2421
We hope that this will allow for a long time to go beyond the afforestation of the land .	-4.9321
" The biggest treasure we have , are the people who work in agriculture and are concerned about how they carry on their operations , " said the mayor .	-5.0148
Farmers are often criticised for their support .	-2.6271
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots of eleven participants were allocated for grazing purposes .	-4.7963
The area of conservation is therefore 40 hectares , which must not be forestry until at least 2023 .	-4.6917
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half of the population was funded by Leader , a quarter of which was the municipality of Fischbach .	-6.2554
Thus , farmers have remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of wildlife .	-4.8274
" The great advantage is the longevity of fences " , explained Schwendemann .	-2.7319
Kordula Kovac stressed : " Your job is really good , without farmers and farmers it is not going ' .	-5.1012
Peter Wei<unk> also noted : " Here are the best food produced " .	-4.0798
The Landscape Protection Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state support for grazing cows .	-3.9926
The aim is to keep the black forest open .	-1.9209
The condition is that there is a subsidy trap called the LPR .	-5.2663
Moreover , the area that is being put in place must not be navigable ( the slope is more than 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-6.8447
For the Fisherbacher WeidecaurProject in 2018 , the application is currently being made by eight participants with 24 plots who want to build about 16 kilometres of fence .	-6.7398
The open space is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-3.8469
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.9024
Now the Trump White House is toppling the Statue of Liberty	-2.8941
The surest sign of regime change is when they begin to attack statues .	-1.6741
Americans appreciate this , as well as any other - hence the carefully staged overthrow of Saddam Hussein at the Fira Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-5.2379
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he was doing when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN on the president ’ s proposals for drastic curtailment of legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .	-4.5285
To stay fair , Miller did not control the statue itself .	-2.1667
A Horde of boat owners and Liberty-Imitators would have had him yellow if he had done so .	-4.5520
But he attacked their importance , and in particular the importance attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , its basis .	-4.8765
When Miller Acosta complained : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightened the world .	-3.4993
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-3.1336
Miller is objectively correct , but , as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-3.3218
It is about the contemporary response to the chilling words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only some old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mugs , your poor , your hard-pressed masses , who crave to breathe freely , / the wretched waste of your rich coasts ' .	-6.4119
There was never a time when the " wretched waste " was better seen on our screens .	-3.2878
Miller did not commit himself to literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-3.5144
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict over the meaning of America .	-3.5289
Lazarus - and their friends who tried to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they had a highly political action .	-5.5156
The sculpture was intended to show the links between French and American Republics by presenting , in a used classical presentation , the female embodiment of freedom .	-7.2381
Lazarus changed this meaning : in her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-2.9905
And she gives herself a very different name : mother of exiles .	-2.7665
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-3.4391
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it long ago .	-4.0709
The great metaphor of Trump ’ s arrival in 2010 , Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist , argued that the Statue of Liberty was not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative , bringing the American flame to the later world : " Lady Liberty is advancing .	-6.1942
It is to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.2428
The torch was not asked to take the road to the United States . '	-3.7349
Limbaugh was quite unusual here .	-4.6668
The significance of the statue is absolutely a question of the position of perception .	-2.7966
The great imaginative deed of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , miserable , but hopeful people after long and often terrible trips on the decks of ships .	-4.5703
The real issue is to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.2341
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they have to hear .	-5.4764
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-3.5274
Their torch is not meant to fuel the way , but rather to spark the hatred , which is its only source of power .	-5.0041
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black lobt Scottish members of the UK team	-2.8004
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the British team .	-2.9387
The performance director of the UK track & field field , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the World Cup vessel ' will make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-5.1452
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .	-1.8929
Black believes that " something special develops in Scotland " and the UK 's track & field has to learn from it .	-4.0369
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , " said Black .	-2.1870
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.9736
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.4202
British Track & Field : It has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0146
Also with the type on the street corner .	-2.4479
Whatever the combination of circumstances is , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-6.4379
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m track , while Eilidh Doyle has been elected a team captain .	-5.4146
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.7684
Her captain 's speech was unbelievable ' , says Black .	-2.4953
" A number of athletes , whether they were physically or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and highly motivated .	-3.6216
The passion and the real feeling that brought Eilidh naturally were great . '	-4.6629
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will compete at the four four four metre World Championships , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-6.3875
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup has been seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-4.3509
This is the route that Mr Muir has set up five British and two European records last year .	-5.0238
It will take part in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m runners .	-4.3765
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1.500 m , is another Scot to watch after a great season that included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.6859
Doyle remembers her first World Championship , when the only other Scot in Team Lee McConnell was .	-3.6882
The team pilots say that they are " very proud " of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen are not only members of the team , but in some cases also involved in the medals and finals .	-17.8211
" The special thing about being team team team team team specialists is that they were chosen by the other members of the team , so it was a great honour anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , makes it something very special for me " , she added .	-8.4824
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots who belong to the team .	-1.8560
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.5364
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podium .	-3.2294
As regards my speech as a captain ?	-2.4601
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.1332
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation , because we have a home World Cup .	-3.9746
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to profit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-3.5238
I will have a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be a great atmosphere out there ' .	-4.1350
Blocking critics about Facebook : Do not charge you for a public office if you cannot accept stoking voters .	-4.7897
Our country ’ s father knew of a bad press .	-2.0086
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to political principles .	-2.9164
He trumped criticism , safe .	-3.1743
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.2031
In 1783 Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be taken away - and , stupid and stupidly , we are being fought like sheep . '	-4.9784
That brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who has to work on being more like Washington .	-2.5644
Hogan ’ s employees blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on his official Facebook page .	-3.8028
The American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week .	-2.9483
The governor 's staff dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.3384
" It 's just Facebook " , said many people .	-1.6335
But it is important .	-1.0506
And it is especially important when it is a type like Pagan .	-2.9797
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is astonishingly popular .	-2.6251
It has the second highest approval of the 50 Governor of the nation .	-2.9252
Hogan is not a reactionary hothead .	-1.2516
He has shown a firm hand in the leadership of his state and strict adherence to the principles .	-3.9248
He was also very adept at using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his constituents and playing his reckless head after chemotherapy on his side .	-4.4032
Therefore , the blocking of people who come to the side of the Governor - who is a public forum called officially and paid for by employees who are paid with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.8158
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesperson Amelia Chase defended the actions of the governor and argued that the blocking of comments was nothing more than a presentation .	-5.0898
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who are driving the stick online .	-6.0643
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.6543
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , not trolls .	-3.2572
They all said that their comments were respectful , reflective and not professional .	-2.6004
The priest quoted the Bible in his post , calling on hooligans Catholic faith .	-2.9437
Lawyers Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , MH . , was not hairfilling , but she asked about hate crimes .	-3.7494
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the comments section of the message " The Post " .	-3.3571
" I do not value this idea , even if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some people tend to ignore it as a so-called collective effort and not recognised as a large group of citizens affected ' .	-7.6096
What the governor ’ s staff called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ intercommunication . ”	-5.4334
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-2.2539
It is much cleaner than in the past if the same thing had been done is for employees to be sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorial articles , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-5.9579
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.5921
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-1.9131
President Trump is sued by Twitter users who have been blocked by his Twitter feed .	-2.2721
One of the first milestones on this issue was in Virginia last week .	-2.0324
The chair of the Board of Governors of the Loudoun County wounded the First Amendment , according to US judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she expelled a voter from her Facebook page .	-5.0699
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU due to his use of Facebook and Twitter . , , and , .	-6.0217
This should not be so difficult .	-1.6797
At the time of Washington , the era of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet .	-3.8335
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous writers appealed to his leadership .	-3.1359
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.1035
The people who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington decisions .	-4.2217
Petitions that criticized his position on the Agreement of Amity , trade , and shipping with Britain overcame his office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project 's online paper .	-5.1885
But he did not silence them .	-1.8553
Freedom of speech , difference of opinion and discourses belong to the basis of our nation .	-3.0361
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.8303
Ronan Rafferty hopes for domestic comfort in the Renaissance Club	-2.5580

Fewer lung cancer rates through Passive smoking	-5.2053
Over the past two decades , fewer and fewer people have died because of passive smoking of lung cancer .	-2.5317
Scientists from the University Hospital Hamburg Eppendorf ( UKE ) will be attending a study .	-4.6509
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases per year are due to passive smoking , " said Head of study Heiko Becher .	-3.3287
In comparison , he drew up his own study on the 1994 issue .	-4.6115
Back then , there were 400 lung cancer cases per year due to passive smoking in Germany .	-3.2389
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.3899
Household access is a very complex issue .	-3.7198
The construction works in the Villinger street are in full swing and " are somewhat in time " , says the head of the building court Fred Heinze .	-4.9987

Papua is Indonesia 's poorest province , where 28 % of people live below the poverty line and some of the worst rates of child mortality and literacy in Asia .	-2.7829
But it is also Indonesia 's Goldland .	-1.7329
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grassberg , owned by Freeport McMoran from Phoenix , is only 60 miles away from Paniai , a high land province in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-4.3735
In 2015 alone , Freeport lost gold and copper worth $ 3.1 billion .	-2.7108
Moreover , Papua has an estimated US $ 78 billion in timber resources .	-2.5035
But this wealth is a source of misery for Papua , which ensures that Indonesia ’ s powerful military will maintain a suffocating presence .	-4.9282
A study in the New York Times in 2005 reported that Freeport paid almost US $ 20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 in a single officer .	-8.6647

The former carpenter secured 27 of the altogether 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.7322

" Our hearts are broken because we voted in 2014 for Jokowi , with the expectation that he will fulfil our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.8353

On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children was out there and sang Christmas songs in Enararalli , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a motorcycle .	-5.6387
The terrified children told them that they should turn their headlights on .	-3.5441
One of the soldiers took the offensive in their tone and then came back with four soldiers , so the local Pastor Yavedt Tes.	-6.8665
The soldiers who had drunk were hunting and beat the group with their guns , said victims and witnesses .	-2.4711
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-2.0267
A child , Yulianus Yeimo , aged 16 , was struck so hard that he fell into a coma .	-3.7789
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was burned , and things escalated the next day .	-2.9860
Around 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered on a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command centre to demand justice .	-3.5084
They wore ceremonial hunting arches and presented the Waita dance - constantly imitating a bird song - by Papuas Mee Pago .	-5.4152
Some demonstrators started to smuggling stones into police and military posts .	-3.9079
When the mood was heating up , a command was sent to the soldier via an internal radio : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " says it in an official document of TIME , which was not released to the local media .	-5.9629
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the director of the Kego Koto neighborhood of Enarararali , saw the threat and called for peace and demanded the quantity to return home .	-6.1590
Nobody was in the mood to listen .	-1.1134
" When I turned around , I was shot into my left hand joint , " he said TIME on the verandation of his colorful painted wooden house .	-4.7397
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers assembled here .	-2.8691
" It was crowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-3.1684
The native man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin , who was a witness to shooting .	-3.5315

Human Rights Watch said that five young demonstrators were killed and many others were injured .	-2.4989
The news about the killings came only after the following day ' filtered ' after Jakarta .	-7.0802
Three weeks , Jokowi in Jayapura delivered a passionate speech expressing sympathy for the victims ’ families and swarming to address historical grievances in Papua .	-4.5203
" I want this case to be resolved immediately so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-2.8087
Security minister , Mr Wiranto , said in October 2016 that he set up an extra-judicial mechanism for resolving historical human rights violations .	-4.8188
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.4424
" Most injuries happened a long time ago .	-1.5535
Some were in the 1990s and at the beginning of the 2000-year-old .	-3.0520
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .	-3.6340
Then Wiranto made a retreat when he spoke with TIME in Jakarta on June 5 , and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-4.1548
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.3665
Wiranto , accused by the UN of ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 lives in East Timor ’ s bloody 1999 vote of independence , said that 11 cases of human rights violations have already been resolved in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-5.0710
The Paniai families made such claims with fierce disbelief .	-5.4563
" I have been interviewed four times over the past three years , but there has been no progress , " said Yohanes .	-2.6237
'I am tired ' .	-0.6888
He says that he still lives in fear for years later .	-1.9165
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.3975
" I am afraid to be arrested by the military , am afraid to be shot . "	-2.6695
His brother Yacoubus repeated the view that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-3.6090
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.3252

The shootings have not stopped .	-1.6676
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot at villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai .	-3.1550
During a confrontation between villagers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a fearless man to hospital , a person died and 17 others were injured , including children .	-4.3020
The man , who was 24 years Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he was fishing in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.6870
Forced villagers protested in front of the company 's location office .	-3.6244
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.3642
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began shooting and killing .	-2.5613
" We were so in panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominiggu Badii , who lives near the hospital and witnessed how the injured was quickly returned here , said the TIME .	-5.6356
" I hid myself in my house two days . "	-2.7839
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers to be held accountable and for withdrawing the mobile police brigade from the area .	-5.6558
Paniai was always an unruffle for the Indonesian Government .	-4.4307
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the dissatisfaction of the tribal peoples Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the Papua green highlands .	-4.5760
Many joined the Free Papua Movement ( OPM ) , the rebel army that claims to defend the rights of Papua by encouraging sporadic attacks and abductions of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.9860
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tasks yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-4.9479
In response to this , thousands of people have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested in Paniai in recent years , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.0581
Some never recur .	-2.3836
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as ' a tragic , forgotten place ' .	-2.9450
Poverty strengthens discontent .	-1.3099
The amount of rice sold in Enararalei is too expensive for locals .	-4.0977
Bread is just as out of reach .	-3.0139
The people here build everything they eat : especially Nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-4.1314
Agriculture is the job of women who can each process four or five fields of sweet potato .	-4.1407
They keep most of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.4942
Ten pieces of Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.4719
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants , which have been in greater numbers since the opening of new routes to the Nabire airport .	-5.4771
The few jobs that exist in the region are generally for better-educated and wealthier migrants .	-4.0528
Papua rarely has the capital or the necessary skills to make its own businesses competitive .	-2.8540
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money here , " says John Gobai , the leader of Paniai 's tribal council .	-3.4169
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.6568
Moreover , restrictions on reporting international media remain tense .	-2.1283
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , even though they were given the rare permission to film .	-3.4807
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , Jokowi ’ s campaign promises to lift the restrictions on reporting in order to promote transparency and development were not realized .	-6.5028
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists who are trying to report to Indonesia 's most restless provinces of Papua and West Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6291
Lack of press control means that international pressure on Indonesia ’ s government remains largely confined to Papua ’ s immediate neighbors .	-3.3651
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Alliance and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the " various and widespread violations " in Papua , including the Paniai shooting .	-5.0563
These same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.4143
The speaker of the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , Arrmanatha Nasir , rebuffed the group and said journalists in Jakarta : ' There is still a democratic system in Indonesia , and there are free media so that it is difficult to conceal the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-5.4709
Local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.9201
When an official delegation from the Netherlands visited Jayapura on 4 May under the leadership of the Human Rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , locals broke their silence and forced him " We want freedom " , in accordance with a source that also participated in the session but wants to remain anonymous .	-6.0459
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua has said that they are unlikely to vote again for Jokowi .	-2.8183
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the paniai shots , " says Gobai , the leader of the tribal council .	-3.9728
He wants Jokowi to know that the people of Panama , apart from the constant threat of a predatory military , live in poor educational and health services .	-4.1242
Gobai says that Paniai people , like other Papua , see their voice for Jokowi as a " debt " he must pay back .	-4.2543
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.0919
Despite threats and intimidation , Paniai ’ s victims ’ families carried out a last symbolic act of comfort : a victim ’ s body was buried on a site just opposite the police and the military station .	-5.6399
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they do not forget their crimes .	-3.6295

Fire capture the ' Torch ' skyscrapers of Dubai for the second time .	-2.5331
A fire broke out on Friday in one of the world ’ s tallest buildings in Dubai , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from 337 metres of 79-floor buildings .	-5.7109
It is the second fire that passes through the high house in just two years , probably called the Torch Tower .	-5.8711
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-1.8919
" We slept and we stood up with the fire alarm and the people shouting .	-3.2336
We ran down the stairs and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor " , a resident who described his name as George angab , Reuters .	-4.3881
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units at 4 p.m. local time ( 00.00 GMT ) were causing fire and cooling the building .	-4.8192
The government said they are working to provide shelter for those affected .	-2.7580
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-4.6979
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 revealed that the greatest part of the damage came from the fairing , the outdoor facing to decoration or isolation .	-7.1016
In Britain , the police said that the system of insulation and coating on the London Grenfell Tower in June could have helped to spread a fire in which around 80 people died .	-6.8134
No Davis-Cup reform : Continue best-of-five	-3.0026
The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) has passed through his large Davis-Cup-Coup at the General Assembly .	-3.5142
At the meeting in Ho Chi Minh City , the proposal for this sport revolutionary to play Davis-Cup-singles only on two win rates was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-5.6460
This is often a very long , but also very valued five-poster classic .	-7.2602
63.54 % of member countries voted in favour of reform , so the ITF-President David Haggerty ’ s goal was barely missed .	-4.7434
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.3075
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historical contests , " said Haggerty .	-2.6495
You will continue to work to improve the impact .	-2.5134
It was not until the vote , after many objections , that the proposal was made to wear the final in a neutral place .	-6.9335
New in 2018 are only comparatively minor details : the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the next year in the first round .	-6.0413
In order to reduce the costs for the organizers , the training places and so on requirements will be facilitated and players will have to complete fewer official media events before the Davis Cup .	-6.3034
More than 1 of 5 US travelers bring prohibited items to the plane , see a poll .	-3.7202
A Air Passive survey found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously forbidden items were bypassed the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent of the aircraft , while accidentally carrying prohibited knives or other items with blades .	-6.5519
Less than 1 % claimed that they were late discovered that they were mistakenly travelling with guns , ammunition or explosives .	-3.9006
The survey among more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charts Inc . - also found that younger travelers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.1838
Of those surveyed who admitted that they had attempted to fly with something banned by TSA , 19.7 % Millennials , compared to less than 15 % , were members of generation X .	-7.3477
The most common items deliberately passed by TSA agents were food and fluids .	-3.0499
More than 3 % admitted that they had knowingly carried items with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs to the plane .	-5.7949
The company said that it interviewed travellers throughout the country in order to find out how many contraband goods would have accidentally brought through airport security and how many would deliberately have done .	-5.9060
It is no surprise that people who wear the most smuggled goods - knowingly or unwittingly - by security were those who fly most frequently .	-5.4891
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are rather complicated and confusing .	-2.6112
People are often unsure about which fluids they can take with them or how much of it .	-4.0258
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of the liquids confiscated by TSA are banned .	-5.5437
For a time , people thought that TSA could see books as contraband .	-3.1752
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.9011
Elon Musk does not care : Tens of thousands of Tesla customers drop their orders .	-4.4748
Electro-thousendsassa Elon Musk is pleased to announce the huge number of reservations for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.6955
In doing so , he has concluded that some of the customers have already withdrawn their non-binding reservations .	-5.7689
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on turnover increases and even more drastic sales targets , Tesla CEO Elon Musk , in announcing the recent quarterly balance , revealed a different , less striking figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-7.9134
Musk had often raised more than 500,000 reservations for the new car over the past few months , whose delivery is just beginning .	-5.4817
Musk now admits : of the total 518.000 reservations , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-5.0822
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are only non-binding reservations .	-2.7633
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay 100 euros ( US $ 1,000 in the USA and <unk> 1000 in the UK ) " reservation deposit " in full .	-6.3944
455,000 such no-obligation reservations are available at the moment , and the Musk has received a telephone conference with analysts .	-6.5604
However , the Tesla boss does not believe that the cancellation of roughly twelve percent of all orders could become a problem .	-4.4999
His argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-2.7232
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-0.8861
In 2018 , all models are expected to be 500,000 , 2020 being a million .	-3.8382
There is obviously a need for this .	-2.8659
According to Musk there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-1.7194
Whoever orders a " Model 3 " today may expect delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without any major disruption to capacity utilization .	-7.2721
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4875
However , if there are any major delays , the non-binding nature of reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-6.4083
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running away in droves .	-4.2537
EPO boss Pruitt is retreating because the Obama era ’ s rules on reducing emissions are falling .	-6.4128
A day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , took his previous decision to delay implementation of the Obama-era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog producing adequate air pollution .	-5.2700
Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved to be the needs of state environmental authorities in the face of reactionary politicians .	-6.4523
He did not mention the action taken against his previous position in a federal court .	-4.1424
It is a time limit that applied to states on 1 October to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.9423
Pruitt announced in June that he will delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid ' interfering in local decisions or impeding economic growth ' .	-4.0394
Pruitt , who was before his appointment by President Donald Trump ’ s Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental rules .	-4.7713
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that oppose chemical and fossil-fuel industries .	-3.9202
The sudden turn of Wednesday is the recent legal setback for the Pruitt ’ s regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.9996
Last month , a federal court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a Obama-Administration rule requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leakage .	-4.3272
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that its U-turn on ozone standards simply enhances the EPA ’ s willingness to cooperate with states through the complex process of timely compliance with the new standards .	-4.8141
" Under previous administrations , the EPA has often failed to observe the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activists and others , and to set the date for implementation in an agreement , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in its previous job .	-6.3187
" We do not believe in legal proceedings and we take time seriously .	-3.0622
We also take the law and the authority we have . '	-2.2340
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPO stated that , at some point , Pruitt will use its ' competence to delay and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules ' are based on solid policies and the best available information ' .	-5.6797
The Republicans in Congress are pushing for a more comprehensive consolidation of ozone rules .	-3.6970
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.2858
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.6191
The New York Attorney General Eric Tailsman , who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPA this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-4.6150
" The reversal of the EPA - following our complaints - is an important gain in health and safety from these 6.7 million New York core and over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog flooding into their communities , " said Schneermann .	-6.4202
New York joined New York in this case , California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-2.6458
Soil ozone occurs when pollutants from cars , power stations , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources in the atmosphere react to sunlight .	-3.3769
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems for sensitive groups of people and contribute to thousands of premature deaths every year .	-3.0151
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered about Pruitt ’ s surprising change of course .	-4.0176
" It is disturbing how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for the protection of the air we breathe , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.7747
" We must continue to fight the Trump administration ’ s ideological crusade , turn to polluters and their special interests . "	-4.5389

The visitors of the sixth Benefit Committee can be enchanted by this powerful place .	-4.9207
The rescue and maintenance of the oldest building in the town have made the friends and supporters of Tumlingen their concern .	-5.0343
Walter Martini stresses : " It is a unique village jewel " .	-2.7068
In 1267 , the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the history of the Rhine Valley : Count Hermann von Sulz " sold the mountain with the parish church of Tumlingen and the Vogemei " at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 Mark silver .	-7.6483
According to the letter of the document , on the Tumlinger mountain , apart from the former parish church , there was also a noble courtyard , one of which was the church or the right of patronage , and not the other way round .	-7.8049
There were also people living there .	-4.5478
As indicated in the description of Oberamtes Freudienstadt from 1858 , next to the Unterdorf and Oberdorf , which are still visible today in the townscape of Tumlingen , the " mountain " was the third part of the village 's stately core .	-7.2523
Old maps of the year around 1600 reinforce this historical situation .	-4.1158
The Patron Law arose from the early medieval right of self-church .	-5.4317
A gentleman who built a church and decorated it with a priest remained the owner of this church and could inherit this own church .	-5.1021
It was therefore the right to appoint a priest or to propose a new priest to the bishop .	-4.7115
There were three altars in the church and two bells on the tower .	-2.4442
The greater the two crumbled at Christmas 1673 .	-4.0562
The newly opened bell was first mentioned in 1692 , but later it was taken in 1942 .	-7.0947
In the 30-year war ( 1616 to 1648 ) the windows were taken and the bells were stolen .	-4.6631
The roof was leaky .	-1.5390
In 1796 , French troops were stored near the church .	-2.4325
They broke out the chanels and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.1684
Remremains of the church threatened to bring down in 1809 .	-4.0775
Until 1869 , the Tumlinger Hilarius cemetery also served as the last resting place for the dead from horns .	-3.8325
In 1823 the cemetery was enlarged and the Hilarion Church was canceled .	-3.9291
Only the church tower was left to stand .	-3.7494
In New Year ’ s Eve , 1834 , a storm divided the church tower and half .	-6.4215
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was broken . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.6513
Only today the Turmzwerg remains a witness to the 750 years old church history .	-6.1780
Today Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem maintain the Hilarius-facility as successor to Dieter Dockhorn .	-4.3075
As the organisers , Tumlingen 's friends and patrons invite the sixth serade to the old cemetery of the St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday , July .	-6.5748
This is created by the Combo of Kepler ’ s high school of Freudienstadt and with speeches by Kurt Kühler and Reinhold Matteus .	-5.2444
Local leaders Hartmut Romann speak the final word .	-3.4524
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-1.9125
It is open from 3.30 p.m.	-3.7596
At the end of the Serenade , a detachment takes place in front of the cemetery .	-4.9870
" Enjoy a summer evening under the shade of old trees and with the wide view over the meadows to the forest " , the organizers set out the fantastic view .	-6.1057
The Serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-1.8129
The organizers are hoping for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius-facility , which is important for tummies and horns .	-6.4287
Friends and patrons of Tumlingen feel particularly committed to home care , as Serenade organizer Walter Martini affirms .	-6.9950
Association wants to have bikes approved	-4.8557
" Boisheim rejects itself " does not see any legal condition for the construction and has therefore turned to the Land Council .	-4.7385
The club " Boisheim rejects itself " has called on Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw his approval for the construction of planned wind power plants in the Boisheim Nette .	-5.2420
It would be unlawful .	-1.3384
The association argues that at the time of approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheider Nette since at the time of Viersen only a wind power center existed at the city border to Schwalmtal .	-6.9041
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind power plants are generally possible , but at the same time the concentration zone causes exclusion of wind energy consumption for the rest of the city .	-5.2631
These zones are intended to prevent a " sealed " of the landscape .	-5.1712
The city of Viersen had decided , a few days before , by changing the plan for land-use , a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheieider Nette - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a form error .	-8.4825
" Due to the lack of a planning legal requirement , the granted approval certificate remains illegal and therefore also to be withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim rejects " .	-7.0011
The current state of affairs : the town council decided once again the wind concentration zone in the Boisheim Nette before the summer break ; district government approval is still pending .	-6.6989
Erkens : " This means that approval for the construction of wind power plants is legally excluded " .	-5.1446
The circle confirms the entrance of the invitation .	-2.1037
" The corresponding letters have been received by the circle of four since last week " , said a speaker .	-4.6994
It is an opportunity for the circle to look into the matter again .	-4.6711
However , it is not likely that the procedure will be stopped .	-4.0686
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the county on Thursday did not wish to comment on the content of the arguments of the association " Boisheim resisted " .	-6.8241
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , is planning to build four 200 metres of wind turbines on an area on Boisheim Nette .	-5.0027
Last year , the company , in which the town of Viersen is directly involved , closed lease contracts with the owner of the site of about 65 hectares .	-4.9056
With the construction of four wind turbines , the electricity needs of some 11 400 households are to be met - roughly one-fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households .	-5.5164
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-7.3889
Last summer , Viersen City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind power plants in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen , as well as a participation in a wind power plant in Schatzach-alenberg county in Heinsberg .	-7.0592

City and traders are planning " Home-Shoppings " -weekend	-3.8084
Bad Langenalsalaer and people from the region will discover in September the shopping in the city centre .	-5.5374
The trade association and city administration want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants to the city centre .	-6.1510
As the chairman of the trade association , Christian King , has said , the " home shopping " weekend is intended to raise awareness among customers about the offers offered by its own city outside the usual supermarket goods .	-7.8164
Thus a market with regional providers is planned , similar to the weekly market .	-3.3218
In addition , local companies are expected to present themselves with their training places .	-3.7118
In addition , the city centre shops will be inviting you to go shopping in midnight .	-6.4715
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .	-4.5949
In preparation are commercials on the radio , an internet video and printed bags pointing out the action weekend , Christian King .	-3.1471
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-2.9704
The trade association and the city go into another stage of the project " Attractive downtown " .	-4.9645
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Brunnenfest and open Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-5.6157
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the denial of parking charges this day are part of the concept .	-4.6217
Furthermore , customer potential is to be reinvented or re-opened .	-3.7023
These include hotel guests and tourists .	-2.9998
But many locals , too , would lose sight of the city centre when shopping .	-4.2738
In the end , everyone should help to stimulate the city centre - to let alone , to the establishments of the whole city and clubs .	-7.1929
It was necessary to overcome with a network the lethargy that had spread , King said in spring .	-5.7075
Birgit String , Director of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen , announced that the third " home shopping " day , will be taking part for the first time in five Thuringian cities .	-6.8367
In addition to bath Langenalsa , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-3.6780
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasise its importance to the common good of our cities ' , so match .	-4.5885
The actions under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also make it clear that each citizen , with his or her purchasing behaviour , can influence his or her direct environment .	-6.8176

Trump pressed Mexico to pay the border wall after leaked mobiles .	-3.7727
The Washington Post published transcription of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia .	-2.9144
On January 27 , Trump , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , urged Trump to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-3.1694
The US president complained to him because he had publicly denounced the wall , according to him , ' You cannot say this to the press ' .	-5.9562
Trump launched his presidential campaign , promising to build a wall on the southern border of the US , and pledged to let Mexico pay for the project .	-3.6629
His first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-3.2782
Mr. Trump told Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would take on refugees who migrated to Australia " ridiculous " , " miers " , and " stupid " , and that the existence of the trade that the Obama administration communicated would make him look like a " dip " after he proposed a ban on resetting refugees to the US .	-7.5108
Mr Trump finished the call after he told Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.8193
Moore 's Ford Massacre : activists are resurrecting racist Lynchak as a call for justice .	-5.3504
A 1948-Ford Mercury drove through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and shrunk to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-3.8580
Before the car , which had four black passengers and a white driver , could reach the bridge , a group of white men appeared with rifles to block his way . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.9877
The leader of the Mobs - a middle-aged man in a conical suit - took a long train of his cigars and looked through the windshield .	-5.0119
Inhabitants were desperately in fear .	-4.1522
" We want this n ---- r Roger ! " brooks the man .	-2.8921
" Hol him from the car ! "	-2.6320
The silence is torn apart when a young black man was torn apart from the front-passenger seat .	-4.1133
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on July 22 , is only a testament .	-3.9277
But when a snail is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the public breathed very real sighs .	-5.0352
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by the Ku Klux Kla in 1946 .	-5.1212
No one has ever been charged with murders .	-2.2766
" It is really incredible that in all these years , not a single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyron Brooks , who helps organise the post .	-5.8175
" It is a dirt on a history , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.7239
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and a lifetime civil rights activist .	-3.0378
For him , the juxtaposition serves as a dramatic call for action and constitutes an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-4.6271
" We want prosecution , we want the termination , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we have to receive justice , " he said .	-3.5744
" We cannot reach healing and reconciliation until we receive justice . "	-2.7952
One of the victims of the Moore-Ford-Lynchen on 27 July 1946 is a butcher laying over the body .	-7.5337
According to FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 men from Monroe and surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process .	-5.9404
But no one has ever been indicted .	-1.5882
Although the suspects have remained free for decades , civil rights campaigners say that the dual motivation for the lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-4.4220
In April 1946 , a ruling by the Supreme Court allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer election campaign .	-3.6651
About at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , the black farmer Roger Malcom stirred a white baseline owner , Barnett Hester , during a battle - supposedly for a woman .	-5.6520
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hecster slept with Mrs. Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not born of her husband .	-4.4187
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to liberate Malicom from prison , according to the FBI .	-3.7340
He was accompanied to prison by Dorothy and her cousin , Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.7030
But when they moved away from prison , and the Moore 's Ford Bridge approached , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-3.7008
" As it turns out , Mr Harrison , who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-3.8661
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the killing , removed evidence and coveralled the identity of witnesses " .	-4.9099
Brooks makes it even more concise .	-2.7722
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-2.9716
'You have all been killed to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , you will do so here ' .	-3.9803
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual rendition of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-2.9333
Her presentation is vivid , exciting and based on a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe is no longer in America .	-7.0526
It is hard to see and harder to look away , but Greenspan said that this is the point .	-3.4846
" We do not want to talk about the Lynchen , because we will then be confronted with their care in all of us , " she said .	-5.1879
" But I cannot establish a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I have done " .	-3.2641
Samples for this year 's production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors - a dozen white and the rest of the black - pushed into a space and listened when Greene began a well-attended overview of the piece .	-5.3631
Wade Marbaugh is the co-director of Greenes .	-2.9515
He has been playing the role of the Chief Clancer for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-4.3341
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.6389
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-3.1596
On the other hand , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rasona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-4.1195
The piece begins with Malcom , who screams and pushes him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-6.0337
" I said n --he , disappeared from my property ! "	-2.4294
Rasona reacts to the fire .	-3.8116
There is a break .	-1.3544
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.9255
Greene laughs the loudest .	-1.4412
" What ? " asked Rasona .	-2.4000
It is alarming and confused .	-0.8976
Was I too harsh ?	-2.0923
" No " , Greene said , still kicker .	-3.6135
" I simply do not believe that white people at the time ' n --he ' said . "	-4.3330
" But " one of the other black actors was joking .	-5.2233
'You just have to hit the hard ' R. ' .	-3.0199
That is where energy is shifting , a feeling of friendship replaces the discomfort .	-4.5357
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.3912
The scene begins again .	-1.4934
This time , when Rasona says the N-word , he says it strongly and forcefully .	-3.9402
Absolutely no one laughs .	-2.2131
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-1.5011
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-2.4559
A woman dressed with a villain is over the bodies of the actors and runs Billie Holidays grievous eusage " Strange Fruit " .	-6.8211
Her voice breaks with every second word .	-2.2617
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators turns out to sweat and tears .	-4.9571
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-2.2954
A couple is from Ithaca , New York , travelled to see the performance , many just come down the street .	-2.9418
They have lived for almost eight hours in Georgia ’ s impressive moisture when Brooks takes them on a pilgrimage to the Malcoms and Dorseys ’ tomb .	-7.5407
Up to this point , the murders have remained a anecdote , but now , when you are standing in the same country where the lynch murders were carried out , the air feels nervous .	-6.0099
When the last notes of the song end , greens invite the crowd to come closer and inspect the body name .	-4.6129
Children hocken in their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whispers to each other .	-9.4605
" They are not really dead " , murmur a little boy as if he would remember it .	-4.0869
After a few minutes thanks green of quantity - and suddenly it is over .	-2.6669
The actors cast the limelight away and wipe their tears .	-4.0755
Bradshaw chased Marbaugh , the man in the suit who played the clan member .	-3.4459
Nick Rasona dumps two of his companions and then breaks down into her poor , and the emotional burden of performance eventually breaks with him .	-5.6422
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-1.9300
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.6039
You did so for one reason ' .	-1.7929
Later the audience met the actors for dinner .	-2.5765
At a table a white pair from Atlanta quickened by comparing it with a black pair they just met .	-5.4592
Denise Dublinski fought to find words that have left the scene .	-4.6621
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... from people who look like you and who do it because they look like you , " she said .	-3.9787
" What really does this with me leaves me to believe that the Lynchen is still going on , " she added , " today is only called the police tri<unk>ry . "	-7.2975
In the same room , Tyron Brooks Hof keeps his table , he eats and reminds of citizens ' rights .	-4.1857
He said he had already begun planning the performance next year .	-2.7662
" The surrender is somehow inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.2828
" It is so if we do not learn from it , then it can happen again .	-3.9162
Anyone who fails to study his own history , who does not know his own history , is condemned to repeat it . '	-3.2556
" Divine Dawn " conciliated the Changeling in Bayreuth	-4.7718
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf also relies on a bunt-frivole performance in front of gigantic , six-story scenes .	-7.1408
The stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) can be used as a small street corner with the rest of the wall and Dönerboude in Berlin , a " Plaste and Elane " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-7.4080
Before that , an open Mercedes classic car park in which the Rhine grander posits as rockergirls , or alternatively an Isetta .	-6.7001
oiled oil barrels remember Castorfs 's theme - money , power , and greed - which draws on its " ring " staging .	-5.7063
The three Rheinstrand conductors - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonise as much as the " Rheingold " wonderfully .	-5.4691
Kess seduce them Siegfried ( Stefan Vinke ) , squeeze a body in Hollywood Manier in the boot and give the Krawallo-Clique .	-5.1983
Stephen Milling sings the wonderfully fieds Hagen , which surround the aura of a sword boxer .	-4.5595
Brutal the scene when he shoots Siegfried .	-0.8697
Later on , even Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) must believe in this .	-4.4267
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.9528
Stürmically acclaimed are Foster , Milling , Vinke and Conductor Janowski , who is modest and has dedicated his hands to the Merkel-Raudformend .	-7.5228
There is great applause for the festival orchestra , which is on stage for the first time - in view of the great heat again in casual leisure clothing .	-6.3044
The show was eagerly awaited by Frank Castorf and his team .	-3.9911
Had he still had to perform a full pipe concert in 2013 , there were five years later great jubel in which the catchy " Buh " run .	-7.9792
Festspielschfin Katharina Wagner was probably pleased about this .	-4.0691
" One remembers that the audience grew together with the " ring " in a way , " she said shortly before the performance of the dba .	-5.1846
The audience not only made a form of peace with Castorf , but it was also an understanding of his view .	-4.2557
I prefer a positive balance .	-2.4133

On May 31 , a massive bombing campaign in the centre of the city killed more than 150 people with the country ’ s most deadly militant attack since the US troops in 2001 pushed the Taliban out of power .	-4.8307
The violence underlines the precarious security situation in Afghanistan , as US President Donald Trump is careful to increase the number of US troops supporting the military and police in the country .	-3.9974
correspondents say that over recent weeks , the suicide bombings in Kabul have also caused a crisis of public confidence in the government , its policies , and , in particular , the reputation of President Ashraf Ghani .	-5.1302
EPA returns to the decision to delay the smog rule after complaints .	-6.9038
The US Environmental Protection Agency has taken a decision to delay Obama ’ s administration ’ s regulation , which requires states to reduce emissions causing smog , a day after 15 countries sued the Agency for steps .	-6.5060
The EPA late on Wednesday announced the decision to push forward the so-called ' ozone provisions 2015 ' , and said that it demonstrates the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with states .	-5.6372
" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " said EPO boss Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.4821
In June , Pruitt announced the intention of CEPOL to limit the ozone regulations - in which pollutants are to be measured in part of the country in order to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - to delay one year until October 2018 .	-6.4386
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the Colombia district , filed a lawsuit on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-3.6098
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a broad range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump is supposed to boost economic growth .	-5.4665
However , the efforts have triggered the setback of the Democrats and nature conservation groups , which are concerned about the effects of greater emissions on public health .	-4.7064
The Web site of the EPO says that the inhalation of air containing ozone " can reduce the lung function and amplify the respiratory symptoms " such as asthma .	-4.7281
The municipal council wants Community space	-3.1711
In the end , the decision was clear : in the event of two votes against , the council of the municipality of Fluorn-Wincken decided to set up a common space in the future residential area of .	-7.1489
Before the discussion , there is an important information : The contract for the sale of the missing property has been signed , says Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-5.7990
Although it will still take place until the area previously owned by the parish , there is no longer any obstacle to planning the project from a private investor to the silent project .	-8.2251
There is a discussion on a Community area for this .	-3.2854
One of the two investors who are still on board has offered to meet the community .	-4.2118
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-5.7508
The administration and the majority of the Council of the Communities is in charge of providing such a common space not as a meeting point for the residents of the occupied residential community , but also openly into the community .	-9.6062
As an example , the word from the " Strickcafé " went round .	-4.1863
This decision , which was decided by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn , will be lost by means of funding .	-5.3072
The building is located in the urbanization area .	-2.8787
The creation of a Community area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible for 60 % support .	-4.6094
The proposal for a resolution , in order to send a signal to the investor that he does not want to throw a stick between his legs in this regard , suggests that both the saddle - which is similar to the surrounding building - and the pulse roof - would be possible , reducing the level of mourning and building economic power .	-9.2087
Not only Wilfried Sohmer says this addition is necessary .	-3.1952
If it helps , he happens to the body by unanimity .	-4.0787
It is not as simple as the Community area .	-3.0411
Daniela 's reputation refers to the many own buildings with which we do not make much progress , for which we are now opposed to the window of Community space , she says : ' I am struggling with it ' .	-8.6929
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the community space - but absolutely against local participation .	-5.2253
It provides a covert subsidy to anyway well-off or even foreign investors .	-4.1323
That is not the case , because if you buy the surface you do not give a grant , but get a real value that can be marketed in case of doubt , the opposite is the case .	-8.0566
Stavros ’ request to split up the proposal for a resolution accordingly finds three people in favour .	-6.0683
This leaves us with two votes against the original programme , which Stefan Haller summarises : ' If we take the decision in this way , we will make a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-6.7675

Walk Star Harz	-2.2880
In Harz the first " Star Path " is to be created in Germany .	-5.2478
The association plans to open the observatory Sankt Andreasberg .	-5.1308
A planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.6287
A " Starry Path " would satisfy the need for information from many visitors to Harz , it was said .	-6.8598
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.7949
The members want to set up their own route panels and provide information about stars and constellations .	-6.2066
In a first phase until 2018 , the association plans to " successfully reach installations in five to six locations " in Oberharz .	-5.3381
Infrage came to St. Andreasberg , Braun , Hohegei<unk> and Sieber .	-3.7457
The information on the panels should be supplemented by the Internet .	-3.8616
This is why it is important to choose a good mobile network device .	-5.1495
Freedom of accessibility is also a criterion .	-2.1496
Later on , the Zug Start-Path is to be extended by train .	-4.9955
" On the starry path , the viewer experiences a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of individual stars " , explained the association .	-6.1518
They also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star was more bright than another , even though it was far more distant .	-5.0228
Communicate also in which constellation is a selected star and when it is best to see .	-5.0379
The association has been operating the highest situated observatory in northern Germany since 2014 in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-4.3982
According to the Federal Environment Office , the site is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-4.1816
Often from there , the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with a mere eye can be seen .	-4.2711
In the unified city there has been something similar to the planetary path since 2003 on the initiative of the Federation Planetarium Göttingen .	-5.6241
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg leads up to Hainberg and the Observatory , as well as a " alien " site in Dimarden ( community of equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.4939

Mikey Garcia and Vasyl Lomé are meeting for the first time , discussing a possible showdown .	-3.0239
Vasyl Lomachenko and Mikey Garcia , who should be in a collision course to stage the most exciting boxing match in the near future under 14h<unk> , met for the first time on Thursday .	-5.7904

After Garcia 's victory by unanimous decision on the former four-divisional world champion Adrien Broner on Saturday at Showtime , both fighters are members of the top five Pould-for Poulard list .	-4.6559
Garcia stretched out the right hand and said : " How do you , Champion ?	-3.2275
I wish you good luck . '	-1.4218
Lomachenko defends his belt against Miguel Marriaga on Saturday night at 7 p.m. on the ESPN .	-4.2315
When the couple set up for photos , Lomachnoco Manager Egis Climate noticed that a possible showdown between the fighters would be the " perfect magnitude " .	-5.0743
" I am a former feather weight " , Garcia reminded .	-3.6295
" I went up for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-3.4577
I am small for 140 .	-0.8655
I would like to come down to light weight .	-1.9908
And he must move to lightweight weights [ 135 pounds ] and then fight .	-4.0387
That is what the fans are asking for .	-1.7838
Let us give them that . '	-1.3556
Mr Lomé was in agreement .	-3.4773
'Boxes need this fight ' .	-2.6901
Climate asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that has to fight Lombachenko with a 135-pound stake this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) , which also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell about their lightweight match in the Forum on 23 September .	-7.6240
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for him , " said Garcia and later openly expressed to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .	-4.8369
We are the best .	-0.7084
No other name can create this kind of attention .	-2.7149
Whenever they are ready ... "	-1.3609
Garcia said that he regarded Lomé as ' an enormous fighter ' and he may be taking part in his Saturday campaign .	-4.6809
But Lomé did hold on to the generous praise of Garcia and said that he think the three-fight champion from Riverside see " very slowly , I 'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted to co-out .	-7.1541
Garcia said that the focus is to show strength , then boxes .	-1.8429
Both said they could feel the momentum built for their own struggle .	-2.8735

Four Injured to tyre placement	-2.8952
In the event of an accident on the A7 , four people were partially injured on Thursday afternoon .	-2.1333
After initial information , the driver of a Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the port of Markenwide .	-7.9478
The passenger car drove to the right into the oblivion where it went overboard and then remained on the roof in the green strip .	-5.7620
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were in some cases seriously injured in the accident .	-2.0980
During the initial supply of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 to the north was closed for about one hour , and the road on the left was then crossed by the accident point .	-6.7696
Forgotten Hoffman : " Triskelette works better " .	-3.7594
After 2 : 2 in the season against Braunschweig , Andre Hoffmann hopes that the optimisation of the defensive information in Aue points will be achieved .	-6.4525
Andre Hoffmann was pleased with the first season , but the result would not have been the two opposing races at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-6.6327
" The two opposing points were too much , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says the defensive player of Fortuna Düsseldorf .	-5.5702
In the Ergebirge Mountains the trierkette should also be further optimized .	-4.6454
And a gate after a showdown does not want to capture the Fortunes .	-4.7645
" For the future , it will be the case that no one takes the line next to Michael ( Rending ) . "	-5.4777
Hoffmann is convinced that his team can handle even after the experience in the preparation with the trirette , rather than with the fourth chain .	-8.7977
" I don 't know how we will act in Aue yet , " says his trainer Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , " because we have half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann .	-5.8112
" It is essential , but that we improve our efforts and do not make so many mistakes in the construction " .	-7.8068
Of course Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-1.9042
" But whether you can talk about a failed start after an impolite start does not know .	-4.9936
The performance could be quite okay , " Hoffmann said .	-5.1181
" But if we can stand on Sunday with four points and focus on the Cup , we will certainly be able to talk about a proper seasonal pact . "	-4.9234
His trainer did not want to know anything about this .	-3.4346
" I only noticed the start of the season after six to eight days of playing , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of Saxony in Heidenheim had to be cancelled early due to bad weather .	-6.7115
" Now they can almost begin the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believed that the players from Aue might even be a bit more fresh , as they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a rising favorite in the bones .	-7.5167
" But they do not know as 100 % where they are now , " says the defense of the Fortuna .	-4.4827
While guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting in the finally ( almost ) finished stadium of Aube as a lighter favorite on Sunday .	-6.2661
" That we are throwing them away just because we have the right to come among the first six is stupid , " says Funkel , whose balance sheet is very positive with only a defeat against Aue from nine games .	-7.2045
" There is no team in the second Bundesliga that must be defeated from the start " , explains Fortunas 's Chief coach .	-4.9682
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant " .	-2.0534
And so Funkel will never see his players on Sunday .	-5.1153
Relating New Results of Sweden 's Asylum Age tests	-4.3029
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , subjected to a new method of medical evaluation of their age , show that more than 80 % of the people tested are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-4.3177
The Swedish authority for forensic medicine ( Rattlesssmandinalverket ) has begun to carry out the tests last year .	-6.8849
During the asylum procedure , they should make the assessment of the age more precise , after the Swedish immigration authority ( organisation of migration ) was criticised for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minor .	-8.6698
To this day , Migrangeet has sent 6.880 cases to be tested , and the forensic Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from the period from mid-March to 31st July 2017 .	-5.5028
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were assessed as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.1516
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.8028
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person 's age is called into question .	-2.6793
According to Johan Görsson of the forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-3.1862
" We don 't see a big difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are fairly constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-3.9538
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged as over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied about his age .	-3.5059
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there are 442 cases that ' propose that the studied person be 18 years or older ' .	-3.5571
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 published results , it found that in 243 of these cases , the person had openly said that they would be 18 years old this year .	-3.9939
The method of medical age assessment , in which X-ray inspection of wisdom teeth and MRT pictures of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-6.4278
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinka Institute , whose work includes assessing the biological maturity of humans to see whether they were previously or later usually through puberty .	-5.6456
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.8887
To judge biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-3.0527
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend we could , " he said to the newspaper Metro .	-3.4346
However , Görsson of the forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of misjudging a child as an adult is low .	-3.9371
The greatest risk is when the person is just under 18 , in which case this is about 10 % . '	-4.6567
Full in the Plan	-1.3542
Work on the three bridges of the Landstra<unk>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.7423
On Wednesday a 7 ton heavy concrete part was installed in the bridge at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.3331
" We are very good at the time , it is running super , " says Reinhold Leisch , head of construction at the department of road transport and the government headquarters Freiburg .	-5.6604
In April , work began at the same time on all three bridges in need of repair between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-3.6049
The end of the building is planned for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is adhered to .	-4.5502
The first bridge , coming from Schrammberg , leads through the " Trombach " .	-5.3024
It is a concrete vaulted vaulted vault bridge that is covered with red brick and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-5.7799
It was built in 1900 .	-0.9831
Like the other two bridges , it has now entered the years .	-3.4089
In order to ensure stability and traffic safety , the three buildings will now be thoroughly refurbished .	-4.3255
The other two bridges run above the Lauterbach .	-2.6868
They are made of red sandstone .	-2.7112
Both were built in 1939 and are 12 , or 10,60 meters long .	-3.1094
The bridge at Lauterbach ’ s entrance to the village has now received a 1,30 m wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap on the northern side on Wednesday morning .	-6.7919
This is a remote attachment which is also used as an operating route .	-4.7572
On Friday , the southern part of the bridge is planned to use a 2.20 meter wide bridge cap .	-5.5792
The pedestrian path is then to follow .	-4.3811
This is especially because they are finished parts , a patent of the Schrammberger company Dizwo .	-4.1250
The other two bridges are already covered by patented bridge caps .	-2.2418
A special touch of touch has required the installation of lines through the building in Lauterbach .	-5.8364
Because there is also a fiberglass cable to which many companies are connected .	-3.6756
The residents were informed about the project in advance of the work by a manual .	-4.7211
In addition , fish and cancer had to be caught .	-3.1279
Traffic is regulated by a traffic light for the bridges between the Bauhaus building building and the collective Christmas in the direction of Schramberg .	-6.7676
For construction works on the bridge at the Lauterbacher local entrance , the road in the area of the bridge at the height of the hotels " Tannhof " and " Seven Linden " is fully closed .	-5.5273
The cost of the three bridge adjustments amounts to EUR 700 000 , together . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.6325
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-2.2526
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest at German Potato Salat	-2.6068
After all , it is not so common that parties pull together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , it comes together , otherwise it is difficult to reconcile .	-5.1777
The parties represented in the Kreistag Volapeifel ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left ) belong to a broad alliance that this day shows peacefully flags , because the AfD in the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell invites to the placard " grand campaign event " .	-7.0570
And known names are coming to the start - like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the leader of the federal election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-6.5270
But those who are already hours before the event begins there do not want to listen to the AfD , but to demonstrate .	-5.2915
The motto ' The Eifel remains colorful ' .	-2.5987
Originally the town hall was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the Brunnenplatz , but it now takes place on the parking lot below the Rondells - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the Stadthalle .	-7.1598
A colourful image that offers you here .	-4.2514
And what Christa Karali , Chairman of the Forum One World and one of the relevant organizers , really pleased : " Be careful how many people have come together here " .	-5.4780
There is music and lots of food , including a " urdeutsche potato salad , which the AfD could eat easily " , says the woman who brought him .	-5.2194
The police have ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and they are also present at the station , which is only a few metres from the venues .	-6.9835
How did the AfD actually come on Gerolstein ?	-1.8581
Mario Hompes from the AfD Volcano reported that he tried and got an event like this .	-6.9645
The 45-year-old Görnersdorf had initially asked for a break in Daun , but there was a cancellation because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes there was not enough parking space .	-10.2271
Now the Rondell , Homepes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-4.1776
With a view to the event on Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.0231
There is also a volume of entertainment on the Rondellvorplatz at 20 o ’ clock , in the Stadthalle a number of speakers , including the rhin-arms AfD-CEO Uwe Jung .	-8.8052
There are about 200 people in the hall waiting for the top runner-up to be elected by the German parliament , Alice Weidel , and the deputy chairman Beatrix of Storch , to make their speeches .	-11.0914
The police presence has not changed , but officials have had a quiet evening so far .	-3.4833
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour , the guests on the front desk have a long breath , but there is also a lot of time to relax after 21 o 'clock .	-8.6443
The police can leave behind - no special events .	-3.2872
Posaune meets Trompete	-2.7537
There is a concert in the Haslacher Klosterkonzerte tomorrow , Sunday , at 8 p.m. in the monastery church .	-5.7203
Together with the Bulgarian trumpet Miroslav Petkov he gives a concert entitled " Black Sea meets Black Forest " , or even " Balkan Folklare " , a classical German training with roots in the Blasmusik .	-6.0085
Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in European top orchestras .	-3.6168
In this way , Petkov Solotrompeter is at the prestigious Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo chamber of the SWR symphony orchestra .	-5.6184
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the various genres .	-3.8557
This is how Johann Sebastian Bach plays at the two as well as in a new guise , Daniel Schnyders " Weltmusik " joins with Bulgarian folklore , and in the " Exchange Suite " of the Jazzechopreiter Nils Wogram , mix classical , jazz and free play into a fascinating overall art work .	-8.6003
This centrepiece of the program was only premiered this spring with enormous success in Freiburg .	-4.3042

Coe praises " honest " Russian apology for doping scandal	-1.9163
The world leader of track & field , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as a blatant apology from Russia for a Doping scandal , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be resumed in sport .	-4.5429
Russia ’ s track and field boss Dmitry Shylakhtin said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Championships that his country ’ s exile was correct from sport and that he was determined to fight doping .	-4.9197
He said he is sorry for " all athletes who won gold and silver medals at competitions " .	-3.0726
Despite its comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) had found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-3.5257
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.4032
" The entire Council and Congress were pleased that the Russian Federation itself recognised that it had some pretty hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is re-organised . "	-5.4099
Coe said that he was also ' pleased ' that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-2.7795
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but the Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the time to reinstate Russia , " said Coe .	-3.3462
" We have to do everything in the coming months to normalize this situation .	-3.5357
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the broken system , " he added .	-2.3381
Nineteen Russian athletes will be treated as neutral players at the World athletics Championships , which will start on Friday in London , following the rigorous IAAF criteria .	-5.7290

Sadly for soldiers who crashed in Mali	-3.0227
At a ceremony in the North Rhine fritzlar , about 1000 people thought of the two soldiers who died at a helicopter crash in Mali .	-5.9107
The ceremony took place on Thursday in the city of Domstadt under high security measures .	-7.3647
Defence Minister Ursula of the Leyen ( CDU ) said nothing about this ongoing crash .	-4.6347
She referred to the two incoming pilots as " the skills of her specialist " .	-5.0358
" We salute the highest sacrifice they have made on behalf of the Federal Republic of Germany " , she explained .	-4.0672
The 33-year-old Major and the 47-year-old Warshauptmann from Nordhessen died on Wednesday a week ago in the West African Mali .	-4.1153
Their coffins were transferred to Germany and brought to the Fritzlarer Dom Sankt Peter on Thursday .	-4.7545
At midday , only the family in the church took leave .	-4.1632
After that , the family 's funeral party , friends , representatives of the Bundeswehr and politics began .	-5.8247
This included Hesse 's Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the Chief Executive Officer of the German Army Volker Wieker .	-4.0383
Rose lay down , the relatives were in arms on the coffins .	-5.9676
In front of the church Fritzlarer and numerous soldiers walked the ceremony on a canvas .	-2.8193
Secretary of Defense of Leyen called the incoming soldiers " highly decorated " and subjected to action .	-3.8466
The Stachauptmann built the flight operations of the Tiger combat helicopter in Fritzlar and was one of the first six trained tiger pilots of his regime .	-5.0142
Similarly , Volker Bauersachs , commander of the regime to which the soldiers belong , said : ' If this occupation could not prevent the crash , no one could have avoided it ' .	-6.8028
Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not reveal Minister of Leyen : deployment is dangerous .	-4.7748
But he is also very important ' for a country from which we are separated only by two states ' , she said .	-4.5152
After the ceremony of mourning , the coffins were taken from the cathedral .	-3.5026
When and where they are being buried , the Bundeswehr did not provide information .	-4.7919
Prince Henrik does not want a tomb next to his wife .	-1.8948
The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-3.1887
This divided the royal house on Thursday .	-2.0340
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral church of Roskilde .	-2.4338
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard already made a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.0784
The queen was in agreement with her husband 's decision , she was further stated in the communication .	-4.7277
Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is still unclear .	-1.3608
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-2.8593
Prince Henrik never made a secret of his failure to be happy with his title .	-3.3213
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would like to have become king .	-4.0380
He retired in 2016 , leaving the title " Princemanl " .	-5.1651
As Henrik did not get the title and the function he wanted in Denmark , he did not regard himself as equal to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the head of the Danish Royal House .	-6.7596
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be , is still unclear .	-3.7501
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.6257
He likes the country for which he has worked over the last 50 years .	-2.0572
The native Henri de Laborde de Monpezat , the son of a French nobleman , had met Margrethe in London in 1965 .	-3.1715
He worked on the theme in the French Embassy .	-2.4980
During his later wife , Prince Henrik served with the Danes in a difficult position .	-6.1666
In a autobiography , Henrik said about the first years in Denmark : " A few months after my arrival , everything I did was criticised .	-3.9871
My Danish was fluctuating , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk socks instead of knitting , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-4.1752
Even for the Gauloises , which I used to smoke instead of Virgin tobacco and which had the reputation of being the brand of socializing critical intellectuals in this country , I could not hope for indulgence .	-8.4625
I was different .	-0.9788
I seemed to be satisfied with this position and not ashamed .	-2.6723

Prime Minister Weil wants quick new elections	-3.5527
CDU and FDP versus the possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.9604
Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red-green government majority , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the land day , but he does not want to resign .	-5.6519
Because it was on Friday that Parliament was dissolved .	-4.1492
Previously , the surprising departure of a Green MEP from her country assembly in Lower Saxony brought the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-5.0049
Five months before the official state election date , the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its narrow one-vote majority in parliament to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.9550
The former Green MEP Elke twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the election in 2018 in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wüste ) .	-5.0552
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she said on Friday in Hanover .	-2.5378
CDU Chairman Björn Thümler would recommend that his group should accept them .	-4.6481
The CDU and the FDP together would have 69 seats in the Lower Saxony parliament , the SPD and the Greens ’ 68 seats .	-4.5221
So far , the ratio has been the other way round .	-2.2385
The new country day will be regularly elected on 14 January next year .	-4.2580
Thümler said that the red-green government must now decide whether it could continue to govern in this situation without a majority .	-3.4381
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the day of land be resolved as quickly as possible .	-5.5993
The CDU Group is expected to decide on how to proceed on Tuesday .	-2.7222
The constitution also provides for the opportunity for the Prime Minister to regain trust and elect a successor .	-4.8775
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.3606
These opportunities must be properly examined by law , " said Thümler .	-4.8236
'Everyone will discuss all questions in peace if they are legally sound . '	-5.6021
Thümler called Twig step " but a bit curious " .	-4.7347
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-1.9461
I feel very good ' .	-1.6317
She called herself a lady of the black green .	-4.1346
The Greens called on the breakaway Members to return their country 's mandate .	-4.4788
" We assume , of course , that they will return with immediate effect their Landtagssmandate , which she has received via the green national list , " said the President of the country , Meta Janssen , and Stefan Körner .	-8.6579
The Chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Anja Piel , said : ' We regret the decision taken by Elke twesten . '	-4.9311
You have deliberately decided not to hold a debate in the group .	-2.6779
" Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . "	-4.6655
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the violation of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke twesten to the CDU as a betrayal .	-5.1254
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only a betrayal of the voters , but also a betrayal of the red green , " the Social Democrat chief wrote on Facebook on Friday .	-5.2351
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to let the country ’ s day be re-elected quickly .	-4.3446
Rot-Grün in Lower Saxony costs the majority .	-3.7705
The political activist " in her injured vanity and in her frustrations her personal interests in front of the welfare of the country " , criticized SPD-Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-5.4026
" It is a scandal that the CDU in Lower Saxony is taking part in this filthy incontrovertible game and trying to capitalize on it " .	-5.8208
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader Björn Thümler wants to recommend to his fellow Members that Elke twesten be admitted to the CDU .	-7.1196
Thomas Oppermann , Head of the SPD in the Bundestag , designed twesten to falsify the outcome of the country ’ s election in 2013 with personal careers .	-8.0962
The CDU was in front of the SPD ’ s strongest force , but the SPD and the Greens had a terribly thin majority of one vote in the country ’ s day .	-6.5671
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from toxic eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.3700
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.8854
How did the scandal happen ?	-1.7326
How can consumers protect themselves .	-1.1753
Agriculture Minister Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is speaking and responding in an interview with the German editorial network ( RCD ) .	-4.8872
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-2.4652
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in their refrigerator and check the stamp .	-3.2507
On the Consumer Protection Portal www.Food Warnung.de , the federal states provide the latest information about the respective egg charters .	-7.7547
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.3102
Even if , after everything we know at the moment , health risks are practically excluded .	-4.2547
Is Aldi now experiencing the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of the offer - because the central role of the Federal Minister of Economy is not really perceived ?	-5.4775
Food monitoring is the job of the Federal States .	-2.7300
Nevertheless , my house has been on the rise immediately and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since its acquaintance .	-8.6601
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.5071
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are safe and safe for health .	-4.4433
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs , they are not transportable .	-4.3657
However , contaminated eggs can be sold and eaten .	-2.4462
This time it is not businesses that are to blame .	-2.2406
Is sitting at production plants and consumers in the same boat ?	-3.4714
According to current knowledge , production operations are not directly at fault .	-4.7800
Instead , they must reckon with economic damage due to the alleged illegal practices of service companies .	-4.0445
As always , there are too few inspectors in the worst case .	-2.5959
Is it only a matter of personnel or of competence that is consistent ?	-5.4878
It was the official controls that revealed the procedure .	-4.0237
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy can never be 100 % excluded .	-2.7600
It is precisely for this reason that consistent information on such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor is crucial in cases where criminal offences can be committed .	-6.6067
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the responsible authorities .	-3.1410
Is regular alarmism really necessary in food scandals ?	-2.9645
Consumers have the right to receive only safe and affordable food .	-3.4221
If an unapproved insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are right to be outraged .	-2.9750
The wrong way to get manufacturers , dealers and consumers into a situation that is absolutely not necessary .	-5.9368
Basically , it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticides fipronil in the attitude of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be brought to an end without delay .	-4.5896
This must be done consistently and with great pressure at all levels .	-3.5513
I expect all the competent authorities to prompt and clear up the facts .	-4.2689
The impact of football ’ s financial rules on Neimars ’ move to Paris .	-5.1680
The rules aimed at preventing unrestricted spending by European football clubs will not interfere with the Spanish Barcelona World Bank transfer to the French Paris-Saint Germain .	-6.0577
Some of the consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of UEFA , because the executive organization that monitored the European game has the power to prohibit teams from accessing the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-5.5803
Financial Fair-lay rules , which were created by UEFA in 2011 , mean that at some point PSG must prove that the Nemar transfer was financed without any major losses .	-6.0026
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to buy out Brazilian people from its contract and Nemar will receive a salary that will amount to tens of millions of dollars a year .	-4.6726
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neims move to France .	-3.0422
PSG can certainly free money so that Nemar underwrites and brings him to a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar .	-7.0476
clubs may spend a lot of money on the acquisition of players , but must deal with legitimate sources of revenue that enable them to reach the break-even point in their football business .	-5.9822
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election as UEFA president in 2007 .	-4.6927
The former French player believed that clubs who had incurred huge debts in their pursuit of success would effectively cheat and risk ruin if banks or owners withdrew their support .	-5.6684
In 2011 , FFP shifted from concentration on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.7207
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovivich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a harsher matter .	-5.0189
During the current three-year FFP pre-election period that runs until 2018 , clubs may suffer losses of EUR 30 million .	-4.7644
And while Plathi fell into disfavor from the presidency in 2015 , UEFA ’ s successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to push for excessive spending .	-4.7823
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traversa , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.4661
Although the MG paid for the Nemar buy-out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for the billing throughout the duration of its contract .	-6.3966
Nemar has signed a five-year contract so that the annual financial statements for the next five years can be recorded in the annual accounts of EUR 44.4 million .	-5.4587
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , which is owned by Manchester City , hit the hardest .	-3.4726
The PSG received a fine of € 60 million ( $ 82 million at that time ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and was ordered to keep the team members limited to 21 players for the 2014 / 15 Summer Championship League instead of the normal 25 players .	-7.0049
UEFA is looking for clubs to try to roll out their financial supervision by inflating their revenues by companies associated with the owners of a club .	-5.8443
While a Hungarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship exceeded the standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .	-5.7608
That was what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of the PSN sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.7009
It has been reported that some of the G8 payments at Nemar could come to Qatar in 2022 .	-4.9374
But the PSG and Qatar in 2022 denied that Nemar became World Cup ambassadors and that such a maneuver could simply be found for the UEFA regulators .	-5.1179
The previous sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-3.4524
The UEFA had no preliminary talks with the PSG on Neims Transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-5.6229
They spoke on condition of anonymity with The Associated Press because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.3792
The latest published reports show that , with a turnover of EUR 542.4 million , the PSG 2015 / 16 has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 .	-4.0379
The accounts for the last fiscal year must be published .	-2.4639
The German Post Office has announced that Nemars ’ arrival is a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising and product sales .	-7.7848
The association assumes that sales will increase by at least 30 percent after the signing .	-3.5025
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and it tried to prevent Nemars ’ move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-5.0943
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state " , said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily newspaper AS concerning catars of the ultimate ownership of PSG .	-4.8595
Arsenal-Manager Arsene Wenger , whose club is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-3.9120
" It is the consequence of ownership and this has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years " , Wenger said on Thursday .	-3.5387
" As soon as a country has an association , everything is possible .	-2.8772
It will be very difficult to respect financial fair play because you can go down different paths or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-4.6741

Swiss-Prescherin Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper " North-West Switzerland " of Friday .	-4.5202
According to current planning , the airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-3.3081

Nostalgie goes into " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " into the niche .	-3.0124
This repetition of history is also nostalgic for the glorious days of characters of the 80 ’ s , for the 90 ’ s Grunge era ( when the preeminent David Wain and Michael Showage turned the SketchUp comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Pohler and Paul Rudd , went to bigger things .	-6.1753
As a cultural artefact , it is both a parody and a embodiment of our Facebook era of permanent memories .	-2.5661
But as a franchise it feels like time would be short .	-2.3726
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking can vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.4623
By hiding at the heart of the gag - medium age actors play horny children who will grow up - they still found it impossible to win back the last part of the joke .	-6.7550
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted , and his parody goes more to the watering principle , including a riff on the stalker film of the 1990s as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The Hand that Fools the Cradle " ) .	-6.9897
At one point , an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " are still under way .	-5.2022
Many of the central stories are the same .	-0.8717
The amiable Coop ( Mr. Showage ) , now novelist , Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) has still not forgotten .	-3.1710
Victor ( Ken Marino ) has still not lost his virginity .	-1.5696
And there is another crazy malignant plot that Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showage ) is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a very successful impression by Michael Ian Black ) .	-5.5747
As always , the excursion is the best part of a franchise .	-2.2117
It 's a lot of fun to see the eternally young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillons 's subliment of " Singles " , whose former Big man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old boy .	-6.8657
It is the moments of accidental madness that this franchise could fuel like a kind of repeated " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I assume as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twentty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the bands how they will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-5.4420
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americas " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East-West battle iconography .	-4.2394
The comedy with Rhys Thomas , created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , as director , indicates a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest fighting for truth , Athismus and the way of Marxism / Leninism .	-8.3581
The main roles are played by Florian Piersic Jr. and Cornelius Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized in English by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt .	-3.7227
It is a brilliant idea .	-1.0179
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.4732
There are some nice gags about standing ( the police spends time viewing chess on television , as Americans might do with football ) .	-4.0280
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - provides for a decent game ' Find the voice ' .	-4.2433
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truthfulness of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who carries a Reagan mask is included - that it often plays like a single .	-4.1205
With six long episodes it 's going to happen , and the comedy is not fast or frequent enough .	-6.2805
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited to a lesser length , could provide its agility treatment better , as Gregor and Iosaf regularly visit the American Embassy , whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men wearing a pile of hamburgers .	-7.7067
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything feed for a vow .	-3.6335
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong : we are doing it with our own recent history and theirs .	-2.8935
Germany ’ s Drug Mafia	-2.6111
The police managed to hit the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.1224
On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were discovered in the Schwarzwald-Pfeil , Rottweeil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor Konstanz announced on Friday .	-4.9495
15 of them were arrested at the age of 25 to 77 and arrest warrants were already issued against them .	-4.5620
In addition , officials ensured larger amounts of marijuana and cocaine , guns and several hundred thousand euros .	-3.1894
Two people were arrested at the same time in Italy .	-2.6256
German arrest warrants were issued against the two suspects Italians .	-1.7903
The two are therefore presumably shipped to Germany .	-2.8338
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-1.8749
More than 300 police officers were in operation .	-2.8134
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised crime , violent acts of violence , attempted murder , robbery and blackmail .	-4.5646
Since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office has been investigating Konstanz against organised drug trafficking in the southern German region .	-3.8926
Between the Public Prosecutor 's offices in Konstanz and Palermo there was a constant exchange and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.6498
For this reason , four officials from Palermo accompanied the large-scale deployment on Wednesday morning .	-5.2562
In particular , Italian citizens were targeted at the investigation , with close links with the Italian mafia .	-5.0075
An incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , should also go to the gang 's account .	-5.4087
Ripping large gaps in the country register	-4.2219
'Citizens ' data that should not be published ' : according to a report , the country register in Germany has serious shortcomings .	-5.2465
This leads to some serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.6301
According to a media report , the German Federal Government representative for the management of refugees drew attention to large gaps in the country register .	-6.3473
Defects in the data registered there could lead to some serious misdecisions in the case of asylum procedures and deportation proceedings , in a way that the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' has been analysed .	-7.3560
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are included , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.1395
The data is thus managed by around 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.3314
Because the data had not been sufficiently maintained , data quality in some parts has not been good .	-4.7423
In individual cases , data was found in 1921 , ' by people who have long since ceased to live , or by citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register ' .	-5.0083
" Error data inputs can slow return processes considerably " , says the report further .	-5.1060
Moreover , statistics on people liable to travel abroad include EU citizens who do not have to travel .	-5.4302
Such wrong suits , however , " led to a distorted debate on how to deal with travel agents " , so it is written in the analysis . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.7966
In the meantime , the Federal Government seems to have begun sending refugee families with children under 16 years of age back to Italy when they have arrived there .	-5.2355
This emerges from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the New Osnabrück Newspaper .	-4.4648
Thus , the paper states that the BAMF is re-conducting such procedures ' for families with children - with the exception of babies and children - after Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-6.8772
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , as the newspaper points out the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.0404
Under the Dublin Agreement , the EU State ’ s refugees are responsible for the first time .	-5.2004
If an immigrant travels to another EU country , that state can send him back to the country of entry .	-3.9961
To put it , the office now reads : ' Meanwhile , the capacity for families with minors has increased substantially in Italy ' .	-6.7804
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-3.0616
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) regards these commitments as sufficient .	-2.5614
Other EU countries would also send refugees back there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.6411
This decision was criticised by the left-wing group , Ulla Jelpke , who said : ' Families with children are threatened by the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system in terms of human illegal reception conditions and a threat to children 's well-being ' .	-8.4923
Two best results achieved	-4.6126
A total of 220 litres of blood of persons living in Oberreichenbach have already been provided for other people .	-5.4267
At least of the twelve citizens awarded on Friday .	-2.6662
Jürgen Greule , who with his 100 donations now divided 50 litres of blood .	-5.2670
Traditionally , in the council ’ s meeting , the community attaches a great deal of willingness to donate blood .	-6.1433
" It is brilliant how our body is designed for this and we pay attention to the donors who provide their blood for strangers for it " , underlined Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-6.1740
" A single donation helps several people " , explained by the director of the German Red Cross ( DRC ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the preservers are divided into their components .	-5.8163
Three people could benefit from blood donation .	-2.5007
At the same time , Maienbacher reported about the actions that will be carried out in Oberrichenbach in spring .	-4.5533
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK director .	-2.8509
Obviously , the change to the theatre house a few years ago led to higher participation figures .	-4.3694
Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umberer were among the multiple donors and received 50 blood donations .	-5.2215
Halfway so many conclude Herbert Mair and Dorothee Rixinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter ten ten times each 500 millilitres of their life juice .	-4.9893
The Bank of England will hold interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.0286
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , as weak economic growth and weak inflation have slowed down speculation about rising .	-4.4129
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain “ sluggish ” when it maintained interest rates on family income in the middle of a rising pressure .	-4.5116
The Bank ’ s Monetary Committee ( MPC ) leaders voted 6 to 2 to keep interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members rising this month , as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .	-4.7098
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts for 2017 to 1.7 % , and to 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that pressure on household income would continue , with inflation expected to rise to close to 3 % in the autumn .	-6.4464
But they signaled that interest increases would be needed in the next few years to rein in Brexit inflation , and she said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.3965
Members also voted to withdraw part of the Mammut Protocol package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-4.5418
It will call for time for the financing plan to provide cheaper financial resources to banks as of next February , although it has been said that it will now be expected to provide <unk> 15 billion more under this system - with GBP 115 billion dying .	-5.9995
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the MPC ’ s central forecast , GDP remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on real household incomes continues to weigh consumption . '	-5.8153
At interest rates , they repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be required to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' level than markets would expect .	-4.1463
The markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-3.2697
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-3.0218
The Bank ’ s top-down growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-5.7612
It has maintained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.2565
The pound fell on these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.7771
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.3227
The decision to change does not come after recent disappointing growth rates have dampened rising expectations for a rate hike , and GDP increased from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-5.5313
Growth is expected to reach 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will easily recover after the bank at the end of the year .	-4.1526
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor wage increases , as tightening will first become even worse before improving .	-5.3054
She added that monetary policy will not ' prevent the collapse of income ' in the next few years , but she added that wages will ' recover significantly ' at the end of their three-year ambitions .	-7.0894
The economy will also be strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , owing to a weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-3.6741
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August following the shocking EU vote caused by the pound ’ s decline .	-3.2829
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years before it will fully reach prices and the economy .	-3.7952
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates had increased , as inflation pushed the pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-5.4590
Inflation has fallen from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % last month , although the Bank has said that this was expected and will attract it again in the coming months .	-4.6145
The Bank said that the excess in ratio to its 2 % target was " quite " to the weak pound .	-5.2889
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " In the light of the recent drop in Swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as creditors are clamouring for business and wish to end the year in a positive way .	-5.7068
The market is particularly good for those who end the existing deals and end the new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-4.8628
NHS ( The National Health Service ) is alleged to prescribe a controversial HIV drug to 10,000 people .	-4.0194
Patients will be given access to a " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after the High Court fight against the financing of the drug in the NHS .	-5.8539
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now provided by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-6.0629
He agreed to finance the process after last year ’ s appeal court upheld a ruling by the Supreme Court that the NHS had the power to pay for the EP despite the claim that local authorities should fund it .	-4.7248
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England boss Simon Stevens as ' major new intervention ' , while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this a ' decisive moment ' .	-3.8213
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool , Sheffield and Sheffield will be among the first to allow people to register , and further clinics will follow in October before they will be introduced across England in April 2018 .	-4.6957
Preventive prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.3751
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission when infection is at risk .	-3.2962
Taking PrEP before intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person ’ s body to prevent HIV infection .	-2.9886
Such drugs can be taken every day or so two hours before intercourse .	-2.7244
Those who are eligible for treatment are gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and people with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.5852
clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals , who have a partner whose HIV status is not famously controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.7046
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for a possible participation in their local sexual clinic .	-10.6876
The program will be <unk> 10 million and NHS England signed a contract for the supply of drugs this week after an international competitive procurement .	-3.5338
The study aims to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as used , recorded , and implemented on a large scale .	-6.0395
Stevens said : ' This great new intervention should complement and exceed the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-3.1577
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in addressing one of humanity ’ s greatest health challenges . ”	-5.0847
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National AIDS Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.9575
PrEP , when targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , can change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.5747
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-funded attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is genuinely controlled individually and is not subject to negotiation with a partner , leading to an improvement of many lives .	-5.8528
We warmly welcome this announcement . '	-1.8186
Ian Green , the chairman of Terence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be to speed up the study throughout the country and leave no one at risk of HIV .	-7.0570
Now that the PrEP test medicine has been obtained , we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 people infected with HIV . '	-3.7211
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : ' The start of the EP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and sluggish government implementation .	-3.8410
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and can end the transfer of this life-saving infection .	-3.0281
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the advantages of PrEP .	-2.3708
It is now important that this study should be carried out as soon as possible in the whole country to protect people who are HIV infected and that it will contribute to bringing us a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . '	-6.4674
Living the great life : in-between floors and clever designer tricks have transformed this little Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-3.9047
Jeanne Leigh , a former real estate banker with a passion for real estate , fell from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earl 's Court apartment in 2014 .	-3.9103
It is situated on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Jeanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-5.8341
" Before I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room " , says Jeanne .	-3.7253
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-1.4041
I saw this apartment in Earls Court , and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.3408
I fell in love with her and made an offer this day . '	-1.9779
Since the first visit the 1,000 square foot apartment has been completely outdated .	-3.8915
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get to the bedroom - you wanted to add a closet space and an intermediate level to make the most of the spacious ceiling .	-6.1372
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , plenty of light .	-1.9796
That was my request ' she says .	-1.2333
To this end , she commissioned Erfan Azadi ’ s architectural and design studio Duck & Shed from Notting Hill to use 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Jeanne .	-5.0503
The ceiling was not large enough to place two spaces on top , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level in which one could stand .	-3.6794
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-2.5714
" The steelworks are rather complicated " , he explains .	-2.4993
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked on top of each other without us having to pay .	-4.8657
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of establishing the steel in such a way that it had the correct height for the function above or below . '	-4.9073
This arrangement enabled Erfan to place two spaces at the same height - with a lot of additional drama .	-5.4023
For the intermediate level a classical copper window of retro looks down over the glamorous living area .	-4.9225
Keyed gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.5400
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatres , space and light .	-1.7664
At both ends a short corridor is mirrored to make it work longer .	-2.9123
In the kitchen , the reflection feels like a window in another room .	-3.0833
Coated units at the entrance can accommodate all the cutlery and glasses of Joanne .	-5.6455
With the appearance of a glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close if not used . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.4470
Comforted kitchens are nothing new .	-3.0873
The special thing about this is that it is a garage .	-2.6468
" A bit of engineering art went in , " explains Erfan of the steel reinforced MDF door .	-3.8585
'It is weighty so that when you push the door it is very easy to track ' .	-5.4147
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne was able to win an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.9925
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is estimated " , says Erfan .	-3.3405
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and calculate based on the ground size . "	-4.5296
They have made it possible to enlarge the floor while at the same time using high-quality materials that give the room a luxurious advantage .	-6.4007
" The materials are the things you touch and that therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.3451
" You don 't fall into the electrical sockets in the walls .	-2.4802
They are important , but they do not play with your heart ' .	-2.5274
It shows that an apartment can be transformed by good design and increased square meters from something standard to something really amazing .	-4.2547
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.8391
brothers are fighting for a $ 500 million real estate empire	-2.5038
Two brothers , four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , are in dispute over one of the largest property empires of Victorian worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.4655
The former director of the ' Carlton-Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and business assets are to be shared .	-5.3110
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-5.2239
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers have collected 38 properties worth more than half a billion dollars , since the 1973 family bought a store in Smith Street , Collingwood .	-2.7855
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-2.8566
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.2467
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the town centre , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt . Buller as well as shopping centers in the suburban area .	-5.0756
After an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " main operator and dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul about one-third .	-5.5078
A court act says that this means that Colin has $ 316 million worth of ownership and Paul has $ 176 million .	-4.5593
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-3.2661
" The divisions proposed by Colin have left him with what I thought for the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidvit .	-2.7389
Last Friday , following several failed mediation , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.3835
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - of which Colin , as Paul claims , ruled out .	-4.9666
Colin argues that this is not true , but that Paul prefers to administer some properties incompetent .	-3.7035
In an early affidit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to resolve the argument .	-4.3486
" My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority " , he wrote .	-2.3271
The costs are rising in the case , with hundreds of websites with Affidvits , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Keck Cramer Charter , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-4.5047
Mrs De Luttis and her husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated dairy bars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick during the early 1970s .	-4.7412
They used the security to buy the Collingwood Estate , where Colin opened the first jeans store of the family .	-5.0868
Colin says that he began Westco there when he was " in my last years the High School , when Paul was a little child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.7553
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to share their property with their sons .	-3.4504
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to go to court , " she wrote .	-2.5578
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Luttis group , with Colin claiming that when leaving the company , Mark was paid $ 10 million and Luke $ 26 million .	-4.3120
Both Lukas and Mark are said to have " become weathered by the conditions of their financial division " .	-4.4039
Colin came back , though he was a former AFL member of the board and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars .	-7.3612
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.9003
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I can really not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.3143
" It is very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and to pull our family name through the courts " he wrote .	-4.2230
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the court that he had tried to fulfill his brother ’ s demands .	-3.3855
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current row , " he said and added that he " still hope for a solution " .	-4.0343
On Friday , that hope seemed over .	-2.5887
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.4959
Trump ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-1.8963
Others tried and failed .	-1.3552
Perhaps John F. Kelly can do it .	-1.7881
If so , he will be the first .	-0.8472
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including the news media reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on an equal course .	-4.3173
Here is a piece of reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.2885
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met senior officers on his first working day , he presented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that comes into the hands of the president .	-4.2403
Kelly told the staff that information about him should go - whether on paper or in briefings - because the President would make better choices if he had good information . '	-4.1982
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media integrity .	-3.5761
President Trump ’ s relationship with television dates back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.8214
" If candidate Trump was angry about unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting from those who were convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg in February against Politico .	-5.2566
Politos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that ' the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes a steady price of praise ' .	-5.0392
Okay .	-0.8415
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit has ever been " under control " is ridiculous .	-2.3469
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know to others - that without their interventions , Trump ’ s tweets would have included even more fuel .	-5.0099
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-2.1438
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble several times , their efforts paid off .	-4.3083
But no one has been able to consistently prevent Trump from being controversial .	-2.6313
Part of the problem is that people in a White House made up of competing parties always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.1099
In May , Politico - quite preoccupied with this history - reported that consultants ' penchant for providing dubious information to the President for strategic reasons .	-7.2878
This was an example described by reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.8733
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clippings , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is hard to find out where they come from .	-5.1833
That is what happened at the end of February , when someone in bad faith gave the President a printed copy of an article of GotNews.com , the website of Internet provocateurs Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief , Katie Walsh , of being " the source behind a heap of leaks " in the White House .	-5.8416
Although Johnson has been banned permanently from Twitter for harassment , or has offered no concrete evidence , or has , in the past , made false allegations and revoked them .	-5.3228
Trump read the article and started to ask people about Walsh . '	-3.2168
Goldmacher added that the then chief of staff , Reince Pribus , and the Secretary General of the White House , Rob Porter , have attempted to implement a system to manage and document the paperwork Trump receives .	-4.0541
How did that happen ?	-1.7684
Kelly is three months later trying to do the same .	-2.9948
Perhaps he will prove to be the most effective manager in the Pribus , but Trump is still his impulsive Self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-4.0330
These persistent factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-2.5848

Travelers negotiate a ditch and return to the ' Millions-Series ' .	-2.6176
Some of the wealthiest house owners of the West Midlands are back on war with some determined travelers who have negotiated a ditch from the village to claim a field in front of their mansions .	-7.1348
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans on a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the " Millions-series " .	-5.6818
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters , after being dropped out in May , without being deterred from a ditch dug out by the Council to prevent their incursions .	-6.0262

An anonymous resident said : " They are pulled there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-4.0703
The Council must be forced to implement it through shame , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.4649
Travellers were there in May , moved forward and are now back .	-2.7230
More came yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-2.9239
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long briefs to protect its parks .	-4.2420
I live on Streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.8663
A non-native said : " It is ridiculous , we have just seen the last round of these travelers just to be ploughed by another round .	-4.3198
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the park area . '	-2.9915
A speaker from the Solihull Council said : " We are aware of an unauthorized camp on the country beyond the Streetbrook Road and work with the Soliihulls police .	-7.0797
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-2.9954
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court will have to consider when we will present our case ' .	-5.1824
Waldhotel Luise from Birkenhof	-2.5758
The Waldhotel Luise is from the former Hotel Birkenhof .	-3.0991
The house at the gates of Freudidstadt is being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.7932
These are good news for the city .	-1.3790
After all , with the closure of the Birkenhof Hotel by the former Ambiente Betriebgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and revenue was also lost by the spa tax .	-6.7412
In the autumn of 2014 , the hotel building was offered to the Land Council as a collective accommodation , giving controversial discussions , given the dramatic increase in the numbers of refugees entering the district . , , , , and the , , , , and .	-10.5931
The city prevented asylum seekers from being accommodated by drawing up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.1514
The decision at the time was not undisputed in the local council .	-3.8294
But above all Freudstadts Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and spoke of serious visitors at the time .	-5.9809
He should be right .	-1.1722
The Luisenhotels group with managing director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and will again make it a house of three star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-5.5949
The group has four houses with the object of joy .	-2.7812
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalba .	-2.4496
The hotel is located in the centre of Luise .	-7.1188
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it will be clear what extensive renovations are going on .	-6.6923
The floors were torn out , some blankets were dismantled and old bathtubs were removed from the rooms .	-3.9084
The whole hotel building is a single construction site .	-2.9255
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.9694
" It is actually a beautiful hotel " , says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-3.0662
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.5693
The rooms are equipped with large walk-in showers , the entrance is changed and new windows are added .	-4.5327
Everything should become " beautiful to the citizen " later , as Thomas Scherer says .	-4.2820
" We want to make a jewelry out of it " .	-3.7204
Swimming pool , spa area and meeting room are also available .	-4.6025
Scherer pointed out that he was not at the high level of the hotels in Lauterbad .	-12.0483
Waldhotel Luise , with its 60 rooms , wants to spread , explains Scherer .	-4.2980
Both individual holidaymakers , groups and business people should feel at ease in the hotel .	-4.9590
Talk to OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause already , so Scherer .	-3.8341
The sights of the city are equal to those of the hotel group .	-3.5021
'We are on the same line ' .	-1.2100
When it comes to the level of investment , Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific .	-4.0545
Just under one million euros , he expects .	-3.6621
The outdoor facilities are also brought to the front , which is already clear .	-5.7077
A large terrace is created in an inner courtyard , which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is public .	-4.6059
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudienstadt is a good market " .	-2.3912
Russia affair : US Special Counsel sets Grand Jury .	-4.5869
In the Russian affair for US President Donald Trump , Special Counsel Robert Mueller is alleged to have appointed a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.8823
The body has been working in recent weeks , writing the Wall Street Journal , calling on familiar people .	-4.9428
The newspaper valued the move as a sign that Mueller expanded and intensified his investigations .	-3.6089
The CNN channel reported that there are already the body ’ s first subpoenas associated with a meeting between Trump ’ s eldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-4.5915
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of being specifically involved in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-2.6771
Mueller is investigating whether there have been arrangements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-3.2094
The investigation aims to focus on several men who campaigned as a Republican advisor .	-4.4260
reportedly , Mueller also looked at more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.9662
A few weeks ago , the Washington Post wrote that the special counsel had personally brought Trump to the centre and argued that the president might have obstructed justice in the course of the case .	-6.2789
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine present evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to charge .	-4.5726
Grand Jurys are therefore called " Prisoners " .	-4.8531
They are also turned on when they are larger and controversial cases .	-3.1046
The procedure is always conducted behind closed doors .	-2.0812
The board can also be used by the Public Prosecutor to charge persons for interrogation under oath .	-5.1570
According to CNN , outlets have already been posted about meeting Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-4.5247
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement in the report .	-3.5640
They should also provide documents .	-1.1303
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s advisors and son-in-law , Jared Kushner , as well as his past campaign leader , Paul Manafort , were in the conversation .	-5.1596
Legal experts said on US television on Thursday evening that he showed that Mueller was not intimidated in his work and that he wanted to act quickly if necessary .	-4.9356
However , it should not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be activated in the end to decide on the prosecution .	-5.5421
Nevertheless , setting up the body of the start of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern to President Trump . include , , , , , , , , , , , , and the .	-6.6293
In the midst of the new revelations , the President used a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Rusland affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.3500
" Russia 's history is a complete invention , " said Trump .	-2.1117
The subject gives the democrats a way to ' feel good , because they have nothing else they can talk about ' .	-3.7238
His special advisor Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing about the creation of a Grand Jury .	-3.6244
But they usually work in secret , he emphasized .	-4.0535
The White House is in favour of any measures which have accelerated the work of the Special Director in a ' fair ' way .	-5.3438
Former FBI Chairman James Comey said three times that the president was not determined .	-3.4563
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , the statement continued .	-5.9517
But Mueller was only used after Trump fired Comey .	-2.4721
Because of this hurdle , accusations against Trump were made that he wanted to obstruct the judiciary .	-5.3583
In June , Comey told a Senate committee that Trump asked him to stop investigations against then-national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-3.3252
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-2.7741
Following the presentation of US media , the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and its employees .	-3.9522
This prompted speculation about whether Trump would dismiss Mueller .	-3.6712
Unlike an independent congressional envoy , such as the Watergate affair over the late President , Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which , in theory , he could be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the behest of the president .	-5.2190
Several senators from both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.9158
Two groups of Republican and Democratic Senators tabled a bill on Thursday that the special counsel could no longer be dismissed so easily .	-5.2230
Antarctica : Gigantischer Eisberg is driving Antarctica	-1.9054
A giant iceberg of nearly seven times the size of Berlin has resolved itself from the Shelfeus .	-7.9903
This included the Bremerhavener Alfredo Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-4.4059
More than a trillion tons of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of pistol are now going north and will probably need two or three years before it has been melted .	-6.6374
It is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades , with a length of 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-4.3670
He does not pose a threat to people .	-4.3339
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear according to research data .	-4.2311
However , for some 30 years , there has been a series of unusual eruptions of ice snouts in the region , the US Research Center for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) writes in a factual background .	-6.4382
Many researchers believe that this can be related to global warming .	-3.1157
The now broken piston has been part of the Larsen C-Schelfeis .	-3.3456
The lake is bathed by large glaciers .	-3.5373
As a result , it continues to grow into the sea and breaks regularly .	-4.0402
The Larsen Schelfeis is situated south of South America near the tip of the Antarctic peninsula .	-4.4938
To the north , this horseshoe had upset the balance of growth and breakdowns a few years ago .	-5.4674
A complete cheque is broken down , says AWI researcher Daniela Jansen .	-5.8090
There is much to be said that the Larsen C-Schelfeis is in danger , because the front edge has never been so far removed as it is now .	-6.5092
In addition , the ice plate is running and can collapse if a piece breaks off at a key point .	-6.5813
Melting of Shelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea levels , as they swim on the water and supple ice as much water as it produces after melting itself .	-6.1682
However , the loss of the Schelfeuses means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow much faster than before .	-5.1944
This may increase sea levels , but only slightly so , writes the UK research project to observe the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.7712
According to AWI , the Larsen C-Schelfeis , with almost 50 000 square kilometres , is the fourth largest cyclone in the Antarctic .	-5.1082
It is up to 700 meters thick on the pass from the mainland , at the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-6.5985
It regularly breaks out there .	-3.0016
" Although it is a natural event and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the Ice Shield is now in a more dangerous position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.7825
" This is the longest retreat since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.8618
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen C-Schelfeis will grow again or go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-6.4104
But this development will take decades .	-2.0027
Although these researchers do not reduce the impact of this giant iceberg on climate change , a great many of the eclipse of the Antarctic Peninsula has fallen in recent decades .	-5.6753
This long apple of Antarctica stretches towards South America .	-3.5805
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey , the Arctic Ocean has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.7741
The temperature increase has contributed to the decline .	-2.4699
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees over the past 50 years , and thus is one of the fastest growing areas of temperature .	-5.5761
The CDU ’ s Struggle to the Personal	-3.5792
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to fill vacant positions , the CDU is calling for the association of employers to be more attractive .	-4.7114
Just before the summer recess , the circular day wrapped 41 new administrative posts .	-5.4522
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the Mettmann district administration .	-2.3439
Now , 17 apprentices have left behind their first working day .	-3.3061
It seems that the schools in the circle are highly sought .	-5.5146
Around 620 applications were recorded for the seats in vain this year .	-4.2915
However , the circle still lacks personnel to meet the increased demands and challenges .	-4.7160
There are still 50 vacant positions in the Mettmann circle at the moment . , , and . , , , , , , , ,	-5.4983
We are looking for doctors and engineers as well as general administration forces .	-4.5146
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UWG , would like to take the initiative to counter the administrative shortage of skilled workers .	-5.6285
According to the wishes of the parties , the administration should ' create a concept for personnel recruitment and development ' .	-6.0460
The aim is not only to meet short-term needs of professionals , but to counter the shortage of candidates in the future , it is said .	-6.4088
The overall concept should be oriented both internally and externally , show concrete measures for the young student and include a training offensive , call for the CDU , the FDP and the UWG .	-7.4970
That sounds like a good approach .	-2.4938
The circle has staffing problems that you never knew before .	-5.2751
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-3.4060
There is talk of a genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.0755
In addition , a large number of employees who are out of service due to illness or age .	-4.2793
So it is high time to act so that more jobs are not left vacant .	-5.2538
But Klaus-Dieter peoples , the leader of the CDU , and his party , go beyond the joint request .	-5.3011
It recently produced a faint surprise in the district day when it publicly questioned the ceiling on personnel and stunned the other parties .	-7.6009
People want to see any possibility of leaving the local employers ’ association reviewed .	-4.7680
" If we do not find a satisfactory solution here in the short term , the county administration with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the local cities - should aim for a house tariff , " says peoples .	-7.3078
By doing so , the CDU is trying to pay better for employees and officials than the public service tariff system actually provides .	-5.9039
At the moment , salaries are strictly required , increases or more money are available only if you change to a higher level that is geared to professional years .	-6.7970
But the challenges of the circle have increased in recent years .	-2.3761
Only a few weeks ago , new rooms had to be set up in which employees take care of the provisions of the new law on prostitution .	-4.3846
Last but not least , the increasing number of asylum seekers has a problem for LandCouncil Thomas Hendele and director Martin Richter : they have insufficient staff .	-5.2695
Italy ’ s Tightening the Ton of NGO migrant rescue boats	-3.1194
Italy has warned NGOs that use rescue boats for Mediterranean migrants that they cannot continue unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-3.8910
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Minister of the Interior Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin daily newspaper La Stampa .	-3.3495
Minnitis ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Youth Rettet ' , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-5.1631
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed allegations of the Italian prosecutor Ambogio Cartoosio .	-4.8521
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that at the moment we cannot operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-4.8482
'We can only judge all the accusations that are being made at the moment after we have gathered all the information and can assess the situation ' .	-5.0930
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the ' Youth Retreat ' boat , which Iuventa has been sailing since October .	-3.8254
It is suspected that his crew will take tubular migrants on board that will be delivered directly to them by human traffickers , and that the smugglers will be able to drive off so that the ships can be used again .	-7.6068
At least one such meeting was supposed to take place only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosecutor 's case , whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.7420
The crew is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian coast guard , monitoring the rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-4.3180
Under the code of conduct , boats such as Iuventa must , above all , have an Italian police officer on board who monitors their activities .	-4.2644
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to keep their code : Save the Children , MODAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-3.5520
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary but acceptable , because they would not bring with them ' substantial changes or obstacles ' of their bailouts .	-4.6033
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel Prize laureate organisation is doctors without frontiers ( MSF ) .	-3.5315
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue operations in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.3364
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the Minister said .	-2.4334
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.2418
Sticks and Trials	-3.1732
Neu Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the north of Wegz to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-6.4215
Three friendly guides were available for this purpose .	-1.9463
Accommodation in the Wachenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-3.1492
The castle and wine festival of Wachheim was a welcome extra .	-2.2386
On hot summer temperatures along the vineyards , the first tour led to Michaelskapelle above Deidesheim .	-4.2450
It was followed by vantage points , some on towers , which could be seen far above the Pfälzer Forest and the outlay plains .	-7.6699
In between , there were frequent extended increases for which long Trials were inhabited .	-6.5179
On the second day , Bad Dürkheim went to Saline and the popular sausages market .	-3.9186
Another viewpoint , connected by " flowige " trials and moderate climbs . , of are and . are , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.0522
On the last two days there was a lot of meters of altitude again .	-4.5027
Caves , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .	-3.2670
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers inhale the brine in an open-air inhalation .	-4.0636
Neustadt has also been under control .	-2.6548
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had reached the Pfälzer Forest from its best side - both in sport and in culture .	-4.8267
console rather than lawn - Bundesliga 's equipment for E-Sport	-4.8382
Are the sports stars sitting in front of computer consoles in the future instead of being swept through in wind and weather over the stadium turf ?	-5.5819
Fact is : E-Sport has long since become a serious industry , becoming a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gages included .	-5.7374
This has also been recognized by the first federal lawmakers , who are increasingly involved in this area .	-5.6682
The VfL Wolfsburg began in 2015 , followed by the FC Schalke 04 and , last but not least , the VfB Stuttgart , which founded an e-sports department in mid-July and won two FIFA 17 professionals under contract .	-7.6570
" We hope to attract new young target groups to the VfB " , says Management Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-4.9014
He is sure " that there are several clubs on this train " .	-4.7589
Next weekend , FIFA will host the first " Interactive Club World Cup " in London , where gamers from different clubs compete against each other .	-4.6333
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-3.7757
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-2.0353
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.4646
" Real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 people in particular , that young people will still go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-5.4959
And : the clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.3598
With prominent E-Sporters under contract , you could have a much more online presence in these markets than just send the Bundesliganschauft to Asia once a year .	-6.1108
What exactly is this all about ?	-2.0927
In E-Sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or even football simulation FIFA are challenged at competition level .	-4.1963
As in normal sports , leagues have long established themselves in which professionals compete against each other .	-4.5937
And for the 2022 Asian games , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-2.6451
But is it a real sport ?	-2.3079
For many , the idea needs to be used safely .	-4.4022
Ingo Froangry too has long grappled with the question .	-3.5196
E-Sport is a sport for the professor at the German Academy of Sports in Cologne , because he is competent and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequency , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-6.4726
It also requires cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding , and a fast response capability .	-3.9080
Professional gamers should not only train at the console , but also train their bodies and take care of their diet . , , and , and are .	-6.6564
" The fit player is a good player . "	-2.0488
However , frog also sees problems : ' doping is becoming more and more an issue ' .	-4.8309
Controls are difficult to implement in online games , and the scene lacked the structures of classical sport .	-4.5431
The scientists are positive about the high integrative impact of e-sport .	-3.9110
Players are on the international road , like a large global family , and there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.2120
A study conducted by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth for E-Sport .	-4.0496
In 2016 , EUR 50 million had been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and big tournaments .	-3.6178
In three years , sales are expected to reach 130 million .	-3.3128
This is a little counter to the almost EUR 2.4 billion of the German Football League .	-6.7412
However , e-sports " is no longer far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or hockey , " the Deloitte consultants write .	-4.7765
Internationally , many countries are already on the way . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.5834
Major markets are Asia and the US , where former basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US team NGO eSports .	-3.6911
Hollywood player Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSports betting company Unikrn .	-3.6040
There is also something in Europe .	-3.1543
In a Norwegian school , e-sport has been introduced as a teaching subject , says Froevil .	-5.1352
In the Netherlands and in France , according to Dutt , the football football network is now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-5.9667
" Germany is lagging behind in the European comparison " , says VfB Executive Board Rottgermann .	-4.7214
It is only in nostalgia to fall , and to transform the old times is no longer enough .	-6.4560
It is a matter of preserving the tradition of the association , but also of adapting the company to the modern market .	-3.6980
" We live in a digitized world , " said Dutt .	-2.7860
" It is not enough to point out that only football remains as it always was " .	-6.6109

Michelle Carter condemned for the texts that push Conrad Roy to suicide .	-2.7024
A Massachusetts woman was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend through texts and calls to suicide .	-2.7889
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars , and five years have been suspended .	-1.6794
Carter was convicted in June of negligent killings by Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-3.0214
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is undefined .	-2.2579
My son was my best friend . '	-0.8410
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .	-1.5796
She was faced with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both she and Mr Roy suffered mental illness .	-3.5033
dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse , Carter stood in his eyes with tears , with folded hands and downwards eyes when she was convicted .	-4.5602
" Their actions have killed Conrad Roy , " said the lawyer to the court .	-3.4864
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.5998
She did not take responsibility ' , she said .	-2.4883
" She has not shown remorse " .	-2.6765
But Carter ’ s lawyers said that it is a ' terrible thing that they deeply regret ' .	-5.4048
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not discover that their " age or maturity , or even their mental illness , have a significant influence on their actions " .	-4.1404
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother , Lynn Roy , who said that " there is no day on which I did not suffer the loss of my beloved son .	-4.1544
I want him to be proud of me and as I have done with everything , and I try to be there for his sisters in spite of all the pain we will carry with us for eternity , " he says .	-7.4147
Roys sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she was " persecuted " by the realization that she would never attend the wedding of her brother or be a aunt for his children .	-5.1592
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-5.3505
The case seems to set a legal precedent , since there is no law in Massachusetts which makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-3.1347
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in a vehicle in 2014 by a carbon monoxidvergification .	-2.2561
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s textions revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life .	-4.4148
" Come on , head of a building , start yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several messages she had sent in the two weeks before his death , while he was on holiday with his family .	-5.0415

Joshua Kimmich was born at the Audi Cup as a captain .	-5.0019
The FC Bayern is hoping for a great season for the conted-Cup winner - extra motivation is not harmed .	-7.0018
Somewhat was different in his seat in the cabin , which saw Joshua Kimmic immediately , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .	-4.9654
But since the Audi Cup was far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , not a Philipp Lahm , nor a Manuel Neu , he made the tie to the arm .	-7.9208
" The coach did not announce it , " said the Coned-Cup winner afterwards , after his first bet as a Bavarian bardier .	-6.1654
Well , the shelter could have gone better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.3568
But the coach ’ s sign could be interpreted in this way , too .	-4.6637
Not the eight years old Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a playwright for young people , debuts and professionals who had just been out of the holiday , but he was chosen as a playmaker .	-11.0419
Sugar is best distributed to those who are most anxious to keep up with their whims .	-5.8620
So anyone who has been chosen to take the heritage of Lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-5.7730
Kimberly confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-4.7612
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old had a mini Lahm flying over the field .	-3.4676
Right behind , this is now his position , the white binding at the arm did the rest .	-3.0430
In any case , kimmh was working in this initial formation like the one that best puts the ruder in his hand .	-9.5534

Businesses satisfied with rhend-Glossary Minister : Economics praised Wissings Tempo	-7.2593
It has often become unconciliatory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still Minister for Economic Affairs of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-4.6098
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs Volker Wissing ( FDP ) is in office .	-3.5495
Chambers and businesses from the region speak , on T V , of a shift in economic policy and simultaneously of the old minister .	-5.4993
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wissing meets the wishes of the economy , which all blocked Lemke " .	-4.0023
The biggest U-turn is Natus ’ s infrastructure policy : the link between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priorities .	-5.2069

Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but international companies .	-4.1625
The Chamber of Commerce ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wissing , is seeking a Rhineland-Palatinate label at the wine to increase the sales volume in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports that have been shaking off for ten years .	-7.1333
Moreover , Wissing have an open ear for people who want to create their own company , praises the IHK .	-3.6298

Audi is expected to change 85,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers are facing a backlash .	-3.7817
One day before Audi announced , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.4723
The BMW Chairman said that the company believes that ' there are smarter options than road restrictions ' , referring to European cities , including Munich , where BMW is based , banning or restricting diesel . , , , and , , , are , and , , , , , , , , , , , , and , , ,	-9.3209
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to reduce its diesel emissions .	-2.3452
None of the companies described the undertakings as a callback .	-2.4355
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel cars in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-5.8343
But the nitrogen oxides emitted by diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.2505
The cost to car manufacturers to install equipment for neutralising exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep cars competitive .	-4.3017
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of obstructing the powerful car companies and of ignoring the signs of the problem .	-3.8168
Companies are trying to avoid Volkswagen ’ s mistakes , which were able to regulate the use of so-called end-of-life devices that could regulate emissions in order to comply with the regulations when a car was tested , but which go back in normal driving conditions .	-7.4886
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , while others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.8059
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.4964
The former manager , Zacceo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-3.0653
At the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the Audi authorities accused of having installed a system to circumvent the emissions requirements in Europe and a question focused on the United States was extended .	-4.6830
The inclusion of Audi in the study could put a heavy burden on Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer bears a disproportionate share of the Volkswagen profits .	-4.8128

Mordillos Knollinae and the Laughter of suffering	-3.5305
Mordillo was , at times , one of the most widely published cartoons , the nodules of his figures are his trademark .	-5.5946
Also with 85 the Argentines still draw and works on a film .	-2.8882
His message : laugh , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-2.2171
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.8721
In the first years as an artist , he beat himself , among other things , as a draughtsman for greeting cards - which frustrated him .	-5.9696
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-1.8395
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in the end of the 1960s with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then also in the " Star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.1873
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.4979
Again and again , artists drew inspiration from cities .	-3.5198
Large , rounded Mordillo figures can be found in drawings with the sliding tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.5954
In the early morning he says he is still sitting at the drawing table , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.8525
With calendars , puzzles , books for adults and children , t-shirts , pimps and watches , his drolly figures continue to spread much around the world .	-7.3891
For six years , he has also worked on a cartoons and a TV series with his figures .	-4.6267
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a Giraffe - Mordillos favourite animal in his drawings - who has one thousand feet as a opposing player .	-5.3862
For the first time his figures speak in the 3D film , which is to be released in 2019 .	-5.3500
" I do not know exactly what they are going to say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-5.5827
The script is not written by him .	-1.7556
That 's why he relies on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced without word .	-5.6999
The Lavender from Provence under threat of climate change	-4.9569
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-2.5519
Lavender is declining due to droughts and disease-causing insects , causing major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.2033
Eric Chaisse , expert in the Agricultural Research Institute CRIEPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which caused much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .	-6.2630
This affects the life of lavender .	-2.3945
There is also a small cikade , a microbacterium that transfers dwarves , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-4.4254
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.6340
Lavender oil does not only attract tourists , but also for perfume and cosmetics .	-4.8116
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant plants with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , developed and either missing or weakened .	-3.8194
So we have less components with essential oil . '	-2.6745
The solutions that are considered include better distribution of water and a slowing down of soil evaporation , but also spray plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drying .	-5.5661

Killing a journalist underlines the growing threat in Mexico	-1.2449
The staff of the weekly Riodoce meet normally on Wednesdays to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the state of Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials and incessant drug wars .	-4.8886
But on that day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-2.5472
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.8432
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer : they are going to take their children to the office , which was the aim of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-5.2977
Security experts have written three words on a panel on the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-1.9499
They ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and belly feelings are sufficient . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.5760
There are drug traffickers , politicians , business people , journalists suspected of being on the salary list of the government or the cartels , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-4.4279
There is no respite from violence , and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths this year in seven states .	-5.9249
The latter is her editor and her inspiration for Riodoce , the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.1280
" The greatest mistake is to live and be a journalist in Mexico , " Valez wrote in one of his many books about drugs violence .	-3.7089
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez , showing his middle finger with the word " Justice " depends on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-6.5013
The workshop will take place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their shared themes , the trauma , their nightmares , insomnia , paranoia .	-2.4805
Although a special Federal Bar Bar was set up in 2010 to deal with journalists ' cases , according to the Committee on the Protection of Journalists , it only initiated two criminal proceedings .	-5.8255
As with most thousands of murders involving drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely brought to justice .	-3.2319
In Riodoce , they are still insisting on treating the violence of Sinaloa , even though they are undefeatable and even though the terrain is now still a treacherous one .	-6.4999
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting for discussion of security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-3.2126
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.6457
" Until we know why , we all mistrust . "	-3.4944
On the morning of May 15 Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the capital of Culican .	-3.9545
He managed to drive a few blocks far before his Red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car , , , , , and . , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.9060
The patron drove away in his car and damaged it near .	-3.9969
Valdez was 50 years old .	-1.1726
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.0808
Rumours tend to fly around freely in Culican .	-5.1639
But on Valdez there is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.8170
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival factions are fighting to fill the vacuum .	-3.2379
There is nothing that in Sinaloa every day someone or several people are shot on the street , or that the cemetery is full of twisted , two-story mausoleums for drug kings , which are larger than many homes for the living .	-6.6428
For one minute , forget that there is a state of peace if only a cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-4.6130
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , has broken the blame for not protecting his friend .	-4.1005
He believes that two misunderstandings contributed to the murder .	-1.7918
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival coalition factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.6239
This publication may have angered the sons , suspected gang members bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-4.8560
The second mistake was not to force Valez to leave the country for its own security after the capture of another newspaper that published the same story .	-4.8211
Valez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.2039
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues accepted that he would always be there .	-2.3958
He was an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold $ 50 in investments .	-3.8525
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to perform journalism without encountering the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.9157
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for bold and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-3.2173
Reporters loved publishing hard studies without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else dared to treat .	-3.5206
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , it received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Award " for reporting in Latin America .	-3.3071
In the same year , Valez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led .	-3.7745
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.5825
" I want to live on , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.6632
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompido TV .	-3.5836
" You have to take on the task that you as a journalist - either that or you play the stupid .	-5.1072
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many dead ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-4.1916
The Riodoce team missed Valdez , the Spacebird who could curse a dock worker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-6.5229
They relied on their routine .	-3.0020
He would always be wearing his hat .	-1.8809
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office and always sit at the same table .	-2.6231
Now they ask : Was his love of routine his demise ?	-2.6588
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how they can best do their work and keep alive .	-3.7467
" You don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their hidden runways and runways " to move drugs .	-5.7291
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.4857
The result , even in the best times , is a high level of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.2113
Trust his own instincts .	-1.5475
If it smells wrong , it will stop .	-4.8770
The anger is , said the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal , that ' smell is a sense that can be misled ... and then things have happened with Javier . '	-4.3392
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as they do not apply in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states where a toxic mixture of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials are at home .	-4.4978
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.5262
In the space where Riodoce ’ s employees met for security training , mobile phones were suddenly not allowed ; days earlier , it became known that spyware , which is sold exclusively to governments , was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.6405
Outside sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-2.3777
They were appointed by the local government to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-storey building in a mid-class area of Culican .	-5.5391
Half in the joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police officers who the governor himself described as untrusted .	-5.1628
It is months since the reporters have gone into the mountains , where drug gangs are effectively under control .	-5.1503
For this week 's edition , Riodoce has written on three main stories .	-2.5871
There was the assassination of the brother of the former famous Boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.7956
They also had an Exposé on government spending , which focused on the hometown of the governor .	-3.0473
And there was a group carrying out an abduction in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culican , one block from the office of the Public Prosecutor .	-3.6574
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or how it happened , so it was necessary to take care when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.1597
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the ruling Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost the entire century all political levels .	-4.1966
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-profile cases .	-1.4595
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.8858
Only a few months earlier , the reader would have regarded Valez ’ s column as the most informed source of the abduction .	-4.1819
" Previously we knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body statur .	-3.9597
" Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . "	-2.4120
The Valdez office has been turned into a storage space for characters and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because the staff have become something they never expected themselves : activists on behalf of the press .	-5.7138
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration next morning for another journalist to the office of the prosecutor .	-3.7360
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.5016
A burnt body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests , that it is his .	-2.1424
Throughout the country , journalists have become louder by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on walkways and buildings .	-3.9927
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and tries to gather international support for the judiciary in the Valdez case .	-5.5075
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they told the truth .	-4.2752
Since then , she has asked for it to be re-allocated by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-4.9150
Valdez had repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico are " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved and an equal society .	-4.0234
In his last book , Narco-Journalism , he wrote that reporters are killed not only by drug gangs , but also by politicians and security forces that were covered by organized crime .	-4.4895
The Articulo 19 media group allocated more than half of the attacks on police and civil servants last year .	-3.1303
" In Mexico , you stir because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-4.2538
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-1.9136
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.8982
Her body was found together with a note supposedly signed by the Zetass cartel : ' Here I am because of my reports ' .	-3.9141
A computer keyboard and headphones were on their off head .	-3.7306
Some branches have chosen to close as the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the assassination of the correspondents Miroslava Breach in March .	-4.0442
Others continue , as happened to El Manana by Nuevo Laredo after the murder of her director in 2004 .	-3.7952
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartels with an editorial on the front page with the title " What do you want from us ? " .	-3.8378
Some journalists have fled from their home countries , or even from the country .	-2.3316
It is a painful decision .	-0.6238
It is difficult to find work in exile and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.8957
And sometimes they are being driven , as it seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City .	-4.5433
For those who stay behind and continue working it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-5.0094
Ibara , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking scares him .	-2.7043
" Mexico goes to hell , and therefore I was reporter , " he said .	-2.8983
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition had already ended , Riodoce ’ s editors were on the sidewalk in front of the office and beer , when all their phones started to be too big .	-7.0729
A number of shootings with gang rival and security forces near the Mazatlan bathing resort had left 19 lives behind .	-4.8767
The war continued to escalate , as was promised by a number of cartel unions in the region .	-3.3851
From the top of the board you have published the latest on the Riodoce website via mobile .	-6.5884
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.1878
Sirene was nearby - another shooting in the area .	-2.9680
Bojorquez cast a look at the police officers who kept guards to see if they were willing .	-3.9642

At first sight it looks like a statue , albeit a terrifying .	-2.8785
Researchers have now found that the first insights of the incredible Nashorn of a Canadian mountain worker have been received so well that experts have described it as the " Mona Lisa of the dinosaur " .	-6.6180
It was so well received that they even discovered that his scaly skin was brown - and they said she had had had something of a " restless past " .	-6.8894
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it " the best preserved dinosaur that has ever been found , and one of the best dinosaur displays in the world " .	-6.7784
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nooxyfuel that lived in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-3.7639
His incredibly well preserved state has puzzled researchers who describe it as ' truly remarkable ' .	-3.6925
According to reports in National Geographic , the dissected herbivores is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.1062
It was found by Shawn Funk on 21 March 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-2.7689
He hit something that seemed inappropriate from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-4.2750
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology .	-1.9440
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the GBP 2.100 kg ( 1.100 kg ) of severe earth tests .	-5.2763
After all this hard work , the final result is now ready to be revealed .	-2.5159
" If you smile a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrell Museum , where the creature is visible .	-4.4223
" It will go down in the science history as one of the most beautiful and best preserved dinosaurs - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosauriere . "	-3.7576
Researchers have found that , although this herbivorous is covered with an armature and resembles a changing tank , it is likely that meat sweetened dinosaurs have been threatened .	-7.2466
The heavily packed dinosaurs used a red and white camouflage to hide themselves from predators , and used a shielding technique known as counter-attestation used by many modern animals .	-5.1554
This would have allowed a better mix into his surroundings and to soften his enemies , experts say , which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-7.1288
110 million years old creature from the Nodosaurier family made headlines in May for the first time and is now on display in the Royal Tyrell Museum of Paleontology .	-4.5096
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markcheli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours with it to reveal it carefully .	-5.7528
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor on his body .	-3.6528
They discovered contour burial , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of the creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.7598
Although contour burial is common , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of the animals living today .	-6.3628
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure by flesh ferocious dinosaurs that Evolution favored suppressing confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.3382
But most of the contemporary animals that use the outline attestation - think of deer , zebra or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , signaling that this noacidic has been exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-8.8349
" Strong predators on a massive , highly packed dinosaur show how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been , " said Brown .	-4.4579
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-1.5898
Scientists continue to study the animal on references to his life , including its conserved intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .	-4.9122
They believe that , when he died , the dinosaur went into a river and was driven out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the seabed .	-6.0537
At that time , Alberta was as warm as southern florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much farther inland than they are today .	-3.8555
" This noacidic is truly remarkable because it is completely covered with frozen skin , but it remains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " said Brown .	-6.0842
" The result is that the animal looks almost like in the early Cretaceous period .	-3.6379
You don 't need much imagination to use to reconstruct it .	-3.3774
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge Therehoods , carnivorous dinosaurs , standing on two legs , crossed the earth .	-5.6879
Although the king of them , the Tyrannoseus Rex , lived for millions of years after Borealopelta , the dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-5.5607
The Acrocanthacid , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-4.0534
Scientists , whose latest findings appear in the scientific journal Current Biology , believe that Borealopelta was sunk in the sea after death and in mud .	-5.9905
The creature was found by Shawn Funk on March 21 , 2011 at the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada , grub .	-3.1083
According to the museum , it is the best preserved dinosaur of the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the snout to the hips .	-4.6998
Creatures were on average about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and have weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.0735
It contained two 20-inch long tips that hit his shoulders .	-3.1935
The researchers believe that the dissected planter was swollen by Western Canada until a flood river flooded it into the open sea .	-5.0634
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur preserve its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.5216
The fossilised remains of this special example are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy panels along the dinosaur belt .	-5.3482
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a lottery profit .	-3.3330
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.4021
Hidden remnants of the skin still cover the bumpy armoured plates that bear the skull of the animal .	-5.0565

In a thunderstorm : Mass karambolage to A8 : Many injured .	-3.9992
Huge accident on Thursday evening on the A8 : Nearly 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambole .	-6.2245
There are many injuries , many kilometres of traffic jams - and accidents .	-4.2514
On the Stuttgart-Munich motorway ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on the late Thursday afternoon at a mass karambolage .	-3.8997
According to the first police , at 5 p.m. , between Adelzhausen and Oedelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) , almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks , were fitted in another way .	-9.0895
There were no indications at first of all about the exact number of injured persons .	-4.1927
It handles for minor to medium-heavy injuries , said a police spokesman .	-4.3782
A major offer of rescue vehicles was at the point of the accident .	-4.1219
The A8 was completely closed towards Munich .	-2.2209
In the direction of Munich there was a backlog of about ten kilometres .	-5.3765
As a AZ-reporter reports , there was also massive disability on the opposite track - due to a large number of cases .	-5.7503
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle guide , who are now subject to sensitive penalties .	-5.7056
Shortly after 18 : 45 a second accident took place on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dassing .	-3.7438
It was a collision between a passenger and a passenger car .	-4.4891
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident centre .	-2.2945
Deutsche Bahn : Group is testing " Sleep in comfort " .	-5.4685
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : you are sitting in the train and sleeping .	-6.5241
Or you are deepening in your work and have just a brilliant idea .	-3.5126
And then : puff .	-0.9400
If you come to the designer , you will be able to get an unexcited or take a closer look at the passengers in the middle of the workflow .	-11.2451
Control of tickets .	-2.2233
But the periods of interruptions are soon over .	-2.6725
The German Railway is currently testing the most comprehensive ticket control system .	-4.7128
It 's easy to get a ticket by phone .	-8.4705
Currently , a test operation runs on two tracks .	-3.4781
" If the offer arrives , we will extend it .	-3.7727
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance transport routes in Germany " , said a rail preacher .	-5.9761
" Comfort check-in " calls the train the card validation without the conductor .	-6.9604
In order to be able to use them , however , a few requirements have to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-4.7416
And you have to book an online ticket - as most passengers already do .	-3.9536
It is also necessary to buy the DB Navigator via the Rail App , which is the most convenient way to book tickets .	-6.1566
Last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-3.0882
This is because the " comfort check in " works like this : you go up the train and get your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-8.0375
A button for electronic devaluation will appear at test customers .	-4.2588
The train attendants will be informed on their mobile devices that the passenger X is in the train and has occupied the booked seat Y .	-5.0844
If train tickets are checked in place Y , they know that there is a passenger with an online ticket that has already been paid .	-6.7885
So you can sleep on and continue to work , not to mention .	-4.1759
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train , which is intended to use to passengers .	-5.1944
" If you want to relax without ticket control by our train crew , you can check in the DB Navigator yourself .	-5.7236
This allows passengers to personalize their travel time by train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Board of DB Fernfahrt .	-3.9292
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than they are today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-5.0289
Those who travel on the train often know that , apart from delays and passengers , ticket controls are among the most annoying .	-6.8693
Because you often do not have all the documents you need to purchase online tickets .	-6.2852
There is no credit card or identity card or any other document you need to show . are , , , etc . , , or .	-12.7523
The result is endless discussions between train crews and passengers , which leads to bad mood in the department or in the large room and delays in the control of their own tickets and ultimately takes the time for the patron to deal with other concerns .	-8.7834
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.7800
And that also only on the ICE 915 Dortmund-tuttgart connections and ICE 912 Stuttgart food .	-4.6069
Other train numbers on the same line are not yet available .	-3.3904
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Why Streets ? '	-3.5355
On 9 August 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.9987
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the people in St. Louis Geboren sat on the bed of an Airbnb apartment that they rented and scraped through Facebook on their phone .	-5.2040
She stumbled over a post from someone from high school .	-1.9535
" The police just killed an 18-year-old child and it is still on the street " , it was said there .	-3.6615
Confused , as nobody else on their feed had ticked the information , it closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-4.4361
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweeded on their timeline .	-3.9205
The rapper from the area of St. Louis was killing the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old , killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-4.0512
He posted an image of Browns ’ lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would remain there for four hours .	-4.6499
" That 's wild " , Ferrell thought along .	-5.2186
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.9104
She left her mobile phone to return to Tweets on Canfield Drive later in the evening .	-4.9565
There were photos of the police band and people who screamed , and of a man who claimed to be Browns father who bore a sign with the inscription : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-4.0950
She observed a live feed where a policeman faced with a group of demonstrators with a bellow dog .	-4.3994
In another video , she said , another policeman revealed his rifle and shouted : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-3.4329
" This is not common " , Ferrell remembered her statement .	-3.1067
'That is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can call typical ' .	-4.4855
At this moment I felt Schüttelfrost .	-3.8024
I was angry and crying ' .	-2.9547
You booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-3.4997
After landing at 23 o 'clock , they removed their 6-year daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two next morning would go to Ferguson .	-5.0622
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary film , " Who Streets ? " , in cinemas from the 11th .	-4.4932
It is a history of survival and protest , of love and loss , of strength and resilience that exists from the point of view of the people living in the community and filling the streets to demand answers .	-4.0572
When Ferrell drove with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a matching crown , after Ferguson , the two had a conversation that they had repeatedly this morning » about the black experience and the black state <unk> .	-7.2403
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe ? " She remembered what she said .	-3.4078
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.7109
I could not take her with her , " said Ferrell later .	-2.5125
" What happened today is a climax of what happened in the past .	-2.6354
It must know it and see it and be raised in it .	-3.1429
It must be well developed , not only by activism and organisation , but also by the different layers of the black experience and the black constitution , and what we need to do to be free to rid ourselves .	-7.1826
Although I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black woman 's .	-4.4732
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it . '	-4.4519
The first station they arrived in Ferguson was in South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a camp where activists were waiting for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson .	-6.8487
It was there that Ferrell and her daughter joined a local business owner who made for lunch .	-4.0981
They prepared bags and helped pass them on to protesters .	-3.3148
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-2.0178
" My activism has changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St . Louis President of Minority Student Nurses Association focused on eating justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.3574
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.9311
It all happened . '	-3.4567
Weeks later , Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-1.7405
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alfado Farrar wanted to " document " what happened .	-3.4979
One question asked Ferrell : " Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? "	-4.2850
This scepticism has been fed by countless cases of people , often of White , in a community that has benefited from its pain and resilience .	-4.0262
As Folayan recently said in an interview , ' We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centralise their voices and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.5203
Folayan had already cooperated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the area known for his activism in the area of death rights . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6763
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , along with six other locals , followed the team of " Why Streets ? " in the years after browsing .	-5.1777
" This documentary is not a person who speaks for us or talks with us .	-3.3042
" That was the main thing for me as these people are represented , because that is how I will be represented . "	-5.3498
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a Messias leader but a community that comes together " , said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participants in the film .	-5.0144
As a result , “ Who Streets ? ” documents show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell ’ s life , as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-4.4053
" I felt as naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.4157
" But I understand that there needs to be some vulnerability in this work and in the dehumanisation of black people . "	-3.4650
In addition , Ferrell ’ s story repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black-Lives-Matter-Movement .	-3.8826
Two of the three founders of the movement who , after the killing of the black teenager Tracy Martin in 2012 , characterized the movie " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-4.9804
" Black , gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-4.5453
Black , gay women must bear the brunt of everything . '	-2.2883
Folayan voted to note that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.7354
However , it insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " when Ferrell was chosen as the heart of the film because of its identity .	-4.4639
" She was the person who upped this energy , " she said .	-3.5824
" It is not by chance , although she was on the front line , because in a life on these crossings there is so much at stake as a black , gay woman .	-5.0036
You can feel your energy through the screen ' .	-2.0474
Meanwhile , the news cameras have long since disappeared in Ferguson , but the racial connections between the community and the police continue to exist .	-3.7157
Ferrell is on probation for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-2.0259
It describes the region 's social atmosphere , which it calls its home : " A Chaos " .	-3.9376
However , she does not follow a song and she feels committed to this memory since she went to the street three years ago .	-6.7933
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.7928
It is our duty to win .	-1.0411
We must love and support each other .	-1.3900
We have nothing to lose - except our chains . '	-1.5892
From " Dream " to " Megamania " : TV readers discuss Bit-Gallery .	-3.6808
The bit-gallery moves people even though it is not yet built .	-3.5685
But the idea of a shopping centre on the southern end of the pedestrian zone has split the population of supporters and opponents since the first presentation 2009 .	-4.1186
Cold hardly makes the topic one .	-2.8579
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreund Bitburg " .	-2.2382
While some say on the Bit-Gallery : " This would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " It would be real class " ( Nicole Schausten ) , the other side goes : " Do not need a person " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " Weidenmach ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-7.5763
While supporters are building a gallery to attract more customers to the city , which also benefits the rest of the city , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will be bleeding .	-6.4777
In addition , the gallery is planned on the grounds where the farmers ' market hall is located , where 13 direct market participants offer their products .	-6.4611
This will come to an end when construction works begin .	-3.8521
The Galerie-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Besa-Platz with possibility of sitting outside .	-5.3670
Simone Zimmer : " For many years we have been purchasing almost weekly at the farm market hall .	-5.3366
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the rural women are always very happy .	-3.8429
We also discovered the butchery for us .	-2.4593
We would like to see a chance to maintain this offer even during and especially after the construction of the gallery .	-4.4520
In other cities , that is what is happening .	-4.0991
Especially the small market hall in Frankfurt is interesting . '	-2.7841
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery comes to the amount of the rent .	-5.2284
However , it is likely that they will not be very low in the new project ' .	-5.6192
Eva Kilic : " Why shopping malls in Bitburg ?	-1.9427
Whether it is clothes , shoes , drugstores or supermarkets : I find this unnecessary .	-4.9300
There is enough of that in our city .	-2.0200
You can see how many shops are empty here - some have been for months and years .	-4.0784
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least have the market hall .	-4.8179
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , mostly offered directly by the producer and are inexpensive .	-5.1187
As you can see , shop stores in a shopping center are only rented by larger companies , because the local rents are often not sustainable for retailers .	-6.2249
Unfortunately , special deals are almost non-existent , and what remains of them will probably disappear . '	-5.3782
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit for me .	-2.5300
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.5203
Above all , where is the farm market building supposed to take place ?	-5.2311
The old Edeka would be the solution - even longer if the bit gallery actually comes at some point .	-3.9331
Or does the Ghost Bit-Gallery already manage to distribute all shops from Bitburg ? "	-5.0263
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-2.6919
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.5866
I think it would have been better to promote a real farming market rather than this gallery .	-3.0212
But for a farm market hall there is no room for any more , thanks to the crazy many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-6.2500
When the farm market hall is broken , a little bit of culture will disappear . '	-4.2171
A matching similarity : artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA .	-2.7344
In the middle of the room of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to be seen - white , black and brown , which are almost indistinguishable - that hang on the cable .	-5.3660
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heath Dewey-Hagborg from Wangen-Tupotten and haircuts sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-4.6173
Manning sent the excerpts from the prison Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst spent a 35-year sentence , having published a classified diplomatic announcement on the WikiLeaks website .	-6.1564
The new exhibition , which was opened on August 2 , is called A forthcoming Resemblane ( A matching similarity ) .	-4.6519
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline combines its expertise in technology , computer science and art , and mastering , a transcultural and pioneering dissident whose conviction was changed by Barack Obama only three days later .	-7.7503
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted by Manning and created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look with these genomic data , has created a sharp , though somewhat intellectual commentary not only on the malleability of DNA data - the many ways in which they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also on identity .	-6.4475
Manning , who was born as Bradley Edward , but who has spoken openly about the identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 charges , including six offences against the spy law , computer fraud and theft .	-6.2348
Their image was suppressed by the prison , so much that there was only one photograph - a grainy black and black Selfie , in which Manning is obviously uncomfortable on a driver seat and carries a plate wig - with which she was associated .	-8.2294
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-3.4213
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artefacts such as cigarette stub and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of how these people could look .	-5.4890
This was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.5995
" She conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " explained Dewey-Hagborg at a press presentation of the new exhibition .	-4.3303
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so she took contact with Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.6943
The artist and her incarcerated muse became unequal friend of letters who exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-4.4486
They even created a Comic Suppressed Images , illustrated by Shoili Kanngo , which foresaw a future in which President ChelSeas ’ s judgment would be converted , and would be able to view the exhibition personally .	-6.6571
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.3370
There is also a little low and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is leading a war against whistle-blowers from the government camp and transgenders to find new ways to further flash the rigid divisions that he should actually correct .	-6.8309
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.7378
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called with her grand signature ( the " i " in her family name is attached with a heart ) an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which have been sex , race , sexuality and culture . "	-6.0594
On the opposite wall their co-ochondrial DNA sequence is written in pencil - a thousand feet of both Cs and Gs and As .	-6.3109
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show how surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all , by incorporating the 200 letters ( nucleotides according to the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) .	-6.1579
" What people hopefully will take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , track memories , is also to be seen .	-5.0372
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so they are 30 of these stories . "	-2.2722
The last piece in the exhibition , which is stored in its own room , is a page from the above mentioned comic book .	-4.3409
It shows Manning how it appears in hand from the disciplinary courts of the United States such as King-Kong with a telephone call .	-5.1083
" When you scale up your speech , they have won , " it says .	-4.8169
" So never stop the mouth " .	-2.7562
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist from Philadelphia .	-2.7239
" I still get gooselooked when I talk about it . "	-3.7394
Manning has not seen the exhibition personally yet - as anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed in the middle of the room by the masks , by their own genomic formations , which merge like hordes of protesters .	-6.7561
This was also focused on how everything in the exhibition , up to size ( 5 " 2 , Mannings stature ) , in which their genetic hatgroups were written with pencil .	-6.2417

Professor of Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University is sought for killing .	-4.5055
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and a University of Oxford staff to be found to be suspects after a man had been killed in a luxurious apartment in Chicago .	-5.7796
On Monday , for Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) arrest warrants were issued for murder because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trent H. James Cornell Duraneau , as shown by the files of Cook County ’ s court .	-4.7596
The documents say that Cornell Duraneau , 26 , died after several slips .	-3.2156
A Community warning system issued by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-3.3383
Staff received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.5981
Cornell Duraneleau was still declared dead in the place of events , and detectives investigate the spot as murder , while the police actively seek the two suspects , officials said .	-4.7564
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 .	-2.3677
Alan K. Cubbbage , the Vice-President for university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem has now been certified and excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-4.6695
" This is now a criminal matter being investigated by the relevant authorities , and Northwestern University is cooperating in this investigation , " said Cubbbage .	-11.4602
Warren is Senior Treasurer at Oxford University .	-1.7226
One speaker from the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the UK police and ready to help the US investigation authorities in every possible way ' .	-4.4289
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to be .	-2.8932
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago police authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said he is urging the suspects to stand up to the authorities .	-3.3615
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them strengthen , " said Guglielmi .	-3.0468
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-1.9097
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building administrator of the Grand-Lamza building , who had just received a puzzling tip saying that something happened in 1008 .	-7.6827
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9357
Guglielmi said that it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.7468
It was confirmed by safety cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.3890
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-2.0953
The management team of Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : " The police are currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and explores a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-5.2997
" We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future " - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko .	-2.9144
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said that it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented to restore the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.5297
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the roadmap , RUSADA has been given the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK anti-doping ) .	-3.8904
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this respect , " Mutko declared on Thursday .	-3.8920
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA 's road map to comply with the code that describes the criteria for re-establishing RUSADA and was recently published on the organization 's website .	-5.0516
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern .	-3.0786
" Everything was announced , everything is implemented .	-2.1055
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-2.0156
However , one of the criteria set out in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the study approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-4.7128
With regard to the matter , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has received a mistake .	-4.8100
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.3267
But there were no government programs , and we will not admit what does not exist . '	-3.3786
Mutkos 's words were consistent with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-2.5693
In talks with the Russian sales office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov gave problems of the past to Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-7.4684
No one has to accept this report unconditionally ' , added Smirnov .	-2.3914
RUSADA was ruled out by the WADA in November 2015 as a result of the doping scandal in Russia .	-4.4420
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.7794
After visiting the head of the organization 's headquarters in Moscow in July , WADA General Olivier Niggi explained that RUSADA is moving " in the right direction " to be used again .	-5.4419

The start-ups that will help your company not to be the next Uber .	-2.2996
Amy Savitt wanted to measure happiness among your employees in your e-Commerce startup , but the polls did not work .	-3.9918
Answers have often been vague , unhelpful or , worse still , fraudulent .	-2.6173
And even if you promise anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-3.1796
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Ertt , who runs the 75 litres of San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-4.0783
She has called for help from outside people .	-2.1299
A new breed of Human Resources startups is at the watch to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-3.3733
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee management , it allows companies to conduct surveys , raise special groups and demographic groups , offer staff anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases whispers allow managers to bypass the C suite and contact the board directly .	-6.2933
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health , but where is the fit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start Gleint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees ' commitment .	-4.0981
Savitt said that she had a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Gleint won .	-5.2078
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company showing at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low approval results - so that you can drill down why .	-6.2333
Companies come to understand that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture so that you do not become the next Uber who has been involved in scandal since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.7391
For startups like Gleint this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-2.6068
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Financial Web site Let ’ s Talk Payments .	-3.5785
Denver , Colorado , start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in discredit at the beginning of this year in the midst of the Uber case .	-3.8656
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.5844
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.8824
Like the Gleint , Convercent allows companies to send tailor-made " Puls- " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-6.0694
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-3.2360
And when the chief executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.9363
" The court of public opinion has collected regulators , " said Patrick Quintan , the founder and director of Convercent .	-4.2654
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or is unethical , it can experience costly consequences from consumer portfolios , worker feedback and complaints , Quinn said .	-6.0182
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and over 500 locations , Convercent has used for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their business center .	-6.1204
Previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the company headquarters , file a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-4.1733
It was often a intimidation and awkward experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to track staff complaints .	-4.2589
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems that were previously hidden by executives in offices in cities or states can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice .	-4.7223
" I can approach this holistic 360-degree view into employment experience , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.9644
'And we protect our shareholders from litigation ' .	-3.3472
Companies began to take more seriously ethics , values , and employee management in 2002 , after the accounting company Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical violations by the Enron scandal , Quintlan said .	-4.4462
But it took until the " Social media came to their right " that companies realized that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .	-5.1780
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.5783
Both Gleint and Convercent offer your software as a service , and burden companies with recurring charges for the use of their products .	-4.7464
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of venture capital investors who have supported both start-ups .	-3.5202
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising all capital to $ 47 million .	-3.1915
Glitzers secured $ 10 million in November from Besemerg Venture Partners , bringing all of its funding to $ 60 million .	-3.6678
These investments are hardly surprising , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.3231
There is a growing research complex that shows that today 's employees expect more from their jobs than they have done so far .	-3.9472
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-2.6961
The staff want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.0454
" If people are glad to be in a company that owns their voices , and that the work you do is worthwhile , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both convertible and Gleint .	-4.7536
Investors reach returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are engaged and committed .	-4.5904
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase employees ’ commitment and commitment , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.3071
Data on employee management according to workplace culture experts is important .	-2.9315
But data is useless if managers of a company do not take action .	-2.8102
Indeed , when a company asks for your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way .	-3.2564
And if change does not come quickly enough , or at all , it can discourage disappointments and discourage employees .	-3.3008
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , the company that has seen too much reliance on data collection .	-4.2506
" For if you will not follow employees ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.1333
Are you concerned with this ?	-2.5090
And who you do not care why should I ? '	-3.5169
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Gleint , so excitement .	-4.1299
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees , it was able to re-organize several teams within the company by the speed of decision making and the quality of communication , and to add a communication training to address the problems .	-5.3137
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights of its employees , and it hopes that in the long run this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-6.6623
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-4.0163
" And if you lose people , you lose also customers .	-2.4550
And if you lose customers , you will lose businesses .	-2.7213
The NCAA eliminates the two-day practices and makes a long day for Brussels	-4.4718
It 's going to be 23 : 00 , when a lot of UCLA players are on one side of the team 's new training fields on the campus .	-6.7274
Some have left their jersey upper parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of training .	-5.4977
For a good part of the team , these idle minutes are a lunch break .	-2.6752
Players who are enrolled in the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center at 6 : 30 on the next morning .	-4.7080
" This is a real Tretmühle for the boys next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora shortly before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.1976
The NCAA eliminated two day exercises to ease the load of players , and it actually extended their days - at least until the final on Friday .	-4.8214
Therefore , the UCLA ’ s first three training courses should start at 19 : 15 to meet the players ’ already completed schedule .	-5.6224
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Brussels postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Moras ’ s six seasons in Westwood .	-5.1708
They are expected to hold 18 exercises during August , 20 before the start of formal , , , , , or .	-7.5616
Mora said that he supported the NCAA rule change , even if they add another point to the player 's multiple routes .	-5.5958
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.1942
" And they simply pushed it through , they grabbed themselves further , they are great people .	-4.5545
I think that as soon as we get to Saturday and we have more time , it will really be great . '	-4.1966
UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which will not be an easy task , given the clear lines of its fields of an adjacent car park and the adjacent Luskim Center , a hotel of the upper class , which has already been advertised with footballs that cleared a safety net behind a goalpost .	-8.8716
Bruins-players will occupy the hotel this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem as soon as these rooms are available during the season .	-4.9632
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.0057
" This is a real problem , and it is not far removed to think that people rent a room there and then prepare to draw an exercise .	-4.8251
If you have the video tape from an exercise , it 's a pretty good deal .	-3.2520
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces at parking 8 .	-2.0675
We will do the best with what we have .	-1.1989
I am not too worried about that .	-3.2270
We have a plan . '	-1.0881
Facebook wants to intensify Tatsache-checking in the fight against counterfeit messages	-3.5217
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false messages to third-party reality auditors , and then show their results under the original post , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-6.4200
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify potential false messages and send them to process process auditors who may see results from the original article .	-6.5185
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced US presidential elections in 2016 .	-3.4371
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with the French electorate inundated with false stories in the run-up to the presidential elections in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they do not manage to quickly remove hateful postings as they did before the September elections .	-5.8095
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new facts review will be launched in the United States , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.4426
" In addition to the knowledge about which stories are contested by key auditors of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-5.5348
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature of the " related article " and will work on other changes to his messaging environment to reduce false messages .	-4.9372
Creation of a comic novel : A History of England	-3.5537
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a Squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970-s and 1980-s .	-4.2605
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy headquarters in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a political pharish Yorkshire man with a fondness for historical documents .	-6.3796
" I find it so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years " , he says woefully .	-3.5794
" What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hand . "	-2.1213
A Castle in England embraces the ages from the Middle Ages to the Age of Edward and documents the families who lived in Scotney .	-4.5800
It is not the first book of Rhodes , based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found emotionally unexpected .	-3.5906
" I only responded to the thumb pressure on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700-s who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.7329
" That is his thumb pressure !	-1.9255
And letters always cried out of smoke , because at that time they burned a fire because of the light .	-5.9029
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as if it were .	-3.0899
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.1092
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued " ) this seems to be all too beautiful to be true .	-5.1344
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives , and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted Hyene heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the ditch .	-4.8502
He wandered through the grounds and ruins of the old castle and spoke with landscapers , gardeners and sometimes with artists who worked on the illustrations of his book .	-4.5258
Then , at night he drank " whiskey and began to write " .	-2.2638
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.0692
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the officers just began to care about the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , cast it on the attic " .	-5.6713
diaries , letters from the period of English Empires , maps representing who possessed what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring " , says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight two families .	-5.4319
Lads , let everything go its way ! '	-5.0248
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a wider base , including The Labourer , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farming insurrection of 1381 .	-5.1307
" There is a record of a rebellion in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-4.2944
" The peasant rebellion began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good beginning .	-2.6310
Perhaps the two are interconnected ? '	-2.3312
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle , such as The Priest , which tells the story of the Jesuit author , who the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.8102
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the 18th century dirigler Arthur Darrell , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated ) (	-8.7660
The darrells are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : " Gentlemen seemed to be pretty Gauner , always make debts and spend money on things they could not afford .	-4.5238
Other generations of Darrell men killed their debt crises by marriaging rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to advertise peas ' .	-5.0278
After the end of his operation at the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-4.6624
He has taken a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of an early 20th century sanatorium , which has since been reclaimed by nature .	-5.7250
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.4154
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-0.9762
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the dammed life ' .	-4.7534
Campaign : Beacon of the Virgin in Rhöndorf for over 300 years .	-5.3114
The town of Bad Honnef started its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand ( Thursday 's round-trip ) with the contraceptive of the 301 year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf .	-6.9882
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret .	-2.7624
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth .	-3.2885
" Too beautiful for us .	-1.8112
Or ? , ask the machers of the action since yesterday on the posters at the Rhöndorfer chapel .	-4.9020

" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.7107
And to make it clear that much is better than it seems .	-3.0519
In fact , we firmly believe that as Bad Honnefer we know citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-5.0376
The action is about more than " just " one logo and a slogan , it goes on .	-3.9772
" We must formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique location " .	-3.6443
After all , they compete with other communities .	-2.1202

Turkey ’ s Military Reforms – Erdo<unk>an ’ s Fear of the Army	-4.1075
Each year in early August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on boarding and boarding in the Official Corps .	-4.5087
That is the same week .	-2.8685
At first glance a normal operation .	-2.3210
But nothing is routine with the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.8597
The sitting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as before , but in the Prime Minister 's seat .	-3.5027
The discussions have now also been attended by the five Deputy Prime Ministers , as well as the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .	-5.4902
The civilians in the YAS were thus overwhelming .	-3.6891
The government is dragging its feet in the military .	-2.4997
Chief of Staff , Hulusi Akar , remains in office , but the army ’ s commanders , the air force , and the navy were deposed .	-5.2217
Since the failed coup , head of state has fired Erdogan 169 of the 326 generals and admins .	-3.3001
More than 10,000 troops were removed from the army , mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exiled editor-in-exile Fethullah Gülen , who Erdo<unk>an sees as the leader of the coup attempt .	-6.6569
There have been negotiations in Ankara since this week against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-4.4168
Already on the day after the coup , Erdo<unk>an had called the crash attempt a " gift to God " because he gave him the opportunity to " completely clean " the armed forces .	-6.4837
But has Erdo<unk>an really got the army under control ?	-2.1803
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürtriyet " published an article entitled " unease in the military headquarters " .	-3.7622
In general , there are concerns about the increasing " Islamicisation " of the army , which , among other things , manifests itself in lifting the ban on the headscarf of soldiers , the newspaper wrote .	-6.1660
In any case , the army and the security forces are sending .	-4.4532
In mid-July , Erdogan , by decree , fired more 7395 civil servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-4.0350
It seemed that Erdogan had tamed the military .	-2.7271
The generals used to be the actual masters of the country .	-2.7797
Three times , they appealed to their role as guardians of the secular order .	-4.6241
Following his victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed the military ’ s power back step by step , not least by calling on the reform objectives of the European Union .	-4.8486
Former officers say , Erdo<unk>an is deliberately pushing ahead with the armed forces ’ Islamicisation . include , , and . , , , , and . , , , , , , , , , and ,	-8.8410
In the magazine " Vocal Europe " , a notably non-named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad , the Turkish army will be " full of extremists and Salafists " in a few years .	-4.6152
If that is the case , such a development could not make NATO cold .	-4.1187
At any rate , after the purges , the alliance has doubts about the Turkish army ’ s operational readiness .	-4.0884
The leadership structures and operational capabilities are ' weakened ' , say NATO diplomats .	-2.6977
Washington Changing the rules of the Green Card	-2.7769
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-1.5831
It proposes reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family oriented visas .	-4.0117
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the president .	-1.7129
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-2.4188
" This law will reduce poverty , raise wages , and save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way citizens from other countries are issued Green Cards . "	-3.9471
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-2.1961
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " said Trump , quoted by the American media .	-5.0386
The Ministry wants to renovate the route for Racines Shuttle	-9.0347
Over the past few months , discussions about the future of the race shuttle had repeatedly been held - now it should be done very quickly .	-7.2137
Before the end of the year it is planned to be built on the marred track , on which the tourist train runs .	-7.7007
According to the Ministry of Transport , construction works on the track will begin this year .	-4.9937
" With the decision to continue to order and repair the route Ilmenau-Racsteig , the country is committed to this important link , especially for tourism , " said Transport Secretary Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-6.3153
The cost of repairing the track was estimated at around EUR 2.5 million .	-3.6225
Of this sum , the country represents 75 % .	-2.4299
The shuttle was ordered by the USS Enterprise-D in the future , and was , , and the of .	-11.6971
The Ministry and the South thüringen Railway as operator are already agreed on the technical details .	-4.2772
" That 's why the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards are negotiated , " said Swhl .	-4.7953
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be closed for a period of eleven years .	-3.5010
The race run shuttle is scheduled to be ordered regularily on December 2017 .	-4.1988
The Rennsteig Shuttle is a popular rail link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially for tourists .	-6.7526
Over the past few months , a pilot has been tested to see whether the route is being used by enough people to re-regulate it in the future .	-6.2011
The track is also poorly covered in parts .	-4.4401
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned about it .	-1.7123
Just when you thought that it cannot become even more crazy in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the sex robots is coming .	-4.6970
Yes , indeed .	-1.1818
Sex-robots are a big thing at the moment .	-2.8768
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-2.3041
According to Noel Sharkey , an emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR , we must begin to take its rise seriously .	-4.3100
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the breast candle and the type of fingernail .	-3.3511
" People are making fun about them , but companies are getting a lot of it , and we will see them even more often , " said Mr Sharkey when publishing his new report .	-6.3035
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners into robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with conscious human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.6655
The user can also " adapt " his robot according to his beliefs , choosing everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-5.0357
But it becomes even more disturbing , as many robots have the " personages " that would make a Stepford woman look progressive .	-4.8264
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.5135
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as boldness .	-5.2931
And then there is the Roxixy Gold Sex-robot , developed by True Companion , with pre-programmed figures such as " Frigid Farrah " , which gives the impression of scanty and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-6.0175
" Roxxxx.y Gold has a personality that is adapted to your personality as best as possible " , disguises the website of True Companion .	-5.4909
However , she likes what you like , and she doesn 't like what you don 't like , etc . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.6316
Over the course of the day , she also has voice - just like real people !	-5.3448
She can be tired of talking to conversation or she can be " in mood " !	-3.4262
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they are replacing real human relationships - but the hidden female characteristics , allusions to rape when one step is taken to Frigid ( that is to say here : repugning ) Farrah , worry one most .	-7.1600
On his site True Companion Roxxxx.y compared with a toy , but for men .	-4.3162
" If women ( sic ) can have a Vibrator , why can men not have Roxxxx.y ? " is it on the website .	-5.8362
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or a mere sex toys .	-3.7556
Their emergence and their increasing refinement point to something Dungeons and lows in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with subjugation as an optional addition .	-4.9593
Most men will not , of course , hold any sex robots , and while the FRR discovers its growing popularity , they remain at the edge of consumer culture .	-6.0798
But what is going through the peripheral areas can be very instructive in terms of the spirit of the time we live in .	-4.9042
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-1.7681
There is a certain overlap that these highly developed sex robots will emerge at a time when women ’ s rights are at risk worldwide , when there is a president in the White House who has boasted of having sexually attacked women .	-5.7517
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) is not the graphic images , the convoluted bodies and the faded eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.7105
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a big leap .	-3.0827
The aim behind this sex robot is to produce a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible ( though with pornshare proportions ) .	-5.0797
Their builders want to feel humanely that they imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.4192
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , robots are not real women .	-2.8747
They cannot be separated or simply removed from their pets .	-4.1688
They have no mediation or a background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total subjugation .	-3.8353
In other words , they are makeshift slaves .	-1.9482
Or to put it in the rhetoric of 2017 : nannies	-4.0773
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.4230
He turns Mitt Romney into the commonsense sense sense sense sense sense sense	-4.0700
It has become a truism in the Trump era that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate also split families in small format .	-3.1794
Around Christmas and Harvest Day , newspapers were advised in the US about how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s favorite relatives .	-4.3559
We are all supposedly tough to burst our filter bubbles .	-3.9455
Less noticed has been the power of Trump to bring families together .	-1.5624
I mention this because my cousin , a leftist poet living in Chicago and working with Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-2.9450
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.7818
With Trump at the White House , everyone who knows , including the Republican kinship with which she fought for decades of politics , is suddenly on the same side in a strange way .	-5.4941
To the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-4.5712
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .	-3.7133
When we talk about ' normalisation ' and Trump , we are talking about the gruesome possibility that one day his kittens will no longer bite off .	-5.2574
But there is an even more frightening long-term scenario in which Trump “ normalizes ” Republican of the right wing , which suddenly appear to be a concept of commonsense in comparison to his standards .	-5.6730
Today , I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s original version of the deceased – the car roof dog , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration was issued ) – both of which , in fact , are considered a very lenient crime compared to Trump .	-7.5182
If Trump is going , the next Republican candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as an immeasurable improvement .	-3.7465
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Karousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York Park 's Carousels , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-5.5821
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are crispy and the animals are twisted to look filled with fear of their own shoulders - extremely dark and the powerful music conveys this in a strange way .	-5.6212
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the sky lines are too familiar to offer much excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.3948
Fifty years later , and I am still not quite over the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss Cottage - the Theme Carol Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a big round-about in North London .	-6.2672
However , the Central Park carousel is still a strange magical experience , as here two years old , one 11-year-old and two women in the 40-year-old years can go on it and all have a great time .	-7.1003
If I could have assessed the Carousel , I would have given him the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-4.1081
On the other hand , in a department store this week , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale of one to five stars before I could get through my credit card .	-3.7652
In the cafe at the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to adjust the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the shop table .	-4.2411
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation in which no need is made .	-7.6152
The poor woman in the department store apologized , while I tired of making her my credit card rich with five stars .	-6.1993
Oscar Pistorius moved from prison to hospital with breast pain .	-3.1339
Pistorius left the prison for a hospital visit for the second time .	-2.2211
Last year , he was brought to hospital because of the treatment of cuts on his handrails , which , according to the prison authorities , he suffered in his cell after a case .	-5.2301
Pistorius was convicted of murdering a public prosecutor 's plea against a first death sentence .	-4.1958
He killed the Steenkamp in the early morning of Valentine 's Day in 2013 , bringing her several times through a door to the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria .	-4.6261
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a nocturnal interlude hidden in the cabin .	-3.9909
prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , from which they say it is too lenient .	-3.9419
The National Court of Justice said that it would appeal to the South Africa Supreme Court and that the appeal could be heard this year .	-3.6035
Pistorius risks increasing his penalty to 15 years if prosecutors are successful .	-5.0282
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8422
A Bauer of Arnold a curious egg	-3.5916
As the last of the Blumberger schools , the four classmates were dismissed from feet and Epfenhofen in the holidays and in the secondary schools .	-5.7619
Three of the school leavers are going to high school , four to the secondary school .	-5.1444
On Tuesday evening , schoolleader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bisental Civic Centre in Epfenhofen .	-5.0842
As a symbol of the school ’ s dismissal , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder , chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm , but then released into freedom .	-6.1556
In addition , the ensemble performed a musical entitled " Der Adler im Härnerhof on " .	-6.0338
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and caused it to be scarred by his chickens .	-3.9163
Instead of a chicken , a little eagle came out .	-2.7082
But the hope to make a chicken out of him disintegrated , the eagle spread his wings and disappeared on a high mountain .	-5.1149
The classes then showed three and four in the determination of Yvonne Frank a chicken dance .	-3.9846
The Henns danced with the young gocks that wore cylinders to the bet .	-5.1369
The Adler stands for integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.4297
The kittens are different from the other kittens , but they belong to them .	-4.7089
He will never be like a chicken .	-1.1999
Its purpose is to be free .	-2.5826
She wanted everyone to feel at home in his new school .	-4.5262
It was followed by thanks to fellow MEPs , former head of school Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps into teaching emergencies , and to parents .	-6.9308
The chick season is now over , says school teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.7382
She leaves her students very reluctant after two years of teaching , because it was really a great time .	-4.9899
In the end , they were able to rely on the fourth-wingers .	-5.5189
At the end , all pupils performed a song of summer and holiday time .	-4.3462
The children enjoyed a great deal of fun in .	-4.1358
Eight first class pupils are already registered for the new school year .	-4.5809
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.1005
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece , told the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-3.2205
On the morning of 1 August in Sithonia , a group of illegal people were arrested by the police , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.3681
On the same day , they were released while an investigation is under way .	-3.2099
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported that the Bulgarians were released later .	-2.3950
The Greek authorities have tightened control of free camping and impose significant fines on anyone who is found to stay in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.8881
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-2.2874
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-1.8523
Software update for diesel cars : What the people affected need to know now .	-3.9504
How exactly is the software update taking place ?	-1.7555
Do diesel drivers have to participate in the action ?	-2.6288
Overview of the most important questions and answers .	-1.8034
At the diesel summit BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group have offered software updates for a total of 5.3 million cars .	-2.7817
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .	-4.0377
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-3.5587
Anaja Smetanin of the ACE Auto Club Europa gives opinions :	-4.7786
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.3575
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.3276
" The mandatory updates before apply only to the vehicles that have casino software " , says Anja Smetanin .	-5.0699
The German Federal Power Agency ( KBA ) has ordered its rearmament .	-5.0007
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.0373
The manufacturers have announced that they will be implemented quickly in the next few months , but they have not yet set a precise date .	-5.7473
Daimler has announced that it is up to everyone concerned .	-3.9611
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be done within its framework .	-2.9540
How long should the overall regear be pulled ?	-4.3798
" Hard to say " , says Smetanin .	-2.1384
This depends on manufacturers ' commitment and on political pressure .	-3.4601
" We have seen that car manufacturers are not acting voluntarily on the environment . "	-4.5871
How long should the update take ?	-1.5901
The rearrangement itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.4822
It might be more expensive to get an appointment .	-3.0093
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group ?	-2.8742
The ACE lectures to wait .	-3.3296
It is likely that foreign producers would follow suit , Smetanin .	-4.5318
Will a massive price fall in Euro 4 cars be threatened ?	-3.5592
That is what ACE feared .	-2.7223
But it is precisely in the regions where there is a threat of travel bans .	-4.4977
There has been no loss of value in rural areas for older diesel .	-3.3460
ACE advises to wait with a sale .	-3.7217
LL Cool J received Kennedy Center Award	-3.3440
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.3598
The first prize-giving ceremony under President Trump promises to become political .	-2.2367
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-2.4083
LL Cool J ( 49 ) becomes the first rapper to win one of the prestigious Kennedy Center awards .	-2.8845
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the visitors .	-3.3643
The awards will be awarded in early December .	-2.3456
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host and participate in the award with his wife , Melania .	-3.3609
The award-winning Lear , who was born with progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the Gala .	-5.3667
He said to the New York Times : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - and even cut them off - and that puts me under pressure ' .	-5.7194
The 59-year-old Estefan has stressed that she will use the discussion with Trump to clarify her point of view .	-3.8910
The Kennedy Center , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-1.9764
Among the earlier awards are Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-3.3804
We make the City Life	-2.7178
Roland Wacker , Haslah ’ s urban carpenter , will retire next year .	-3.9066
The job is already posted - suitable candidates are scarce .	-3.5489
Wacker Stadtbauster has been operating for 31 years .	-2.7266
And the work still gives him great fun as he presents in the press .	-4.5676
He reports varied but also demanding tasks waiting for his successor .	-3.2431
At the same time , he is surprised that no application complies with the requirements specifications .	-4.5459
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the next possible time .	-4.0328
In accordance with the regular termination deadlines , therefore , there is still enough time to complete the contract .	-7.6072
Since Haslach is a member of the Administrative Community as a sub-authority , the Applicant must provide appropriate accounts .	-6.4461
This function will certainly keep the city .	-3.9528
If they can no longer fill them , citizens would have to go to the advice of Offenburg .	-6.0258
But proximity to the city and to its citizens is important , says Wacker , who reports about a good business climate and a good mood between the authorities and citizens .	-6.6768
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects have been gathered , which Wacker has been proud of .	-6.8764
" We make the city alive " , he is assured of the construction office and his employees .	-5.3886
In the future , however , varied projects are on the agenda : the renovation of the former Hukla-Areals and the Niederhofenpark square is around the corner .	-7.7159
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , and the theatre is still topic .	-4.7243
Wacker estimates that the latter alone will cost around EUR 1.5 million if we do it right .	-5.1632
" All in all , great tasks await my successor .	-1.9864
The work here is fun . '	-1.5105
Constructively , there is ample room for a town builder .	-4.7498
With Haslakh 's own building yard and garden garden , many things can be reacted very flexibly .	-5.8801
" There can be a lot of movement " , says Wacker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.3236
As the old town as an ensemble is classified as a monument , it is important to have an eye for what fits in when new buildings are approved , the outgoing town builder emphasizes .	-6.9750
At any rate , the town architect has a high responsibility .	-3.6333
He is a owner , " everything is going through my table at the end " .	-5.9019
For the management and coordination he can count on many years of staff : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been present for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Baubau ) for 15 years .	-7.9219
Also that his successor remains long , Wacker wishes : " We are looking for someone who wants to with the place " " .	-5.7462
After all , continuity is important not only for a good business climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-4.0320
According to the information given by the town of Haslach , who would like to bury Roland Wacker , would like to present a graduated degree as a civil engineer or a Bachelor of Expertise in Architecture and have good knowledge of the field of construction and construction law .	-10.4346
The City Office is responsible for the construction and construction of buildings , construction planning , primary work matters , administration of the urban properties , the Municipal Works Office with Bauhof and the Municipal Municipal District District District District Cathedral as well as the Lower Building Authority , including heritage protection .	-13.5497
Bicycle thrown on lines : South track closed .	-3.3199
According to the police , the hitherto unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the rail navigation in the area of Leober Street ( B116 ) on the lines .	-6.5529
They were so badly damaged that the nearby freight train had to be stopped .	-4.0883
Examiners pass from two men and have been looking for them since the night .	-5.4416
Near the gate a scooter and a bicycle driver were observed by witnesses . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.6929
" This goes far beyond a train station " , said <unk>BB-spokesman Christoph Posch to APA .	-5.5598
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger and would also have endangered rail transport .	-5.5302
In addition to the damage to the train and the facility as well as the minutes of delay and the costs of rail transport , the train customers could still pay the offenders .	-8.0565
All in all , it is to be expected of a " substantial " sum , said the speaker .	-5.3612
The damages were fixed again on Friday afternoon , rail traffic on the southern railway route could be done without disabilities .	-6.0167
Almost ten passenger trains were Friday morning , two of them related to long-distance traffic .	-4.3551
Goods trains were not lost , but they were delayed .	-3.8383
According to <unk>BB-spokesman Christoph Posch , around 200 metres of secondary lines had to be replaced .	-6.0919
Insulators and masts were also damaged .	-1.7628
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory disease ) .	-2.8557
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.4183
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory bowel disease .	-3.8298
The incurable state , which affects roughly 1.3 million in the US and 300 000 in the UK , causes stomach infections and vesicles , recurrent or bloody diarrhea , weight loss and extreme fatigue .	-5.4639
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at the Washington University found that the essential amino acid tryptophan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestinal tract .	-8.5617
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that cells in the intestinal tract are patrolling to ensure that harmful microbes hidden in food do not penetrate the body .	-5.3344
Cells capable of triggering inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissue .	-3.0310
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it may lead to inflammatory disease .	-4.6193
In experiments , a kind of tolerance promoting immunity occurs in the mice that a particular bacterium carries in its hands .	-5.3205
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of cells .	-2.9849
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a connection between a bacterial - lactaobacillus familiarising - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbioms , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .	-6.5235
The more tryptophan had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells " .	-2.4348
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promotes more tolerant , less inflammable intestinal milieus , when the same system also affects humans .	-5.6757
Postdoktorandin Dr. Luisa Cervant-Barragan studied a kind of immuncell that promotes tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was divided , did not .	-6.9013
It believed that the difference had to do with the microbial phenomenon of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi that usually live in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.9953
The mice ’ s jamming were transformed into DNA sequences and six bacteria species were found that were present in the mice with the immune cells , but without them missing in the mice .	-7.4867
The mice were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked microom and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they obtained the L. Cross and the immune cells .	-5.8673
In order to understand how the bacteria worked on the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by the mice .	-4.7046
The immune cells evolved to the cells promoting tolerance .	-3.3264
When the active component from the liquid was cleaned , it proved to be a by-product of the Tryptophan metabolism known as indoor 3-milk acid .	-4.4358
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but if the triptophan values were halved , the number of cells declined by half .	-4.1637
Dr. Cervante-baragan explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us L. ruteri protect in our gastrointestinal tract .	-4.6969
It is not known whether triptophan by-products from L. reuniteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes in relation to Tryptophan were found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-10.3526
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-3.5447
Potentially , high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population . '	-5.7091
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-1.9961
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , believes Jose Mourinho , after the midfielder had his debut against Sampraia on Wednesday evening .	-4.7731
Chelsea ’ s 40 million pound signature began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last season game before the UEFA SuperCup against Real Madrid begins Tuesday , and impressed in the role of the Guard when people such as Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to their liking .	-6.8045
However , Matic had been excluded from the blues ’ s Preparatory Asian tour and made only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-5.8264
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-2.0333
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.6911
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukakku launched their first season in Aviva-City , when Mourinho formed his first start XI for the season .	-7.1709
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to fulfill three of its four major commitments .	-4.4923
" To get three of four , for which I thank the association " , he added .	-3.2334
'I will be happier if they receive four of my four , but they have taken a great deal of trouble ' .	-5.0252
Boeing ' White Dreamliner in the Sky	-3.7635
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing brought the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky .	-3.3673
The pilot flew from Seattle in the U.S. State of Washington , but the plot started in Marquette in U.S. State Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the USA , which are several thousand kilometres .	-6.7731
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.9825
On the radar screens was the form of a Dreamliner .	-2.4201
It was a endurance test for new engines .	-2.4284
Boeing had already made such advertising earlier .	-1.6553
So the number " 787 " and the Boeing-logo was painted into the sky .	-3.8014
We have a problem with Martin Schulz - Hannover .	-2.5954
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still the leader of the SPD , social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-5.0992
Only no disturbance from the party center , only no counterwind from the federal government , was the most important wish of the campaign .	-7.0333
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-1.8861
Since then , the employees of the Willy-Brandt-Haus with growing dismay are watching events in the SPD ruling national capitals .	-5.5227
What Schulz received since the beginning of the year would not even have been described in the approach with headwinds .	-6.9138
It was low prices .	-2.3496

The Federal CDU sees the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony as a general signal against coalitions of the SPD and the Greens .	-3.6832
" This shows once again : Rot-Grün simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany ( RCD ) .	-5.4662
The surprising group is leaving a Green MEP who has pushed the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-4.6812
Five months before the country election , his red-green coalition thus lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-3.8183
The Green Chief , Michael Keltner , has asked the breakaway Dutch Green MEP Elke Twsten to return her mandate .	-5.2654
The violation of the CDU means a clear falsification of the voter 's will .	-4.4721
Elke Twsten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and campaign leader of the Green Group to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-6.2276
" All this must not be true , " it is a SPD electoral fighter who sees the new Hiobsbotschaft reach the party center on Friday morning .	-8.8743
Stephan Weil , the Social Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , is there to the CDU without its own majority after the Green MEP Elke Twentisten took over .	-7.3968
It is the provisional culmination of a whole series of large and small crises in SPD national associations .	-4.2337
And no one knows what will happen next .	-1.9253
The disaster began with the unexpectedly significant defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-2.8494
A blue eye , no more , the comrades at the time calmed down .	-3.7206
After the regional elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia everything will be different .	-3.5645
This has also been done - and it has all been much worse .	-5.1498
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD to the Taumeln , who in Düsseldorf broke the party smoothly .	-5.2881
In the weeks after that , the comrades stood up again .	-6.6481
Then , when they had just launched new courage , the G-20 summit of Hamburg came .	-4.2722
And with him came the next shot .	-1.4645
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD leader , lost his nemesis this weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-4.7341
And because , in crisis communication , he then made almost everything wrong .	-4.4311
Since then , Scholz has been struggling for his political survival .	-1.1536
So now Stephan Weil .	-1.8368
The German Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticised for some time now because of the German exhaust gas companies and its role in the supervisory board .	-5.2402
Miose query values were added .	-3.7067
Despite this , or perhaps precisely because of this , in recent weeks , it has been trying to make a stronger contribution to the federal government .	-8.4691
The ambition of the former Mayor of Hanover to extend his power in Berlin did not remain hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .	-4.6023
They left him because they promised that the party would be stabilised by Weil .	-10.2316
Now the exact opposite could happen .	-3.1188
It is because the Greens in the Niedersachsen region are in no way responsible for the partisan dispute .	-5.9596
And Schulz is not .	-2.7635
At times , therefore , the comrades are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.9245
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and especially at the breakaway parliamentarian tweists .	-4.4080
" It is insufferable and anti-democratic , as Mrs Tweest puts her own career interests above the interests of all others " , says Matthias Miersch , leader of the party left in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( RCD ) .	-6.9597
Mrs Twsten was elected to parliament not for her person as a direct candidate , but on the Lower Saxony Green regional list , the Lower Saxony MEP continues .	-6.3535
The logical consequence is that it will give back its mandate .	-2.8535
Thomas Oppemann , head of the SPD Bundestag , laments an " undemocratic manoeuvre " .	-3.8185
" The popular will four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil the Prime Minister , " said Oppermann , who leads the Lower SPD to the federal election , the RND .	-5.9203
" Now the personal career trends of a future members of the CDU are distorting the election result , " said Oppermann .	-5.7915
He called for the background to be clarified .	-2.6489
I should like to know whether more has been made of this , or whether the CDU Lower Saxony has given further assurances .	-6.3820
Community aid to Town Centre III	-4.1415
Anyone who wants to have his own house restored for years can soon receive support from the country .	-5.6960
In addition , the Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Urban Development will be in Sensingen on Wednesday .	-7.4479
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a glimpse of what has happened .	-4.5604
Since 1991 there have been conservation areas .	-3.3164
At that time , in the I. settlement area from 1991 to 2004 , the state of Baden-Wuerttemberg took over two-thirds of the total support .	-5.8893
In the II recovery area from 2005 to 2016 , the grant was still at 60 % .	-6.9006
For motorists , past restorations are a " success project " - it is , after all , important to promote internal development and not just to open up new areas of construction .	-7.0881
On April 4 , the Government 's seat of Karlsruhe was informed that there will be a III redevelopment area .	-5.0273
The sum of funding was EUR 833 333 , of which EUR 500 000 came from the country , the rest of the community felt .	-4.4154
What is the origin of a rehabilitation area ?	-3.1365
You will continue to investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.2118
However , it is also a matter of whether there is any interest in the area envisaged .	-5.5343
If necessary , regional borders could then be put off again .	-3.6455
The STEC represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-2.1483
Keller presented the contents of the Bund country program " Social City " , in which the remediation would then be carried out .	-3.6327
At the heart of the programme is the revitalization of inner cities , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and expansion of infrastructure .	-4.7980
The measures would be taken objectively , i.e. per property .	-4.1048
The rehabilitation area would then be defined as a Statute .	-4.1768
The grant period has run until 30 April 2026 since 1 January 2017 .	-3.1633
However , until September of this year , we would once again be taking stock of how those involved in the recovery area would receive a questionnaire on filling in .	-7.2207
In November or December , as far as possible the adoption decision should be taken so that the sanctions can be started next year .	-5.7266
Pietzschmann then explained that each municipality must carry out the aforementioned preliminary investigations .	-3.5469
It is a question of assessing the urban defects and deciding when to renovate them and to what extent .	-5.3809
A statement of cancellation in the Property will be added for each property .	-6.3556
Pietzschmann will come to feel again and take a picture of the situation , she promised .	-4.3174
He said that a major success factor for the project was the participation of the participants .	-5.6511
There will therefore be questionnaires sent to the citizens in the coming weeks , which can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-4.2976
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and land sheet " , which deals with building conditions and recovery plans .	-5.7891
In the grey questionnaire , the " Household and Housing Arch " , you can specify the size , distribution and residents of a living room .	-4.9502
The blue " operational bow " can only be completed if business premises are operated in the building .	-5.4686
Please note , Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not at the same time an application for funding .	-3.9982
Moreover , new building measures are not eligible .	-2.8438
Schindler also stressed that the distribution of the funds works according to the ' greyhound principle ' - who comes first , first warns .	-6.3972
You cannot " reserve " funds for later on .	-4.3851
Finally photos of the project " Centre II " were shown to make a " tasting " of the present .	-6.3880
British inventors set themselves a microchip to come with a hand movement in house and car .	-4.2810
A British inventor is the first in the country equipped with a microchip to open his own door , enter his office and even start his car with a handheld .	-4.5400
Steven Northam , 33 , had placed the tiny chip between thumb and pointer and now offers the service to companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology by his company BioTeq .	-4.5471
He has teamed up with Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory consultant at Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant process is carried out according to medical standards .	-4.7413
The technology resembles a cat and dog implant microchip and takes only 30 seconds .	-3.2000
The company of Mr Northam would also like to change the locks at houses and cars in such a way that they are compatible with the chip , all at an additional cost of <unk> 300 per castle .	-3.9379
The married father of one has now integrated both at home and in his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is on the wheel .	-4.3404
White House advertising costs taxpayers thousands	-1.6300
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to military data left to the TIME magazine .	-4.1724
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July at the White House with American construction programs .	-4.4162
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and White House senior officials made a tour of products from all 50 countries .	-3.1997
The helicopters made in Connecticut were issued alongside a Maine yacht , a car fire brigade from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-6.9996
The White House military office required the presence of the helicopter in a fragmented order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-5.2331
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the commander of HMX 1 on the eve of the event his predecessor , the deputy marine commander for aviation .	-4.9124
The news showed that on 17 July , the helicopter met South Lawn at 3 p.m. on 7 a.m. for the event , and so long before the pitch was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-9.7369
The note adds that if the departure from the White House is delayed , a second crew would be required for the return flight due to the limitation of service hours .	-5.4244
The original flight crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unity security staff remained on the ground during the time .	-5.6022
From the records provided by the TIME , it was not clear whether a second flight crew was required .	-5.1356
The Hatch Act prohibits federal workers from using state property for political purposes .	-2.5510
Data sets indicate that HMX 1 asked whether the event could violate the provision .	-3.3919
" One question we asked was whether it was a breach of Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.3777
" Blast as if you were closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-4.4988
The " Made in America " event was designated as an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.9568
But official events also have political overtones .	-0.9324
At the event , the President gave an impetus to reform the health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb government regulations .	-5.5137
The use of the aircraft known as Marine One or Air Force One for politically beneficial purposes is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.8073
Presidents are obliged to use them for their journey .	-2.5594
But asking for their use only for a photo editor is unusual .	-4.0941
Trump conducted a study in February , when the presidential aircraft performed taxi services in Melbourne , Florida , in the background of his first campaign rally rally rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessors .	-6.0382
" The White House is enthusiastic about the " Made In America " show - products from all 50 countries produced by American workers with American materials , " said the White House Vice Secretary of the Press , Lindsay Walters .	-5.3766
HMX 1 crews frequently carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn in order to counter US presidents at the White House with accurate Zentems .	-7.0102
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany at the beginning of July , HMX 1 carried out 58 training landings in the White House .	-3.8190
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted in the training needs of flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-4.6183
Helicopter units additionally served 11 hours this day for " Non-Presidential Support missions " .	-3.1399
The White House said that taxpayers were not responsible for any of the other acquisitions that were presented at the event .	-3.5809
A Sikorsky spokesman said that the company had not been involved in distributing the helicopter on South Lawn .	-4.1086
HMX 1 does not have budget records for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.0796
However , according to the US Defense Department 's hourly rates for the 2017 financial year , the DoD reimbursement rate for the VH-3D is $ 24.380 per hour .	-5.4810
In the United States , the Navy is the largest aircraft in the United States .	-10.0212
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is well below this rate .	-2.1338
'Setting the cost of taxpayers on the basis of the estimates for the reimbursement rates is highly misleading , ' said Walters .	-4.6364
'These estimates include personnel , maintenance and many other hidden costs , which are included in the annual funds ' .	-3.6365
According to a 2015 RAND study , the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-4.2121
At that time , the White House ’ s former press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter ’ s use for the event .	-3.0738
" The idea is to present this week things that are produced in America , " said Spicer .	-2.6442
" And I know that Sikorsky and the federal state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , of people depend on it .	-3.2551
And I think that , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-3.8318
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.2417
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he took his tour of South Lawn for the event , but he was in a firecar driver ’ s seat .	-4.5546
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky ’ s representative and raised with the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-4.1077
'I know Sikorsky very well ' , the President said , ' I have three of them . '	-2.0860
TC BW Neuss in front of tricky task .	-2.6789
Top runner of the second national tennis league joins the content-third search portal SV .	-7.2479
The TC Blue Weiss Neuss will kick in from 11 o 'clock tomorrow in Kiel at the content-third Suckdorfer SV .	-6.8844
In spite of five games , the top row of the second national tennis league still has a flawless record of reality .	-7.8670
Team chef Marius Zay has respect for his opponent .	-3.7236
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar band .	-2.5800
Especially on the back positions I find the team very good . '	-2.5711
For class and stability in the search field SV , especially imports from the High North .	-7.2195
" Their Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis-Cup .	-2.8292
And they are also strong in double " , says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olsen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Nahreus ( all Denmark ) .	-4.3577
" This becomes , as always , difficult for us .	-3.2699
As you also need a good portion of luck . "	-3.6258
The Neusser team is practically perfect for the trip to the north .	-4.7988
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janfour .	-2.0436
If the currently active French French player is not yet on the Challenger tournament in the Italian province of Biella , the Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) , who will play the tournament in the Czech Republic , will become the first player in this season .	-9.5628
The previously undignified Chileans Hans Podlipcik Castillo was still on the ball yesterday with the Belarussian Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel .	-6.2317
In Kiel , however , he should be as present as botic Van de Zandvoorhy , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgian Julien Cagnina .	-5.6875
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkusz could once again join the team .	-6.1217
Is it not sufficient for the 18-year-old Hungary , which was still number one of the world ’ s junior league in January 2016 , someone from the traineeship around Marius Zay is filling up the cadres .	-5.4012
How America Can Destroy OMV	-2.8497
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed the law on tightening sanctions against Russia on Wednesday evening .	-3.7033
" In his haste to pass the law , " he packed , predicted , a few " unconstitutional rules " to Congress . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.6405
The reaction from Moscow , too , was as harsh as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US advance .	-4.7917
After all , the draft provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.2829
Thus , investors have since been concerned by the domestic OMV , which together with other European companies co-financed the construction of the Russian Nord Stream 2 Baltic Sea pipeline .	-5.8010
The threat scene is immense .	-3.6714
But it is too early to assess the consequences , such as the official statement of the oil group .	-3.9134
In fact , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by means of Executive Order .	-3.5697
Twelve weapons are on his table .	-3.8449
" The press " has considered which of the group could defend and which could really hurt it .	-5.2871
Narcos Squadron 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar the Cali Cartel will be placed in the hit series by Netflix .	-3.7602
Despite the second season of Narcos revealing Pablo Escobar Killer , the series of Netflix is far from over .	-3.2915
The three and four stackers have already been confirmed by the streaming service , the first received their first trailer and presented the latest performers at the show .	-5.2702
With the third season , the DEA has focused its attention on the world 's richest organization of drug trafficking : the Cali Party .	-4.3268
Led by four powerful sponsors , they operate " like a Fortune 500 company " only with more government bribery and violent actions .	-3.6964
Gilberto Rodriguez Orejuela ( Damian Alcazar ) is the leader of the cartel , Miguel Rodriguez Oreja Juuela ( Francisco Denis ) is her head , Pacho Herrera ( Alberto Ammann ) commands the Mexican link , and Chepe Santacruz Londono ( Pepe Rapazote ) is located in New York .	-5.8187

Roll back : The city has given 46 kitchen aids .	-3.7154
The city organizes the Kita lunch table again itself .	-4.6801
With permanent contact partners for the children and a assignment to the team .	-6.1084
The clock is rotated back in urban nurseries .	-2.7675
The city of Krefeld takes over the food supply in the urban children ’ s day facilities ( Kitas ) in its own capital .	-7.2034
For Sonja Pommeranz , Deputy Head of Youth Welfare , this is a good news : ' We were all delighted with it ' .	-5.1282
A caterer takes this task out of the house and supplies fresh chilled .	-5.6176
The town operates 46 day-care centres in Krefeld , and in 44 the children receive a warm meal at lunch time .	-5.0912
In the past Kitajus , there are 2800 children at the tables each , and the need is growing steadily .	-5.7711
" In the meantime , not only do children who are cared for 45 hours a week eat at midday in the Kita , " explains Pommeranz .	-5.4808
" The offer also applies in the 35-hour service if children stay until 2pm " .	-5.5122
46 part-time staff have kitchen service from 1 September : they are considering the food delivered , supplement it with salad , raw vegetables and fruits , portioning the meal individually , give out food , rooms , rinse and clean the kitchen .	-9.1782
" The employees are firmly associated with a kita " , says Pommeranz .	-4.8292
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the scope of the hour .	-7.8592
" The kitchen workers now belong firmly to the Kita team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-3.8910
" So they are much more involved and it is easier to apply pedagogical concepts for the kiteeping .	-5.2212
It is also a question of healthy nutrition and cooking lessons .	-3.3940
" Children should help prepare food " .	-2.9092
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.1945
Also for children .	-2.8487
" They have a known force in the kita , a person who is familiar to them and not constantly changing people " .	-3.8029
This continuity is important for children .	-1.6268
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - which has also been the task of the kitchen staff - will be done by special cleaning staff in the future .	-6.4926
In addition to the quality improvement of the kitchen service , this variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - also has the charm that it has shown to be the most economic in comparison to the cost of its own and foreign aid to the city , it is said from the press office .	-9.7040
This is despite the fact that 46 part-time workers are being re-employed .	-3.6381
" But these hours are not so much in weight for some 750 people in education , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-4.8222
Afghan democracy depends on the political role of women , says the UN .	-2.3705
Elections can only be representative if all members of society , including women , play a role , the head of the UN mission in Afghanistan said on Wednesday .	-2.2146
Nicholas Haysom , President-in-Office of the United Nations Mission , said that hundreds of women will run in the provincial elections , with three women running for the role of the Vice-President and more than 30 % of newly registered voters .	-4.7549
" The role of women cannot be overestimated , " he said in a statement on Wednesday .	-2.2014
Elections can only be truly representative and credible if women participate fully and are involved in all parts of the electoral process .	-2.2465
Afghanistan 's elections to the provincial Council and presidential elections will take place on 5 April .	-2.6676
The Taliban have issued threats to an electoral process that coincides with the transition from international disputes to a consultative role .	-4.4207

Haysom said that a strong role for women will strengthen Afghanistan ’ s democratic success .	-2.5859
The Afghan independent electoral commission reports that 1.2 million women are registered by a total of 3.6 million voters .	-2.0823

Men try to steal 13-year-old girls .	-2.2327
Two young men aged 19 and 23 should have tried on Thursday to rob a 13-year-old girl .	-3.2250
According to police information , the men spoke to the 13-year-old , who sat with friends at the Kolpingstra<unk>e , at 2.55 p.m. , because they wanted to make calls with the girl 's mobile .	-7.0294
The 13-year-old refused the request and continued with her friends .	-3.4385
He then tried to use the cell phone and the girl 's necklace , but that was unfortunate .	-7.3994
Without prey , the duo fled .	-1.9503
The two young men were later arrested by the police .	-1.6666
The investigation is under way .	-1.5492
GM 's concern about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow	-2.5154
A trade union would like to check with managers of the Biscuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at its plant in Glasgow .	-4.8673
GMB Scotland said that the company had contracted over the future of investments at the Tolcross-site .	-5.2230
More than 500 employees work in the plant , producing Hobnobody and Rich Tea biscuits , among other products .	-5.5862
McVities owner , Pladis , said he has invested more than <unk> 5 million in recent years .	-3.1481
He added that workers and trade union representatives would be ' experienced first ' if their activities were to change .	-3.3693
In a letter to the subsidiary director of the company , GMB Scotland McVitie 's request that ' Concern be raised that funding for the modernization of production lines should not be continued ' .	-6.2141
GMB-Senior Organizer Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Suite Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tolcross affects our members deeply .	-4.7957
Generations of families have worked here , and the workforce are concentrating heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area of high unemployment and social deprivation .	-4.0665
Therefore , under the perspective of jobs , wages and prosperity , and against the background of Brexit , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a prosperous McVitie production presence .	-5.4733
A speaker from Pladis said : " The Filialleiter at Tolcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will react directly to it as we value the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-5.4256
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tolcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-3.1414
We discussed with employees that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and uncertain economic climate , are constantly reviewing our business - and this applies to all our business units and sites - in order to remain competitive .	-5.4742
She added : " In recent years , we have invested more than <unk> 5 million in our Tolcross site , in particular in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.5859
We fully recognise the heritage of Tolcross as a production site , and if our operations at the site change , employees and trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-5.5776
Three years ago , did the PSE Group warn Nemar ?	-4.9632
The La League page may express its interest in Marco Verratti .	-3.2335
Paris Saint-Germain will not cease following Nemar after submitting an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his release clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago of the fall of the world ?	-5.2057
The sensational approach spurred the summer transfer window , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for <unk> 89 million .	-4.5780
After finishing , Nemar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest-paid professional athlete .	-5.1207
Barcelona is angry at the way Nemar forced his way out , even though a source near the Catalan board of directors insists that the club has always done its best to take care of him since his arrival in Santos in 2013 .	-4.9494
But was the football world warned about this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?	-3.2065
When Manchester City in 2014 showed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-4.8825
" I am not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be opposing them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-4.6372
" We respect all clubs .	-0.7547
But if they try to sign one of our players , it will have consequences . '	-3.9858
Barcelona seems to have gone beyond this line , with the Spanish association expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-4.3570
The PSG made it clear that they would not allow International from Italy to depart under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its Nemar prizes .	-4.9817

Interview : ' Domspatzen report relieves Pope Georg Ratzinger '	-2.3346
The Rainsburgs Domspatzen report on abuses relieves Pope Georg Ratzinger .	-4.0011
This is the author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-2.1920
The final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral continues to hold discussions .	-4.1331
Christian Weisender , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German press agency , he expects from the former Regensburg Bishop and today 's Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the cathedral master Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emergent Pope Benedict XVI , an apology .	-6.2038
It would greatly serve the image of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger were to express their deep regret at their own omissions or at the time of their misinterpretation of the events .	-5.1839
However , the Vatican Government ' Osservatore Romano ' criticised the fact that in reporting of violence , double standards were applied to the Cathedral beds .	-9.5972
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , no one doubts that it is a case of " shameful and shameful acts " that should be punished and prevented in the future ; but the most striking thing is the " degree of media manipulation " , such as the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the national bioethics committee .	-7.4844
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to keep it as normal , " writes Scaraffia .	-4.6626
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also mentioned in the interview with the Bavarian Radio : " You like to go to the church and this is a accomplishing kiss " .	-7.1556
She also pointed out that , in her youth , ' shots were a very normal educational means ' to be ready with naughty children , as I was one . '	-6.3480
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , because the world has changed .	-3.0247
In the context of reports of abuse , papal brother Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-5.0642
Quite wrongly , the author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote with Ratzinger the book " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) .	-4.4957
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he evaluates the results of the final report .	-4.0229
What exactly is the 440-page report by the lawyer , Ulrich Weber , who was commissioned by Bishop Regensburg to investigate ?	-5.1542
A total of 547 Regensburg Domspatz were " victims of attacks " between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990 's with high plausibility , and 67 domspatzen were sexually abused .	-7.0339
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who was active in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " To sum up , it is important to note that in many cases , a physical form and mental violence was used by Domkapellmeister R.	-7.9280
Especially with high emotionality , the punishment could be more severe for the students .	-4.2525
Yet , unlike many other accused , many victims have estimated the general humanity of R. R. and , therefore , in many cases , even combining positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-7.5329
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburg Cathedral continues to relieve Georg Ratzinger of his opinion .	-5.4135
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence in defence traffic at the Regensburg Cathedral gangs ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-6.0518
First of all , many students highlight their " humanity " .	-3.6986
On the other hand , he also appears to be a cholera and perfectionist , who has become more and more skilled when a domspz did not bring top performance musically .	-8.2884
How do you consider this final report as his biographer ?	-3.3729
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is there .	-6.3588
He is dedicated to eight pages and is clearly free of any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-4.8990
The pre-school violence excesses also took place outside its orbit .	-4.1763
He may be accused of being too late or of not taking the first suspicions seriously enough .	-5.3488
The Domspatz school on which he worked was perceived by virtually all respondents as ' redemption ' , ' sky ' and ' better world ' .	-5.9665
For example , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger also presents an excellent testimony , describing him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " comprehensible " , as extremely good teachers who regularly provided the guys with cakes , biscuits and candies and " always carried out by children " .	-6.7779
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which has led to outbreaks .	-5.2750
He admitted , deeply regrets and apologized for himself many years ago , that he had not only sat with chairs and threw the keyring on the floor , but also pulled out of the ear-packed and excessively naughty guys at the hair or ears .	-9.8265
However , it must be said that in the time in question , the 1960 's and 1970 's , such educational methods were widespread , with parents and teachers alike .	-6.0742
Do you also know these breeding methods ?	-3.1788
Of course , I think of all of us who was born before 1968 .	-2.5895
I have also seen this in a secular school , a state high school .	-3.5252
However , compared with what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and excessive violence at pre-school , that is small .	-5.3790
One wonders whether it is not more likely to be famous and its role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media have just fallen on him .	-6.5337
After all , many of the people who have never understood him are still working diligently .	-4.3578
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-2.6736
In the media , a great deal has been said about the issue of abuse in the Regensburg Cathedral .	-6.6212
Will Georg Ratzinger also be accused of any involvement or involvement in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.8046
Michael Hesemann : Absolutely no .	-3.4157
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the Cathedral Master .	-4.3058
Not even the parents were consecrated .	-1.5550
" I have never dared to talk about it with my father or my mother , " said an injured person on behalf of the others , " I was very embarrassed . "	-6.5081
The real problem with education of sexual abuse was , and is , that most victims are silent .	-5.3137
If they did not even entrust themselves to their parents and brothers , they certainly would not be a director of the choir , who would have been a member of the perpetrator in a way professional .	-8.4380
How do the Cathedral Squadron assess Ratzingers ’ role in dealing with abuses ?	-5.3843
Michael Hesemann : As one student put it , " on sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had the facts in good time and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-6.7741
I also think it is absurd ... to think that it is exactly what it has opened up to him ... more urgently or more clearly than to their parents , internals , teachers of trust etc .	-9.1931
That one speaks with him about sex ... - unthinkable . "	-3.3752
The report thus comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that pupils affected it in advance and / or their surroundings were entrusted to it could not be confirmed within the framework of the investigation ' ' .	-9.9160
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free of any complicity .	-3.6672
He cannot be accused of not obstructing or of being prosecuted .	-5.8094
Therefore , there is no reason to link his good name to these vile crimes , as has unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.8452
In the media , much has been read of " excessive violence " among the Regensburg Cathedral gangs .	-4.9692
Georg Ratzinger , the former mayor of the Cathedral , has been accused of " Visions " in his report .	-6.5055
Does he have to live with this reproach ?	-2.4712
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that the coverage mixes everything and transforms into a huge melange of sexual abuse and excessive violence and somewhere , in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-5.5883
This is , however , an abuse of the report .	-3.7981
The fact is that there is a clean distinction between the pre-school and the secondary school of Domspatten , between sexual abuse and excessive violence , and , let us say , other charges .	-7.0300
In addition , the report deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , which is also for four decades , where Georg Ratzinger was not a director of Domspatten .	-6.5527
The whole horrific caning education , the cases in which gays were literally harassed and maligned by sadistic teachers and suffered horribly , occurred at the primary school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions were needed .	-8.3461
But with those , Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do , for he only got the boys to face when they were already on the Domspattgymnasium .	-5.6502
On that , as most of the witnesses emphasize , was the theme of " pre-school " taboo .	-4.3736
One was only happy to have escaped and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " states .	-3.5177
What was different in the Domspattgymnasium ?	-4.3954
Michael Hesemann : Although there was discipline , there was no sadistic violence .	-4.0185
And that also applies to Georg Ratzinger , in which the report concludes that ' many victims estimated the general humanity of R. and therefore , in many cases , even combining positive memories with him despite violence ' .	-6.0061
So , at most , there remains the charge of turning a blind eye .	-5.1403
However , despite all the efforts , the report could define only two periods of time in which it was reported about the pre-school conditions .	-4.9928
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and the operations at a school where he was not working and responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again at 1993 .	-6.9151
Did Georg Ratzinger keep his ears in front of the stands ?	-3.2130
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Domsputgymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-4.3181
He said to him that ' the caning practice continues in the School of Pre-School ' .	-7.5602
Due to the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.3055
This was , of course , at a time when legal clarity arose when beatings were banned in Bavaria , too .	-4.2674
Before that , they were in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-3.4604
It was also difficult to assess where those affected were perhaps exaggerated or dramatised and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded .	-5.4728
But it cannot be said that it has always looked away .	-4.1818
That is simply not true .	-1.3091
It was only in 1980 that the caning penalty in schools was officially abolished in Bavaria .	-3.3194
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today 's educational standards to that time .	-4.1475
How do you see that ?	-1.5586
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " ephemerism , " the danger of judging past moral standards today .	-5.1374
The Prince is right about that .	-3.2924
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was abominable at all times , nor to what has been written in the pre-school of adversaries and violence against innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond what was then normal .	-7.0377
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked up .	-4.6891
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-3.0412
His means of discipline and punishment , that is to say slap in the ear and draw on the hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-4.6914
When physical punishment was banned , he also strictly adhered to it .	-3.7966
What picture of his regensburg period did Georg Ratzinger present in talks with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-3.8224
Is this a subject of caning ?	-3.9825
Michael Hesemann : Now , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , then Pope Benedict XVI , told from his perspective , since the Cathedral nects played only a minor role .	-6.0773
However , I do not hide the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.1892
But that , too , must be said : without this perfectionism , without the imperative discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to form an institution of world renown out of the until then nationally renowned Regensburger Domspatz , true cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the USA ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-8.8065
With cookies and candies alone , you won ’ t be a great singer and your success , regardless of the area , but always subject to discipline , passion and self-overcoming .	-9.0853
As what kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-3.5405
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg Ratzinger really very well and experienced again and again as a wonderful , humorous , base-quality , deeply believing and heart-good people , from whom one cannot imagine that he could do something to an fly .	-8.9452
I regularly get to know how many former Domspatzen still today , 23 years after his awakening , keep in touch with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-6.2820
So those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-3.8169
Today most Domspatten are grateful to him for enriching their lives and bringing them closer to the world of music .	-5.5739
And that he has always been a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a love-worthy worthy person of respect , to whom they are still hanging up today and who truly honour them .	-9.5718
I would ask you once again to make it quite clear that all that is being accused of is education methods which were then on the agenda .	-6.6805
We can be glad that we have overcome this time long ago .	-3.6270
But it is extremely unfair to make a man scapegoats just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother .	-3.9823
The evil intention behind this is all too obvious .	-3.3637
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-3.0404
Now it would be the decency to have a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and who , without being familiar with the Regensburg Cathedral , and perhaps even Germany , would finally be able to get to peace .	-10.7921
