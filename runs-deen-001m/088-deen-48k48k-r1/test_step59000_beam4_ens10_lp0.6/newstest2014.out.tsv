Good : More pedestrian safety	-2.1872
They are not 100 metres from each other : on Tuesday the new B 33-year-old gazebos was put into operation at the village parking lot - in sight of the older Rathausflel .	-8.4334
Two installations so close to each other : Intention or Shield citizens ?	-5.3919
This question was clearly answered by Gutbach ’ s Mayor yesterday .	-3.9879
" The Town Hall Hall lamp was installed at that time because it secured the school way " , explained yesterday .	-6.0339
The Kluser traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus users and mountain residents .	-3.6394
The plant officially opened in operation yesterday is important for the intersecting area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-4.1091
We have a museum , two churches , a park , a bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as a traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-6.0622
" In the high volume of traffic and pedestrian traffic , the safety of which was another traffic lights , " says Eckert .	-7.5318
This also confirms Peter Arnold of the Land Council of Offenburg .	-3.4198
" According to current measurements , approximately 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach every day , of which about 10 % is heavy traffic " , Arnold stresses .	-5.7671
Therefore , building another set of traffic lights is more than necessary : " Safety is just about here " , says Arnold .	-5.7744
In total , four traffic shows were carried out , a round about which was thought to be arranged , but because of the close in the Kreuzungsarea Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e was discarded .	-8.5960
According to Arnold , everything was tested at the location of the traffic light masts : " By means of an extra transport that is particularly long loaded for us , we tested whether these vehicles from the Sulzbachweg can be transferred to the B 33 without needing to pass the traffic lights " .	-10.1351
The € 15 000 tax amp system itself is the " most modern on the market " , the Arnold explained .	-5.5357
The complex is equipped with coloured LEDs that shine so strong that the lights are well visible from the motorists , for example in deep sun .	-6.8129
And it is also economical : the older light systems use about 100 watts , the new one just eight watts .	-4.2153
There are three light installations per drive .	-2.7076
Arnold explained the technology of the new plant : It is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.6065
The upper radar sensor tests the traffic condition .	-4.2102
If the road is free , green comes immediately for the pedestrians , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.8024
A further radar sensor checks whether the green phase can be closed for the pedestrians .	-3.9522
" If a group or handicapped people go over the road , the green phase is prolonged , so everyone is safely going over the road , " said Arnold .	-5.4263
Of course , drivers have to think as partners and watch the track .	-5.8666
This was not the case yesterday : little showed the traffic light for green pedestrians , blowing a class vehicle - with bright red .	-5.6021
For more than 30 years , Josef Winkler has been writing the needs of his childhood and adolescence .	-4.0810
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village childreness - the speechlessness , the peness to brute force and the silent sexuality , the closeness and the deafness of his life .	-8.1773
The Academy Award winner is known primarily as Prosacer , and theatre texts are in his rarity work .	-6.4816
Collage from Prosatextend Gerhard Fresacher brings together a collage of Prosatextend for his performance " Weather lights on the tip " which is now visible in garage X at Peterplatz .	-7.2295
The theatermaker combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibown " ( 1987 ) with prossaminisation from " hearkenal , his family charged " ( 2003 ) .	-8.7870
On the stage , which is largely leaned , important retour : a crushed sofa , which is sometimes copied and spliced - the eight-man ensemble is hanged by text material .	-10.2651
At the same time , director Freacher seems to have little faith in the text .	-3.4793
The 70-minute performance overstates the presentation with a wealth of registration cases , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms .	-6.4807
The actors , in particular , carry out the sometimes rather questionable conversion .	-6.6356
They are crisscrossed with their heads under water , washed with their nightmares on the wall .	-6.5117
They are hung in Cellophan or Mieder , standing on dangerously high poles through the staging , either monologize them loudly or are completely silenced on the stage floor .	-9.5068
The text , however , is hardly mediated in this manner .	-4.3562
The best moments have happened in the evening when sung - the range ranges from Deep Purple to popular tunes .	-5.8893
Only by the end , the overshot performance comes a little to rest , and Winklers retrospectively trump an absurd sense of humour .	-9.0560
A blackbox in your car ?	-1.4633
American street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling Highwayy system , and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that can be placed on the dashboard of each car .	-6.4046
The equipment that record every kilometre and report information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to review the obsolete system for financing American roads .	-5.0730
The normally boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-3.4123
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the driven kilometers – and possibly also where they have been driven – and then use the information for calculating tax modest .	-6.2175
The Tea Party is appalling .	-1.7301
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns .	-2.4946
But , while congressional leaders cannot agree on action , several states are no longer waiting .	-6.6992
They are currently examining how they can move over the next ten years to a system whereby drivers pay per driven mile .	-4.2013
Thousands of motorcyclists have already tested the tachograph , some of which are equipped with GPS surveillance .	-5.6113
This is really a must for our country .	-1.3680
“ It ’ s nothing that we will use only , ” said Hasan Ikhhrata , CEO of Southern California Assn of Governments , who plans to record the driven miles at all Californian drivers from 2025 .	-5.5438
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.3022
The technology for that is there .	-3.9743
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from taxes paid by US Americans at the barrel of fuel , is broke .	-4.4480
But America is no longer doing as much as it did before .	-3.7010
Cars use less fuel .	-1.7066
The state mineral oil tax of 18.4 cent per gallone ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.5727
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax at high fuel prices by just one cent .	-3.7058
“ The gasoline tax is simply not viable , ” says Lee Munnic , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-2.9556
His federal state has recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a meel-based payment system .	-4.6088
“ This is the most sensible option in the long term , ” he said .	-2.3665
Bureaucrats call it a miles based user charge .	-2.8870
It is not surprising that the idea of urban liberals is popular , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced .	-4.5436
California planners are relying on the system to develop strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious , legally binding targets for climate change .	-4.7550
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also explained that he sees the most viable long-term alternative .	-4.3410
The Reson Foundation ’ s free marketers are also inspired by the idea of letting drivers pay after the distance they have been .	-6.5331
“ This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole , ” Adrian Moore explains Vice-President for directives on Reson .	-2.9562
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.3849
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers , who , in a report in 2011 , had called on Congress to move toward mealin-based settlement .	-5.1050
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million expensive pilot project , which would have covered 10,000 cars .	-2.9364
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of rural MEPs who often have to leave many miles on their way to work or to the city .	-6.0426
Several states and major cities , however , are moving in this direction on their own .	-4.3548
Oregon is one of the most committed in promoting 5,000 drivers to the country ’ s largest experiment .	-6.7362
These drivers will soon pay the mileage charges instead of the mineral oil tax to the state .	-5.4633
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.7417
New York City is also considering this .	-1.8476
Illinois is testing it to a limited extent with truck vehicles .	-3.9015
And the I-95 coalition , which includes 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently exploring how to introduce the change .	-3.8063
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.8921
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-4.2530
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” says Alauddin Khan , director of strategic and earnings management in the Department of Commerce of Nevada .	-5.4922
People did not want it .	-1.2919
When the test ran , the Nevada ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into adult surveillance equipment . ”	-4.8568
There is no need to build a gigantic , unwieldy technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data about the daily movements of individuals .	-2.6779
Nevada is a series of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the driven kilometers , but not exactly when and where .	-4.4131
By that , Khan , the public would also be more peaceful .	-3.8638
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small start-up company called True Mileage in California .	-1.8704
The company was not originally started to help states tax drivers .	-4.8859
Rather , it was their goal to take root in an emerging market for car insurance , in which drivers should pay on the basis of the limited miles .	-5.8836
But the devices they are tested are also interesting for street planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information regularly uploaded via modem .	-5.1114
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-3.4366
Some of these public pilot programmes have made major mistakes .	-2.6365
There are far cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-2.6391
In Oregon , planners are experimenting with giving motorists a range of choices .	-3.8769
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.8544
Or they do not choose a device at all and instead pay a flat-rate fee based on the average number of miles driven by all the inhabitants of the state .	-5.0927
Other bodies hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than with more tools .	-4.6860
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a taxation device that also pays parking fees , insurance for driven miles , and speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion .	-6.6937
“ Car drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits that the system offers , ” says it in a planning document of the city .	-4.3161
However , some road planners wonder whether all the talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-3.7598
In the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area , officials said that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising the fuel tax .	-4.0041
An additional one-time fee or an annual levy could be imposed on motorists using hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little petrol , so that they too pay a fair share .	-4.6258
“ There is no reason for an operation if an Aspirin is enough , ” says Randy Renterster , the head of Commission legislation and public affairs .	-5.3638
If we do that , hundreds of millions of road users are taking care of their privacy and many other things .	-4.3863
Königsfeld : Small team beats Wacker	-3.4896
The volunteers of the fire brigade managed their autumn chief test , despite lack of personnel with bravour .	-6.4019
Only eleven men took part in the exercise .	-1.8963
Hans Kammerer had chosen the property spring in Burgberger Street in his training sessions .	-4.3323
The sawing should have a short circuit .	-6.1998
Two people were injured by the resulting fire and smoke development , but one of them could still send an emergency call .	-4.0118
After the first review of the situation by Hans Kammerer , two soldiers were prepared to enter the building .	-4.7628
After a short time , we managed to find the first person and go to the free .	-4.5521
The second person had to be borne .	-2.0319
This was not so easy , as there was also a narrow staircase .	-7.3263
The building , a workshop with integrated stables for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.4253
There was plenty of wood and also straw ballots in it .	-4.5001
There were also electrical woodworking machines .	-2.8174
The first extinguishing damage was done via the tank in the vehicle .	-3.4320
The city is also home to the University of Chicago .	-9.9873
Three deletions could now be organised .	-3.6125
A hollow tube was used in the building as well .	-4.7038
Hans Kammerer was also involved in the exercise to show what is to be done with little staff available .	-6.8274
In the worst case , support is given to the Königsfeld daily operational group .	-4.5578
The commander was satisfied with the process of the exercise . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.8800
Interlinking universities and companies Important	-2.8134
During his visit to the Breisgau High Black Forest , the President of the country , Guido Wolf , was able to find out where the workforce of tomorrow came from .	-8.7163
In the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum , he addressed this important issue together with the leading school directors of the professional schools , as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the chairman of the parents ' associations .	-7.5836
" Education is an important location factor " , stressed Claudia Stahlle , director of the Hans-Thoma school , who presented the InterNette Schulproject Bildungszentrum Hochschwarzwald .	-5.3873
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education .	-2.3478
Since 2011 there has been a successful cooperation between the Förderstadt , the Kreisgymnasium and the vocational training centre in the city of Rostock .	-7.3726
He also praised the family-friendly character of the district .	-3.3656
" It is important not only to look at the family phase , but also because of demographic change the phase of care for relatives , " said Wolf .	-4.7953
He also assumed that more and more employees were caring for and caring for their family members .	-4.3759
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the employment relationship , " Wolf said .	-3.4046
But no one can afford to lose a skilled workforce , he continued to say .	-2.7565
Another , particularly important factor is the networking of universities and businesses .	-3.4278
" For anyone who has experienced the region ’ s benefits during his studies often remains with his acquired knowledge and skills to the regional economy , which helps to strengthen the region , " the country president was convinced .	-7.9210
Only if adequate training places were offered can skilled workers be covered .	-3.8393
In his opinion , the location advantage of the county is its advantageous location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.0279
In addition , on his journey from Titise-Neustadt to Freiburg , he witnessed the efforts already made to develop local public passenger transport .	-5.6264
" Stay persistent and ensure that public transport becomes better , " he explained to the local politicians present .	-4.8921
Live an entertaining afternoon with music	-2.6204
For 15 years , the Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinter seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a gipsy .	-6.1260
In the past , the elderly were reared in the resting place .	-4.3552
In the meantime , it is taking place this afternoon in the Pflegheim St. Josef .	-5.8142
The locals enjoyed the delicious cakes and cakes .	-1.9299
Later we had salted sausages .	-2.8372

The more than 100 years old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old church farm before the renovation of the church road is to be set again on the reconstruction cost plan of the town of Bränlingen .	-7.7570
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angular wall was built during the first works of the renovation of the front school courtyard to stabilize and static discharge of the over a century old natural stone wall with balustrade .	-6.5895
The next step is to involve Alexander Misok from the Brnlinger Municipal Building Office in the planning and to build a restoration concept for the old wall .	-6.9800
This will be followed by a calculation of costs by experts , which will then be put on the table to the local Council to decide and determine the follow-up .	-7.4733
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-2.8407
After the renovation , paving and planting of the old school courtyard within the two wings of the school , which was built in 1912 , it is necessary to repair and build on new premises in the foreseeable future .	-9.1195
The historic one-hundred-year old chapel wall of the old schoolhouse to the church road is mainly due to water and frost damage , as there is no drainage , needs to be repaired and has an arcane inclination to advance .	-8.9989
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to the damage caused by the weather , but the wall is not currently under threat of collapse .	-5.8569
A sturdy wall is a prerequisite for one of the pupils using school yard , which has been carried out by the current fortifications .	-7.1184
The school hall was originally planned even in the years 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure led to a shift .	-6.0768
One important word in the historic school masonry , which has even been used for film , is the State Historical Office .	-7.0404
If targets come from this site , the city of Bränlingen hopes to receive grants from the protected monuments .	-7.8337
The students of the Bränlinger Primary School , who are now taught in a well restored old school building with a new Aula , can soon use the old school courtyard .	-9.7896
<unk>zdemir ’ s intention is to maintain jazz training in Stuttgart	-3.1608
Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now also been involved in ongoing discussions on the future of music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.3877
" I think it is wrong to give up the holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart " , said <unk>zdemir at the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.9434
Jazz and classical belong together at the Stuttgart Jazz Center .	-4.0744
Thus , <unk>zdemir , who is considered a favorite in Stuttgart for a direct mandate at the federal election on 22 September , is opposed to the Green Red provincial government .	-6.2424
On the basis of an expert study , this is forcing a rearrangement of the five music colleges in Baden-Wuerttemberg .	-4.9529
After that , the course of study jazz and pop is to be relocated from Stuttgart University of Music to Mannheim University of Music .	-5.9220
US border : ' Super-tunnel ' on drug smuggling discovered	-7.8579
On the border between Mexico and the USA , investigators discovered and decommissioned a ' super-tunnel ' on drug smuggling .	-3.6250
As the US customs authorities said , the more than 500 metres long tug between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , train tracks and a ventilation system .	-4.2760
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.4057
According to the information , the tunnel has not yet been used .	-2.9316
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar , " said the Attorney General of the US District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a store in San Diego , where an end of the tunnel had been discovered .	-4.7662
Duffy said to the drug gangs : " If your tunnel continues to build and try to use it , we are determined to make it a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.7181
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in permanent combat against the drug cartels .	-2.4766
Since 2006 , more than 77,000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime .	-2.6958
Organized by Experts	-2.2803
Because of the complex equipment of the tunnel , investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took place around a year .	-4.6183
The railway system was equipped with such equipment that electrified cars could be used there .	-4.3918
On the Mexican side there is access in a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-4.3061
According to the authorities , a ladder leads 20 metres deep to the actual tunnel entrance .	-3.4375
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1,20 meters height and 90 centimeters wide .	-3.0474
It would have been appropriate to encourage illegal immigration towards the US .	-2.8433
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine affair .	-1.8834
The third , a Mexican , was caught because of the confiscated marijuana .	-2.5330
All three are threatened as a maximum sentence of lifeimprisonment , as officials said .	-4.2056
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , the US press conference in San Diego continued .	-4.7162
It is , however , the first time that such a tunnel was found in Kokain .	-3.7529
Normally , cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .	-3.1137
This shows the " desperation " of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the drug launch DEA in San Diego .	-4.6285
They would do everything to get to the US .	-2.4082
No details were disclosed to those arrested , at least one was Mexicans .	-4.1439
They have to face prison sentences of up to ten years .	-2.6121
2014 ’ s Cordier Year	-4.3037
The jubilee of the city of violsinging on the occasion of the 1250 .	-3.3712
The return to the first original mention is coming ever closer .	-4.2229
The anniversary year is coming to an end in just eight weeks .	-3.4824
Horny and church houses were mentioned for the first time at 794 .	-5.7491
A certificate was built in churches in which both towns were mentioned .	-3.8852
On the 15th of March there will be an official prelude to the anniversary year , and since Geising does not have a hall at the moment , this event will take place in the place , where the two were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-8.0112
During the jubilee several events are planned both in violsinging and in church houses . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.9363
In July , the 1250 church houses were built on a festival weekend between 18 and 20 July .	-5.5703
This is to celebrate .	-3.5487
On Friday with a feast , on Saturday and Sunday with a feast around the church hall .	-3.3561
On this weekend , the church church church church is also held .	-6.2022
Rudolf Barth Town Music Director wrote a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which will be performed at three events .	-6.4311
On June 21 , together with the celebration of the Black Forest Association on Sunday , on July 12 at the Arena with fireworks and on December 13 the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-5.3036
This will be completed and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official date is on the last weekend of September , 27 and 28 September .	-5.2313
On the occasion of the celebration of the city , a new chronicle is also published .	-4.6547
" It is to become a chronicle not only by violins themselves , but rather a printed work on the violins of today , which is made of violins , church houses , Leipzig , Aulfingen and Gutmadingen " , says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-7.7302
And the violinist of today ’ s 2014 birthday was also celebrated . In 1974 , today ’ s space was completed with the opinions .	-7.1992
The new chronicle will be presented at the new Festhalle in Geising on November 21 or 22 .	-4.0549
2014 , too , is another year with many anniversaries .	-5.9849
The Narrenft Strohglonki begins on February 8 with a traditional evening on its 60-year anniversary , the harmony of Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will be held on March 29 at the Festbankett and will celebrate the district music festival from May 1st to 4th .	-8.4805
The Altenwerk Leipzig is 40 years old , the Geiligen School has been at the new location for 50 years and is celebrating this on May 10 , the music association Polyhymnia Leipzig will be 150 years old and will celebrate it within the framework of the Brunnefest of 4 to 7 July .	-7.3189
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a gift certificate held by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764 .	-7.1127
The certificate was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then court place .	-4.1596
So both communities are mentioned in the same document .	-2.0176
In addition , municipal reform is still 40 years behind in 2014 to celebrate the same period of the .	-6.6676
The Council ’ s Invoking Gle	-6.5347
Should the " Am Hirschen " train pass be extensively rebuilt to increase road safety ?	-4.1575
Yes , the local councils have decided .	-1.9197
Schiltach has to pay EUR 220 000 for this .	-3.9568
Deutsche Bahn is planning to improve the Kinzigal route next year .	-6.0378
The aim is to increase safety at rail crossings - regularly it is the cross-border occurrence of collisions of trains with other vehicles .	-8.6462
If the municipalities agree to reform , they must take part in the cost by one third , the rest are rail and federal .	-6.5067
The local councillor Roland Griesakter explained to the council the peculiarities of the " Am Hirschen " Bahang .	-9.2605
There , the city plans to build an excursion to the west of the railway track in the height of the tunnel there .	-6.2985
There , even larger vehicles , such as those that carry timber , could stand for counter traffic without having to block the track .	-8.9254
Greek partners therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could then expand its subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-6.1749
This was controversial in the municipal council , as some councils questioned the need for the mass of roads : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , raised the mood of critics : ' Do we have to take so much money out of hand because of so few vehicles ? '	-8.3196
Mayor Thomas Haas said : The " Hirschen " train pass is regularly used for timber transports .	-5.3732
Even wood from the area " Kuhlbach " is transported in part through this route because the vehicles up to 20 meters long cannot use the route on the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road there .	-6.7094
In addition , the route serves as a route for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-4.4008
The railway pass " Am " Hirschen " can also provide an important means of transport for a longer period .	-6.9728
The Councils agreed to have an inquiry into the costs of the envisaged extension of the road .	-5.2999
Despite this , the majority of the members agreed to restructure the rail transit system with the assumption that the necessary support wall was built in such a way that the city could then expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " if necessary for network traffic to around 5.5 metres .	-11.1544
On the other hand , the reconstruction of the rail passage at Gerfra Tratweein could lead to a very different problem affecting the passage into the " Geroltzhäuser Weg " , which is growing up .	-10.0704
The administration had been able to investigate the train 's reconstructions plans by the engineer Breinlinger , since it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg was possible without further ado .	-8.8922
The study concluded that it was not possible to rule out the street ’ s tilt conditions that would result in longer vehicles being stuck .	-6.8023
The responsibility for this lies with the city as a road construction worker .	-5.0722
The restructuring could therefore entail liability disputes .	-3.1697
Haas argued , because both wood and bending worked in the current state of development , if one did not agree to the reconstruction of the rail transit .	-8.1113
Even at this point , the risk of a collision of the turn with a vehicle on the pass is significantly lower than on the other train passes , because it is right next to the center stop , to which a good visibility link exists .	-8.5887
Even trains from the main station would have to be warned that there was no collision .	-6.0321
The city of Schiltach had to " swim " the problem of reclining vehicles , so the councils were to be withdrawn from responsibility after the construction works had been completed .	-9.9189
As an unproblematic matter , the body considers the reconstruction of the railway passages " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhlbach " , for which already cross agreements with the railway were concluded .	-8.2186
Esa decides on large-scale space missions : Billions of missions	-6.4880
distant planets , gravitational waves , or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects they want to start in the next few years .	-4.6439
30 suggestions were available , five are still in the race .	-2.5209
Far worlds .	-0.6456
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-3.0916
No one knows whether there are at least some of them .	-3.1658
The choice is hard : to search for gravitational waves ?	-3.4493
Or rather explore the origins of cosmos ?	-2.4232
Or the earth like planet fahnden and thus perhaps discover extra-terrestrial life ?	-7.7321
These are the questions that are specifically raised by the managers of the European Space Agency Esa .	-4.7621
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects , which are intended to make research progress .	-5.9076
The budget for these ' L-missions ' is approximately EUR 1 billion each .	-3.3831
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 . , , , , etc , , or . , , , , , , , , ,	-5.8228
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-1.9816
30 ideas were on the table , five of which have now come to the fore .	-5.0185
Many bodies examine the proposals and submit recommendations to the researchers .	-4.4451
In the next few days a final decision shall be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-3.7812
In total , four major questions have been selected by the Esa , on which the missions of the 2007 program " Cosmic Vision " will find answers .	-4.7157
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and life ?	-1.4575
The exact occurrence of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets around these stars - is still in the proverbial dark .	-4.8698
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this dark .	-2.1368
And if a star planet has , under what circumstances can life arise there ?	-3.2860
To investigate this issue , the Space Telescope is due to start " Cheops " in 2017 , with the 500 already known planetary systems in our surroundings being studied more closely .	-6.8197
But the possibilities are limited , while Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.0683
With larger instruments , astronomers could map similar planets , and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , thus searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered to be an indicator of biological activity .	-5.3757
How does the solar system work ?	-1.1208
This question is also meant to provide an indication of the conditions for the emergence of life .	-5.7767
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role and the interaction of its magnetic field as well as the particle radiation that it produces with the planetary system .	-4.8861
In our solar system these processes can be investigated in an exemplary manner .	-3.7974
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already approved a M-Class mission ( there is the budget of about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.4354
The probe is expected to start in 2017 and watch the sun ’ s surface and activity closely .	-4.8780
For researchers , Jupiter and his moons are also of great interest .	-3.6920
You want to find out what role the giant planet played in the development of the solar system .	-3.3383
For this , the Esa is the first of three L-missions of the " Cosmic Vision " program .	-4.0332
The sonde " juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-4.1734
Eight years later , it reaches Jupiter and is intended to study the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moons Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-4.9533
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.8887
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature that we know are still valid there .	-5.9048
It may also be possible to find deviations that could lead physics to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be combined .	-6.3185
How did the universe arise and what is it made up ?	-3.8385
Our cosmos was created by the big bang , 13.7 billion years ago .	-3.9752
In addition to the familiar subject , which consists of stars , planets , and creatures such as us , Dark Matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and Dark Energy , whose actions speed up the expansion of the universe .	-7.2504
Until now , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang , nor the worst matter and Dark Energy .	-5.7092
With Euclid , the Esa has already approved an M mission to be launched for 2020 .	-3.6975
With a special telescope , the probes will investigate the distribution of matter in the universe throughout the sky for the first time , allowing conclusions on the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy .	-5.1467
Who could Make the Race	-2.8762
Of the 30 proposals , only two will be left over at the end of the selection process .	-2.1576
In the opinion of many experts " E-Lisa " , the best chance for an L mission is to prove gravitational waves .	-5.2657
These include physicists changing the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-3.8929
They have not been shown to this day .	-3.3325
Elisa could do that , hope the scientists behind the project .	-2.8682
The mission provides one of two or three probes with the existing detector deployed in space .	-5.0954
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also demonstrate gravitational waves that emerged during the Big Bang , providing new insights into the origins of the cosmos .	-6.8524
Four further proposals compete for the second L-Mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure cosmic background radiation , and the " exoplanet Finder " , which is to detect and study similar planets .	-6.3485
We already have suggestions for the return of samples from Mars , for the exploration of the moon , Venus and asteroids , and for sunphysics .	-5.9750
Snowden ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-2.2105
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US secret service , has said that he is ready to travel to Berlin and to say before the German Bundestag , when the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not provide answers to their activities .	-6.2598
The German MEP , Hans-Christian Ströbele , met Snowden in Russia on Thursday , where he received asylum to discuss what he said in Germany .	-4.2211
In a letter from Snowden , presented on Friday by Ströbele to the media in Berlin , he writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts has been proven positive , my government continues to treat a different view as a fiduciary and tries to criminalise political expression with a threat of penalty , in which no defence is possible . ”	-7.8867
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-2.8099
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support can convince the US government to drop the charge against him .	-4.5176
The charge raised by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state assets .	-3.3081
The German Minister of the Interior , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said online about time : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to talk to German representatives , then we will find ways to make that possible . ”	-5.1699
US-Germany relations are strained by the claims that the NSA has shut down Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.3643
Thomas Oppermann , the Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that one should take the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , “ without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-6.4972
Strbele , a Green MEP , published an image of himself and Snowden in his Twitter community .	-3.6778
He was accompanied by two German journalists when he visited Russia .	-1.3407
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA-employee Snowden , he could not return to Russia if he left the country .	-4.4689
If Snowden is touring Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , so the honourable Member will .	-5.2610
Snowden explained in his letter that he would face a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that drove him out of his home country .	-3.5928
But he is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-3.3366
Citizens around the world , as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations about an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a collective gain .	-5.0087
In his letter , Snowden gives the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.9777
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-3.8857
Frontier Airlines plans to charge up to $ 100 of passengers who wish to fly their hand baggage .	-4.7874
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even if the announcement on Wednesday was read that passengers should keep the full dose .	-4.1403
The new fee applies to cabin baggage in a baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat remain free .	-3.9943
Frontier explained that it is calculated $ 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and $ 100 for travellers who only paid on the boarding gate .	-5.0736
Frontier spokeswoman Kate O 'Malley said that the charge of $ 100 aims to persuade travelers to take care of the payment in advance .	-5.7809
“ We don ’ t want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.3267
Airlines started charging the first and second piece of luggage in 2008 .	-2.8545
As a result , passengers who tried to avoid them have plugged as much as possible into their hand baggage , which means that they are often overcrowded over the seat .	-7.3369
Charges are one way to persuade passengers to take less on board .	-2.8492
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about making money .	-2.3715
It is about the most loyal clients of Frontier who have clearly stated that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space in the compartment above the seat .	-6.3508
Passengers who purchase your tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-6.9662
This means that a passenger may carry one piece of baggage free of charge on the sideboard , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-5.0213
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed , so that passengers would be informed of the charge before coming to the gate .	-4.7326
Frontier 's new hand baggage charge will only enter into force in the summer , but there is no exact date yet .	-5.2184
Passengers often complain about baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines are happy to take recourse to them .	-5.1948
You argue that baggage transport costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-3.5753
Many on Wall Street see new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-5.5800
However , most have so far made the finger of charges for hand luggage .	-5.4413
Spirit Airlines Inc . , three years ago , required first hand baggage charges , and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost flyer .	-4.5060
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizard Air , explained by the airline advisor Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-4.5308
In a report of December 2011 , he estimated that the Spirit hand baggage charge would raise USD 50 million annually .	-4.3557
Sorensen , who formerly held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the boarding gate if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual handbaggage charge .	-6.0183
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-3.8412
I expected to see tactical and tangible discussions on the platform .	-3.2040
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and boarding was as sleek as it did . ”	-4.4597
Frontier also follows Spirit at the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , lemonade or juice .	-3.2561
The company explained that passengers who bought limonade or juice should keep all the can and have coffee filled for free .	-4.8316
Water is still free .	-1.5164
In 2008 , US Airways had been trying to make cash for soft drinks , but it retracted seven months later , after complaints of passengers and no other large company had retracted .	-7.6972
Frontier 's step to charge cabin baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-4.6161
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per sold ticket .	-2.9743
This will provide all companies with an incentive to travel passengers for direct purchase , rather than through an online travel agency .	-6.2177
Frontier , however , has gone furthest in this area .	-2.9771
In September , the company began to award only half the number of frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-4.0600
On Wednesday , the miles were once again reduced to 25 percent of the route .	-2.8545
A passenger with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third-party provider therefore only pays 250 miles to customers .	-5.5297
Passengers can also make reservations on the Frontier 's website for direct purchase .	-5.2075
Frontier has a loyal customer base in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-3.9329
The revenues were down by 9 percent and the airline capacity decreased by almost 13 percent in the first quarter , as read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-5.1389
Republic has tried to control Frontier 's finances as part of the sale of society .	-4.1877
sayings made by the Bible	-3.8942
Around 40 women attended the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .	-3.6181
The theme of the day in the Town Hall was ' Biblical sayings ' and ' medieval speeches ' .	-4.5220
After breakfast , Zita Köhler , the chairman of the Council of Churches , gave a lecture on biblical sayings .	-4.4686
'Fairwords include sayings , rules or warnings ' , she explained .	-3.5523
She gave several sayings of the respective biblical texts and explained the meaning .	-4.6411
As you said , wood eels are vigilant as panes fall from the eyes , drawing an eye on someone who gives his own son 's in sleep , washing his hands in innocence .	-9.2468
Several times , the referent also advised the audience what the saying was .	-5.5181
The medieval saying goes back to Christel Dehner : All good things are three , blue , slightly blurred .	-5.2317
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-3.0364

Learning instead of unemployed : pilot project for Unlearned Tourism	-3.2544
A pilot project for the tourism industry was launched at the Mecklenburg Seeplatte .	-4.2121
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unlearned in the sector should be qualified for hotels and restaurants over three winter months .	-5.8571
" New to it is that the six months end courses with degrees , " Carmen Wiechert said by the Arbeitsagentur Neubrandenburg .	-5.5672
The benefits are manifold : the participants would not be unemployed , the companies would receive skilled workers , who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the Agency should not fund unemployment .	-6.7673
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- and Gaststättenverband ( Dewa ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern .	-3.9499
NSA declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the web site crash	-4.6332
The shadowy National Security Agency declared on late Friday that a mistake had caused a few hours of paralysing its public website and not hackers , as was claimed online .	-5.9428
“ NSA.gov was not available for a few hours this night , as an internal error occurred during a scheduled update , ” the spy agency explained in an e-mail message sent .	-5.1281
The problem has been fixed this evening .	-1.9230
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed denial of service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.0508
In the early hours of the evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours and that for some users it is still not .	-5.6177
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the Agency ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.8539
Secret information is not in danger , says the speaker .	-2.6158
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-3.2733
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-3.9026
Cybertactic is relatively simple , and attacks do not serve to penetrate the target system 's internal network .	-2.9731
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname once was No Search Agency ( no such authority ) , now finds itself in the light of the public and , after the revelations of its widespread surveillance program at home and abroad , has been subject to sharp criticism – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disenchanted former NSA-Edward Snowden .	-8.1637
The growing controversy surrounding intelligence fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted Cyperoperation .	-4.4249
The number of people without jobs dropped slightly in October by 22 to 1,307 .	-3.4411
Although the 3.1 % quota was better than last year and even better than in September , " we would have hoped for more " , says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Director of the Labor Agency in Sonthofen .	-5.7203
Because many companies have so far reacted to attitudes .	-3.0642
One reason for this is , according to Felder-Bauer : ' We have hardly any skilled workers in the trades , in health care and in care for the elderly ' .	-5.9912
Since September , due to the year , employment opportunities for staff in the hotel and catering industry are again being established .	-7.4918

Bombardier ’ s earnings after drop in delivery numbers and orders .	-2.8447
On Thursday , Canadian aircraft and rail manufacturers Bombardier Inc reported a 15 % reduction in net profit after being put under pressure by declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter , as well as contract problems in rail sectors .	-6.3976
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also did not publish flight test data for its brand new plane of the CSeries , and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule of next September .	-13.1720
On the maiden flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago , only three new starting points were followed , which makes it clear that the test phase is as planned .	-7.6673
The results were lagging behind the forecasts and led to a decline of more than 8 % in the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-4.6180
Cameron Doerksen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his assessment of “ outperform ” on Thursday to “ sector perform ” with a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-4.2824
“ Although weaker deliveries were widely expected on aircraft , we are clearly disappointed with the progress in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-7.0013
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeries when the aircraft test program is proceeding .	-5.1329
If , however , no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more skeptical about the program .	-3.3683
Bombardier hopes that the A380 series can catapulte the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-3.9399
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for months of delay in September for the first time .	-3.0635
But , so far , binding orders for CSeries with 177 are moderate , as potential buyers would like to wait for the results of the flight tests and see if the company 's claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential of the new jet aircraft are applicable .	-6.7567
There are currently 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.5542
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .	-5.2461
The company ’ s management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the programme was in the schedule .	-5.0586
“ The test aircraft did not stay on the ground any longer than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added , while the aircraft ’ s standing time was scheduled for ground tests and software updates .	-6.0046
Each manufacturer is planning differently .	-2.3246
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach a period of revision to what we have also done .	-4.4649
This is done throughout the flight programme .	-3.0829
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the remaining shortly afterwards , it was reported by the company .	-4.9921
However , analysts remain sceptical about whether , twelve months after the maiden flight , the first customer can launch an aeroplane for the CSeries .	-4.8440
Bombardier explained that it will check the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and update it in the coming months .	-4.0109
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even though it appears to be bombing internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will move to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-5.4354
In the third quarter , at the end of September , bombings were net profit to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million or $ 9 cents per share in previous year .	-5.4496
The adjusted profit per share is unchanged at 9 cents .	-2.7756
Sales dropped slightly and dropped from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion .	-2.8199
Analysts expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , so Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.6023
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer admits that he delivered 45 aircraft this quarter , a 57 drop last year .	-3.1818
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.1257
The order book in the aerospace sector was USD 32.9 billion on 30 September and was thus unchanged on 31 December .	-4.2594
“ In the aerospace sector , the results were in our specifications , but the low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.5584
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-2.3316
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this sector increased by barely 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.4897
The order book in the transport sector was 32.6 billion dollars on 30 September and was slightly increased on 31 December .	-4.6059
Profit margins in the transport sector have been affected by resolution problems in some large contracts .	-4.6670
According to corporate management , new targets will be set for the fourth quarter .	-3.3737
In the afternoon trading on Thursday , the Bombardier stock totaled 8.5 % and was $ 4,83 Canadian , after announced that the Google CFO Patrick Pichette will change to the board .	-8.0748

Coca-dependent lawyer who has warned against police investigation of drugs must enter prison .	-4.3220
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information on Lower World Size Neil Scarborough further .	-3.5193
The lawyer was afraid that his domestic drug addiction could come to light .	-3.3809
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpoir Crown Court .	-2.3832
A well-known criminal defender , who warned a drug baron of a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be revealed , was sentenced to three years in prison .	-5.1983
Basharat Ditta , 42 , providing Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its activities in drug trafficking , having been compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-5.7250
Criminalists were the “ top-of-the-line ” attorney with the nickname “ Bash ” in 2011 , after the police had been monitoring Scarborough , whom he had represented in an earlier drug procedure .	-8.8088
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the office of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was a member of a lawyer ’ s dinner .	-5.7281
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed Class A drugs after tests traces of cocaine were found in his hair , in his wallet , and in credit cards .	-4.2550
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain prohibited information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.8905
All four suspects were then monitored by the police within the framework of a major investigation procedure for the heroin and coca trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-4.4542
They were arrested later , together with 32 other people , after a number of house searches , Heroin and cocaine , amounting to <unk> 1.5 million , and <unk> 200,000 in cash .	-11.3936
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals , fearing that his drug dependence could become public .	-4.0088
Today , Ditta , who is working for the law firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted of obstruction of justice after a three-week trial .	-4.8739
He admitted ownership of cocaine in a previous survey .	-3.6346
The attorney was convicted after the police found out in her investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-4.3129
Two investigators followed the suspect and saw how he went to Dittas ’ s house and where he placed the drugs under the dustbin of the lawyer with a purity of 60 % in a black leather shoe .	-6.5252
Shortly after he delivered drugs , Scarborough regularly telephone Ditta , who was at the football stadium of the Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .	-5.1554
The lawyer returned home , took care of the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-2.8738
In court , it was known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after Class A tests had been discovered in his hair , his wallet , and his credit cards .	-5.4759
Ditta was later arrested , but declined to accept cocaine and said he spoke to the presumed dealer because he was his client , claiming that her discussion was inferior to “ legal secrecy . ”	-6.7202
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were assured and a hairtest was taken from him .	-4.7517
In the case of police questioning , he admitted that he operates an office and a client at home on account of legal matters , both at his private address and at the workplace .	-6.3583
In court , it was announced that he had called on important actors in the drug trade , some of which he had previously represented , after significant arrests and informed what investigators knew about them .	-7.2066
Chancellor Anne Whate said , “ A criminal law lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not breaking . ”	-4.1112
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender , being too deeply involved with certain clients .	-4.2080
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.4371
Part of his communication was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer for these people .	-3.8891
But that went far beyond the bounds of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.3976
He looked forward to the police investigation as far as possible so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-4.8650
Mr Ditta made his profession confused .	-4.4451
He was too close to certain clients , particularly Scarborough , and allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.1022
Ditta made every mistake of saying , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass information on to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but do so immediately . ”	-6.6674
But , after the hearing , superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in Lancashire : “ Mr. Ditta took the step from a defense attorney to a criminal at the moment he started to acquire drugs from organized criminals . ”	-5.2678
His cocaine addiction led to a hoped-for compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime who tasked him with obtaining valuable information on police investigations .	-5.5004
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public .	-2.5810
Ditta lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-4.0669
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta , which also resulted in a conviction in three cases on the ownership of cocaine and legal obstacles , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-5.8528
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that no one can escape from the law .	-3.6567
We will find you and bring you to court .	-2.3396
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after having declared guilty of the conspiracy as a heroin , cocaine , and heroin game .	-5.2656
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to total penalties of 153 years for drug offences .	-4.4195
On his website , Ditta published an area with questions and answers about himself in which he angab , his dream job is to represent clients on the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner is Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity is the motivation for his work .	-6.1903
The Revolutionary Work of Church Music	-1.9468
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160-year anniversary , the Lienz Dunningen will frame two religious services with Franz Schubert 's " Deutsche Messe " .	-5.9356
After the great success of the musicals " Rock my Life " , which inspired the audience this spring , the singer will enrich two divine services with the performance of the German Mass by Franz Schubert at the end of the anniversary year .	-6.1018
On Saturday , October 26th , this exceptional fair will be held from 19 at the evening fair in the St. Martinus Church of Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 . October at 10.15 pm at the Mass in St. John Baptist Church in Lachtendorf .	-8.4523
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Gesang zur Feststellung der Messe " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work of composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of its creation .	-7.1251
The exhibition is performed within the framework of the services of the Church , as the principal Johann Philipp Neumann had in .	-5.1698
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the music association Frohsch Tennebronn and Noemi Lobodi on the organ .	-4.2261
Haslach : Uncertainty is	-3.3612
With the elections to the parish council in 2015 , for example , a fundamental change will be made in Haslach ( SE ) , the seain .	-7.4471
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-2.5899
On Saturday , the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischbach , Steinach and Welschsteinach prepared for the changes .	-3.5711
The basic decisions of the Diocese have nothing to do with change and it is up to the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-6.9405
In the course of the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism about new hesitations and a growing sense of confidence . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.7315
From the ideas and expectations of the changes in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the highly constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main community of sea care teams arose .	-6.5564
Regional dekan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the new guidelines for marine care units in the Archdiocese of Freiburg .	-4.9365
Then the SE Haslach , as a parish , will form a body of public law , which will enter the rights and duties of the six separate communities so far .	-6.6752
There will only be a common parish council and a council of foundations in which the priest is represented .	-4.6495
At least two elected members are to be represented from every parish , in which six parishes are called community teams .	-5.4489
Their role will be to promote religious life in the region in the future .	-4.8464
The question of the finances of the individual parish was then subject to considerable discussion .	-5.0793
The news indicates that accumulated credit is required in the parishes .	-6.3451
On the other hand , the liabilities go over to the whole .	-4.2624
There was a great deal of concern , particularly with regard to the large planned investments , the obligation of which then meets all the parishes .	-6.6778
" In the past , too , only investments were made in projects that were managed by the individual parishes alone , " relativized Haslach 's pastor chairman Bruno Princbach .	-7.5357
Practically experience with a common body of five parish churches represented barbar knights , the chairman of the board in the church in Schutterwald-Neuegaten .	-8.3774
You had set yourself the task in 2006 , ' Get one , stay five ' and have seen that this is not so simple .	-7.5595
The bodies of the Haslacher Sea Council subsequently sought to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-5.3722
The revisions will be specified in further meetings and will be adopted in another joint session of all six bodies next spring .	-5.6906
In the end , the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of sea carelessness , which was approved by a clear majority . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.3490
In Pfulendorf , electricity will become more expensive .	-2.6869
The citizens of Pfullenfs must prepare for higher electricity costs .	-3.7772
As the managing director of the Stadtwerke , Jörg-Arne Bias , opposite the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pfulldorfer family will receive between 70 and 90 additional costs per year .	-5.4568
An essential reason for the forthcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEG levy from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.5726
Each year in October , the four operators of the large power routes re-establish this levy .	-6.7930
These are equivalent to the additional costs arising from the energy transition , which can be imposed by means of a levy on the electricity price .	-7.2010
The Stadtwerke Pfulendorf are the last link in this chain .	-3.4495
In his forecasts , the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company even looked at a higher standard , as Jörg-Arne Bias reports .	-5.2430
Now the concrete numbers would have to be calculated before the municipal buildings could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-5.1392
" We are going from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , so Bias , with the number more close to the 2 cents .	-4.7278
Keep an eye on the traffic lights .	-4.4550
Sometimes a traffic light is not green .	-2.7222
The road contact queue does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-6.2452
What should you do then - to drive red ?	-4.5476
If an incident waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-5.0222
But the waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which could be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.6224
Becker advises to hold at least five minutes before assuming that there is a malfunction at the traffic lights .	-4.8945
Anyone who continues the ride despite red light must be aware , however , that he is fully responsible for an accident that caused it .	-5.8527
If you accept less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough , warns Becker and points to a decision by the Supreme Court , Hamm .	-5.5143
In the negotiated case , after about three minutes of continuous red , a driver had ignored the traffic lights and had to answer for a negligent red light injury . were .	-7.3439
After all , the traffic lights were not broken , but jumped into green shortly afterwards .	-5.8320
He was spared a travel ban because of the special situation - but not the fine .	-4.1063
The Municipal Council is pleased about a solid budget	-4.0037
Whenever it comes to the budget in municipal meetings , Mayor Ralph Gerster laughed well .	-4.6751
The local quail in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt no longer knows the administration since 2005 .	-3.8332
The 2012 financial year can also be regarded as a full success in this sense .	-3.2902
This became clear when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .	-2.5642
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget , with around EUR 7.6 million , was more than a million euros than was planned .	-4.7114
The surplus of the administrative budget , with around EUR 1.8 million , is also around EUR 1 million above the approach .	-4.2031
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenue and the local share of income tax .	-4.6980
The wealth budget , too , was well above the planned values .	-4.7880
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged last year , it was EUR 2.5 million .	-2.5455
" This is basically due to the higher allocation from the administrative budget , " said Rothmund .	-4.0144
Since less investment has been made than planned in the financial year 2012 , the recovery plans have also been higher .	-4.6920
Overall , the overall reserve of some EUR 2.1 million has been increased to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-3.4471
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-2.3216
" So a plant is not simply stowed out of the sleeves " , Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts .	-5.5331
He and the local councils were clearly pleased with the good figures .	-3.0201
It may sound like a paradox , but it is precisely these good figures that could soon cost the citizens dearly .	-5.3418
Due to the good financial situation , the municipality has been able to avoid paying high fees in the past .	-6.5061
The result , however , is that , according to Gerster , subsidies have often been cut off by the country .	-5.6659
There are conditions for these grants from various types of compensation .	-3.8184
Among other things , the cities and communities requesting grants must have certain ratings .	-5.0180
" We have to look at the issue of charges , as investments are due in the coming years , for which we would like subsidies , " announced Gerster in this context .	-6.5890
Nagold : Hugo Werden in the Choir for 60 years	-3.3048
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history is nearly twice as long as the Herb Festival , where he was honored .	-6.5494
As usual , Hubert Wertzung was on stage in the colours of his male association .	-5.2095
Even after 60 years , singing with the now more than happy singing chorus still gives him great pleasure .	-7.2892
In the association Werfen was also active , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-4.5650
He received several awards for his commitment and his faithful association : Jörg Kohler , Pastoralreferent , on behalf of the Cäcienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented to him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a letter of honour signed by Bishop Gebhard Fürst .	-5.9650
His singers presented him with the certificate of the German choir association and a engraved tin teller .	-3.8068
In addition to the award , the 31st autumn was well known : The MGV amount , the Liege Salzstetten , the Baisingen Sänger department and the local music association had loaded a mixture of different choirs and vocal styles that kept about 400 visitors .	-8.7854
The MGV full-maringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " Im Weinparadies " and " Lustig , her brothers " .	-3.5361
Hubert Werfen , her honorary son , prepared a small stand for honour - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts " Bundeslied " .	-6.5186

The mixed choir with the Neapolitan folk style " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " of Antoine Gus to foreign countries , while the " Impulschor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their program .	-6.9309
The Sänger department of the Baininger Sports Association came back to the home of " What is the Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts " Beer Carol " , where the Full Marine Music Association offered the final musical finish .	-8.7069
For the children there was a small side programme - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollstemer took up a box theatre and read a few stories about the children in midday .	-7.9431

Kenya ’ s press Worms about controversial media law	-4.2879
“ We are in a frightening situation , and one can ask oneself : what does Parliament expect to simply abolish judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was read in the newspaper , which considers the draft law unconstitutional .	-6.8027
“ The law is draconian and very criminal , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news sites .	-4.3210
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of the government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-3.0121
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft law and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.8398
According to the newspaper The Star , the government is taking “ the media effectively into a stranglehold ” by the new law , written by The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of speech in Kenya , “ suffered a severe blow , ” and claimed to be “ draconian . ”	-6.9888
The adoption of the law is one of a series of measures designed to strengthen national security after the attacks by armed Islamists on the Western gate shopping centre in September .	-5.3031
The Kenyan media drew up the authorities ’ anger because they released safety cameras that saw the units sent to the gate supposedly dismantled the luxury shopping centre .	-8.0933
Police chief David Kimiyo responded with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative , even if the subpoena was withdrawn after a media outcry .	-4.7521
According to the new law , media houses can be punished with a penalty of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings and individual journalists with up to one million , as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from an official press accreditation . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.0343
The tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-3.5312
According to Daily Nation , “ one single penalty can force most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.8756
Moreover , the newspaper considers that these measures could have a devastating effect on what it describes as “ lively blogosphere ” Kenya .	-4.2298
If they silenced the media , politicians could do with impunity , whatever they want .	-3.1115
“ No one will ever know , ” Mutuma Mathiu wrote a journalist at the nation that describes the Kenyan media as a crucial factor of control in public life .	-4.8220
“ Let politicians get themselves together , run the country into bankruptcy , and return to the time of hunters and gatherers , ” he commented .	-5.1934
Kenya ’ s legislators have had public anger in the past .	-2.8302

Bad-Dürrheim : A dream is true for the FC .	-2.3389
The official inauguration ceremony for the artificial turf port despite the cold weather and rain did not diminish the importance of the city and football club .	-6.5874
A more pleasant holiday was probably the last Saturday , but Peter didn 't want to play with it .	-5.8874
For example , all those who came without a umbrella or who could not keep such a thing for any reason .	-6.9453
This went to the musicians , who symbolised the ceremony , as did many speakers .	-6.4951
For this reason Nass also became the FC-chairman Albrecht Schlenker , who talked about fulfilling a dream .	-4.8424

Other key words were for the urban sports committee Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the South Baden Football Association , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the planning office , who announced a donation for the clubs ’ youth department .	-5.8257
Mayor Klumpp reminded us that recurrent weather-related influences in the spring and autumn set the original lawn so that it could not be clogged .	-6.2801
15 years ago , we had the first thoughts on the solution to the problem when we thought of building a third place in the grounds of the football club or at the Real School at the Saline Lake .	-7.2270
Both have been discarded .	-2.6947
Six years ago there were ideas about setting up an artificial turf pitch , which was generally considered the ultimate solution .	-4.6214
Concrete plans were included two years ago , when the FC took over the Shanghai Market Square , pledged a cost share of EUR 100 000 to build the place , and the country approved subsidies of € 104 000 .	-6.1662
The Municipal Council decided in October 2012 to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 at the total cost of EUR 560 000 , and summarised Klumpp .	-3.7834
The starting point of the 68 x 108 m artificial turf course took place on the 4th of June .	-5.1911

There have been traffic on land roads which are already marked by accidents .	-6.6379
Moreover , the introduction of a toll for all cars would be only a first step , from the point of view of Pronolds .	-5.2178

Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the aim of this new innovation .	-3.5096
As Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , the Vienna Airport follows an international trend with the recruitment of reports concerning individuals .	-6.1448
For example , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already missing out on the noisy calls .	-5.5441
As these passes disappear - on average around 200 calls by speakers on a day - in future it will be more quiet at the airport .	-7.5184
" It has also proven in the experience that these individual passes have not been noticed , but at the same time all other information on changes in flight fares or flight times is lost here , " says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-8.9812

Locked pasta instead of egg , for example , with a mixture of a teaspoon of powdered powder , a tablespoon of food and three spoons of mineral water .	-5.2335
But 50 grams of soya yogurt or silk can also fulfil this purpose .	-5.1227
According to the Vebu , around 800 000 people currently eat in Germany , which is purely vegetative .	-6.0822
Sleeping in New York	-2.3388
On the way to their host families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , the students of the Black Forest Grammar taught the American city of New York .	-4.1052
After eight hours of flight , the Brooklyn Bridge was easily reached on foot , which reached the heart of Manhattan on foot .	-5.2867
Here , a fascinating view of the world ’ s famous Skyline , which is a special attraction in the evenings .	-8.3002

Also this year , a Hubertus trade fair will be celebrated in the parish church of St. Marien at the Hülsbergstra<unk>e .	-5.8292

The hunting hornbeam group of the Jagdheider Westphalia , under the direction of Brigitte Kluth , plays on Parforcepörners ( nature horns in the mood Es ) according to old , originally French melodies .	-7.0413

The newly designed Opstrike shines with a new café .	-3.7176
One of the places to relax and unwind .	-5.3903
One that wants to make the name of the programme .	-2.5341
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu refers to a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense of having experienced or seen a new situation .	-6.1994
In the case of the eponymous café at Opstrike in the county town of Kleve , visible to the University of Rhein-Waal , it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-6.0834
After all , the café with its beautiful name has exactly the aim : to make a real stay not only mentally but also to make you experience a lot of time and time again .	-9.4528
Because 's just fun and beautiful .	-2.7039
A glance into the inner life of the opklein 8 immediately gives the viewer a good feeling .	-4.9429
The modern but not cool café ambience looks like a place to feel at home .	-4.2742
Here , the team will be delighted with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top of the hotel , offering a wide range of coffee or cocktail .	-6.9605
There are delicious cakes or freshly baked baguettes each year .	-4.6252
The owners , both 33 years old , have already made a name for themselves before the opening of the cosy opium coffee shop : in Kranburg they introduced the " Art Lounge " .	-6.6862
From moving to Kleve to the Opstrike , the friendly café-lovers are expecting more audiences .	-6.5422
Not least by the university .	-2.9755
" Where we do not have a specific target group , " Daniel Büttner stresses .	-3.0655
Rather , the two young students here would like to address as much as senior citizens and all ages in between .	-5.4743
Speaking of cafe lovers .	-1.6440
The pleasant owner couple stands behind the coffee enjoyment .	-3.0809
Enjoy the scent of hot tea in a variety of variations .	-4.5034
Expressofan	-1.9242
Daniel Büttner is more the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker .	-4.3909
" To do this a baguette - this is my thing , " she tells the NRZ .	-3.5764
Two events already took place in the bright cafe .	-3.2578
Better to say one .	-2.7258
After all , the port festival took place rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-4.2341
But there was also the Ringelnatzal .	-3.9438
" Great , successful and witty " , found the two 33-year-old .	-4.3009
But it is not Jedermann ’ s cause .	-2.9653
Perhaps Daniel Büttner is not a special fan of event evenings either : " You can 't do it all " .	-6.2576
And with an event I always speak only to those who are interested in the special event .	-4.4596
That is why events will be the exception to us .	-2.9709
" We want to disrupt the normal operation as little as possible " .	-4.0224
In other words , Déjà Vu also represents reliability .	-3.2546
With regard to the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at the Opel in Kleve .	-4.2387
The road , which develops more and more into a catering mile .	-4.6466

UN proclaims New Poverty Goals	-2.7573
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals , announced 12 years ago , for combating poverty .	-5.2055
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals that began in 2015 .	-3.9819
They were included in the final draft of the document that will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.9847
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon declared in the evening at the summit that the time had come to think “ beyond national interests . ”	-3.0664
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-4.9350
“ These goals will be built on our Millennium Development Goals progress and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-3.2829
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to realise our vision of the sustainable development goals built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.6393
Even though the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory since four days of play , the Handball Oberligists remain in good mood .	-7.2415
This leaves no doubt whatsoever for trainer Tomasz Malmon .	-3.6463
Everyone continues to be fully motivated .	-3.6161
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-3.2262
" After all , I don 't know how a winning is so tasty , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-6.9277
Even though the Third League Reserve from Fredenbeck has not yet demolished trees , Malmon is sounding a warning in advance .	-6.3015
Many players have trained me in A-Youth .	-4.2517
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-4.3362
" Also , it is important to wait for the first step to be taken , " explains the SG-coach .	-6.7076
In order to finally return to the track of success , the Malmont team must surely increase in comparison with the past appearances .	-6.6636
Above all in the cover work and during the swing , it did a great job .	-7.0102
The exploitation of opportunities must definitely be improved .	-3.6254
So I hope that during the short break my players finally got their heads free .	-4.3463
Mozambique ’ s security concerns are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-2.5470
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputos under the watchful eye of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder and first president of Mozambique to make peace calls during a rare public demonstration .	-4.7244
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , director of an investment company .	-1.9168
For fear of the future of the country , she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “ We demand security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday of the independence place of the capital .	-6.7556
For two weeks , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , among the worst fighting since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-4.1170
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially run by White Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.7077
Following the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.9610
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will return to a full-fledged conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-4.5720
There is a lot at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring in investments of more than $ 50 billion from firms such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anarko from the US in the next few years .	-6.4216
The ruling Frelimo party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for the tensions .	-2.0317
Renamo claims that the government has provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the Province of Sofala , a traditional stronghold of Renato on 17 October .	-3.8488
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renam towers and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , Renamos said to the Financial Times .	-5.2484
The government is blaming Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-3.6102
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-1.4707
AFP , the French news agency , said on Wednesday that Dhlakama regards himself as a “ loser ” who wants to use “ all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.8357
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.6376
But there has been an increase in concerns since Mazanga quoted that Renamo gave up the 1992 peace agreement .	-5.0013
In comparison with the FT , he said that Frelimo no longer respect the agreement .	-4.3115
“ Our vision is to reopen negotiations and to do so seriously , ” Mazanga said .	-5.0049
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.9714
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who meet the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , a teacher at Open University and Mozambican expert .	-5.1939
None of them are good at negotiating and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-3.4375
Renamo , who is pressing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the November local elections .	-3.0389
presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.2193
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.9040
Renamos electoral decline since 1992 , while a newer party , the Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , founded by a former Renam member , will probably improve in the elections .	-5.3561
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term of office ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.2464
“ He does not want multiparty democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” Mazanga says .	-3.4580
It is unclear which capacity Renamo has , but it has made aggressive attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South link .	-4.4544
Most of the fighting took place in the Province of Sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but in which Beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale use to export coal .	-6.2217
In June , Rio broke out for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-3.1843
Mazanga responded cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat that threat .	-3.9199
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.9944
Instability has increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , director of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already had corruption , slow progress in development , and a recent wave of kidnapping .	-5.2184
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and that he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-3.2521
Omar sulane , a demonstrator , said people simply wanted stability .	-2.5988
“ None of them interested Renamo and Frelimo , they simply want peace and usable streets , ” he explained .	-4.0527
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models of life ” is an author .	-4.0818
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal power has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend shows how important it is to have a dream .	-3.4509
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland pleaded for a “ careful selection ” of age-just works .	-5.7167
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.2804
I have proposed this as a plan for twenty years .	-2.1146
He added that , among authors and teachers who are “ overly didactic ” , children would “ be shut off ” completely , because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ hidden . ”	-6.4900
Crossley Holland , who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myths and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can follow certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . ”	-4.9965
Perhaps the greatest difference between an adult author writing for adults , and an author writing for children , is the need to convey hope .	-3.3496
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an intrinsic sense of good and evil .	-2.7007
It must be represented in a subliminal way , revealed and not declared .	-6.1690
This is the old story of show rather than telling .	-2.2280
Hansjakob again moves to Freihof	-2.2193
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob acquired his retirement in Haslach , and on Sunday his last years were alive at the " Freihof " .	-5.4952

Not only was he received much applause from the audience , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-3.8721

The Mühlenbacher Landkapelle played played selected pieces of music between the different performances .	-6.6330
In order to award the citizens of honour , Hasach ’ s Mayor , Heinz Winkler , gave him the honour to attend the then official Hättich together with a part of the City Council .	-8.3365
Their wedding afterwards made the Trio Kings who led Hansjakob to exclaim : " Oh how beautiful , there are again youth memories of my own triathlon " .	-8.3586
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the public at the Freihof as well as the story junkies with their loud " omission " .	-7.0264
At that time , Hansjakob expressed his criticism of the Church of the State , as did his concerns about agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-6.8832
He found his resting place in the chapel behind his chapel on the fire at Hofstetten .	-4.8993
" A restless spirit had finally found its calmness and had gone home for ever , " it was at the end of the game of scenery .	-5.9288
There was much applause and many compliments from the audience for the performance .	-3.5098

However , the first breath from Ludwigsburg was not heard .	-5.5083
" We did not get involved in the wildcard procedure so long as it is not fixed that Düsseldorf does not receive a license , " said Neckar Giant Balls Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-6.4476

Ben Greenman : Ten Years New York Comedy Festival : The New York City .	-1.6321
One might say that New York City is the birthplace of Stand-up Comedy in America : just under a hundred years ago , the Varietekartist Frank Fay , who worked as Conérencier at the Palace Theatre on Broadway , began to tell the crowd of direct jokes in the form of a conversation .	-5.4407

Court is blocking decision on the NYPD ’ s stop-and-hair directive .	-4.1531
On Thursday , a federal court in the US blocked a judge ’ s order calling for changes to the New York Police Department ’ s stop-and-hair program ( “ Hold and Search ” ) , and expelled judges from the case .	-6.4651
The 2nd U.S. court declared that Judge Shira Scheidlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until the city was ruled .	-5.5104
The judge had laughed in August that the city was in contravention of the Constitution with the way in which the program for holding and dealing people was implemented .	-5.7726
The city appealed against its assessment and the appropriate remedial measures , including the decision to set up a surveillance body to assist the police in amending its directive and the appropriate training programme .	-5.4598
The appeal court heard on Tuesday the arguments for a suspension .	-3.6729
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be dismissed from the case , because she violated the Code of Conduct on US judges by stating that a judge should avoid the appearance of party ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she had publicly responded to the Court ’ s criticism .	-7.0677
The judge had laughed , police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people , because they mistakenly targeted black and Latin American men with the stop-and-hair program .	-5.5955
They appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of essential changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot programme with body powered cameras in quarters where most controls were carried out .	-5.4476
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people released after police control .	-3.6250

In 2004 , a complaint was lodged by four men , who belonged to all minorities , who became a collective redress .	-5.3435
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s stop-and-hair program say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , and influence the way other police presidents use the rule .	-5.4500
Opponents are the view that changes would dampen the morale of the police , but not crime ; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force that is under pressure after thousands of jobs have been lost in the last decade .	-6.1850
The judge pointed out that they do not end the stop-and-hair practice that is constitutional , but only reform the way the NYPD controls are implemented .	-5.4707

Coulson implemented telephone hacking for checking a tips .	-2.3422
Former news of the Word-editor Andy Coulson reportedly hired “ phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip about an affair by then-Interior Minister Charles Clarke .	-5.9647
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC declared to the Court in Old Bailey , News of the World in May 2005 , a false rumor heard that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special advisor ” Hannah Pawlby .	-4.2280
The newspaper commissioned Glenn Mulcaire ’ s private detective to hacking Pawlby ’ s Voices , and pursued them , but Coulson also appealed to them and left news about how the court learned .	-6.9878
“ According to the Public Prosecutor ’ s office , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , is no one who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to capture them in a fresh way , but one who likes to face people with a history to see their reaction , ” Edis explained .	-6.6397
He said that NotW uses three procedures to research stories carefully : phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-4.6189
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.2948
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , but it cannot be .	-4.0384
What about the first ?	-1.6527
Do he know about the phone hacking ?	-3.6722
He disputes that , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-3.1698
Rumours about an affair of Clarkes were first picked up by the NotW feature editor when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , she is together with Charles . ”	-4.8024
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three events was secured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-3.6604
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective on which Pawlby and her sister were saved as “ projects . ”	-4.1478
At the time when the search ran , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking them for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.6249
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the surveillance of Pawlby ’ s movements .	-3.9216
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow that I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-4.2954
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former interior minister David Blunket .	-4.2691
The jury heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunket faced a married woman on account of an affair when he was himself with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who was then married .	-7.3066
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have conspired with others to hack phones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-3.5097

" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning early stage " , Mayor Jens Häu<unk>ler opened the civil information event for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-6.3694
Around 80 participants had come to the Municipal Hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and bring ideas forward .	-5.7520
Skillers made it clear : " Ultimately the decisions are taken by the members of the local council .	-6.1086
The floods , which were unprepared on 15 May 2009 , were a drastic event that raised the question of protection for the future , hoists said .	-5.7011
A search for river regions was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of AIDS , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-6.7608

" There is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement we can achieve " , says Skipper .	-3.9313
In order to achieve the protection of the HQ 100aclimate , some four million euros must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality receiving approximately 70 % of national aid .	-7.7748
However , most of the time , it pointed out that there is no support unless an overall concept is implemented .	-6.8655
In order to do this , the community needs the involvement of its citizens .	-5.0112
An expensive planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.0639
In the best case , implementation can begin in 2016 .	-1.8539
Among other things , the concept of protection , which was already presented in the Municipal Council last week ( we reported ) , provides local measures in the inflow of the River Irm from the Stamheim Valley .	-5.9169
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took advantage of the opportunity to raise their concerns .	-2.9238
One of the questions raised was why dams and restraint basins are no longer planned to protect the place .	-5.6789

Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found on 11 January in an upright mat that was behind the grandstand in the school hall .	-6.4455
The Sheriff ’ s chief investigator of Lowende County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , but this casts doubt on the family of 17-year-old .	-5.0724
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” Benjamin Crump , the attorney of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , opposite FoxNews.com.	-3.2721
They would never have believed that he died as the Sheriff concluded .	-3.3101
“ They believe that there is no logic to break the laws of physics and common sense , ” says Crump .	-4.4391
Instead , they are convinced that the truth is being concealed in order to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-3.8453
“ Her son went to school to learn and returned to the body pack , ” he commented .	-3.8484
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death , because a number of important issues are still unresolved .	-3.6833
What was the cause of death ?	-0.7723
Is his death attributed to a crime ?	-1.5968
The Moore explained at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-2.2161
I follow the facts in what direction they are also taking .	-3.1862
My goal is to find out the truth .	-1.4939
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-3.0658
Moore explained to reporters who initially indicated that Johnson had died on the consequences of “ positional delivery . ”	-5.5182

CDC publishes allergies for schools	-2.0931
On Wednesday , the Center for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a set of guidelines for the treatment of food allergies in schools .	-3.6352
These are the first such directives that the US government has issued , as the number of children suffering from food allergies is rising .	-4.1156
One in 20 children in the United States now have a food allergy .	-1.8746
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children has increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.3982
The guidelines contain information for schools that are intended to raise an awareness of food allergies by the body and staff and how to deal with children who are allergic reactions .	-6.1774
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin preposterous – the autoinjection of the brand EpiPen is most commonly used – in order to meet a potentially fatal hypersensitivity response .	-5.3696
State legislators have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep Epinephrin more readily available .	-4.4027
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms referred to by children who are allergic to it .	-4.4152
Children may say , “ It feels like putting something on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair on it ” or “ my tongue crawling . ”	-5.0684
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender blank . ”	-3.7464
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with ununequivocal genital mutilation .	-3.6001
Newborn children are no longer recruited by men or women .	-4.2907
Under the new law , parents no longer have to declare a gender for such children , but can claim “ unspecified ” or “ not defined ” on the birth certificate .	-5.8694
The aim of the law is to exert pressure on parents so that they do not have to take hasty decisions on operations for the provision of sexual care in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-8.4738
An intersexual person , according to the BBC , said years later : “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ” , , and , , , , , and . , , , and . , , , and ,	-7.1631
I remain the patchwork created by doctors , maimed and full of scars .	-2.9678
It is estimated that one in 2000 children every year come neither as a boy nor as a girl .	-3.3359
They are among the intersexual , a group falling under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation ” ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( ovaries or testicles ) , or otherwise developed genital mutilation .	-6.5534
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.8004
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most US experts advise that the best available sexual information should be used if a provision is not possible , rather than waiting for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before deciding , if at all , for an operation .	-6.5428
The New Yorker psychiatrist Dr Jack Drescher , who specializes in the issue of gender identification , said the new German law “ sounding after a good thing . ”	-4.0919
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.3064
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but most children do not , ” he said .	-3.3999
You can determine the gender allocation without an operation and then wait and see how the identity develops .	-4.9903
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity are not very accurate .	-2.7763
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.4175
It is like the secret why people are gay .	-1.5784
In a report to the European Commission in 2011 , it is stated that intersexual people are different from transsexual or transgendered people , because their status is not gender , but because of their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but which typically defines both at the same time or not clearly one of them .	-6.2189
These characteristics have been shown in the following sexual characteristics : muscle mass , respiratory , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genital mutilation , or chromo structures and hormones .	-6.8451
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender people in professional life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice crime .	-4.8611
Not boys matching the gender picture now have a special camp .	-4.1304
Meanwhile , in Australia and Nepal , it is possible for adults to refer to official documents of male , female or “ third sex . ”	-4.0083
In June , Australians Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ gender-less ” person , after a court had granted the lifetime of “ unspecified ” gender status .	-4.8917
In addition to M and W , German identification cards will have a third assignment , X for intersexual , so the Ministry of the Interior .	-4.7089
In neighboring France , sexual issues are still controversial , so a news announcement at France 24 .	-3.7774
In 2011 , dozens of French MPs from the strictly Catholic country signed a petition to remove “ gender theory ” from school books .	-2.3485
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed German law , on the grounds that “ If the world is dragged into a new state , where gender is a decision , but sexual activity is not , then we are turning two further pillars of civilisation . ”	-6.4814
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told Baby Zone that she would feel better if babies were assigned a gender at birth .	-4.9617
“ The parent is already stressful enough without any further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your own child , ” she said to the parent website .	-5.2898
Children need stability and security .	-0.6323
Historically , children born both male and female were referred to as Hermapphrodides , according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes .	-4.8657
Even ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something to be eliminated and then rebuilt .	-4.0569
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels in growing up with the gender allocated to them .	-5.9295
“ In the mid-twentieth century , one called this a psychiatric emergency , ” Drescher said .	-3.4876
When such a child was born , people did not call the psychiatrist but the surgeon .	-3.1244
The dominant theory about the treatment of children with ununequivocal genitals dates back to John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who believed that gender could be formalized .	-6.0950
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental impulses – as parents train a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , implying whether a person looks male or female .	-4.8079
But , in a case known as “ John / Joan ” in 1966 , his theories became controversial .	-3.1321
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off at a certain time , to lock the child completely and also to remove his testicles and then dress him as a girl .	-7.7246
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , but it was not , ” Drescher said .	-3.8112
When the boy was about 15 , he switched back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.0499
With 38 but committing suicide .	-2.3379
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practise this model .	-1.9204
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations appeared to the public , who “ are not happy with the result . ”	-3.9597
For example , at Jim Bruce , a 36 year old Montana author born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-4.6077
The doctors were not clear about whether he had a large clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-4.6979
So his external organ and the testicles were removed surgical shortly after birth in 1976 and he was enlarged as a girl .	-4.9307
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.9529
“ I knew I was not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com	-3.6852
I was unhappy , but it was really hard to ask questions .	-1.6589
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal lastics .	-2.4837
But , because he was depressive and knew that something was wrong , he demanded his medical files .	-3.9419
What he found out was shocking .	-0.9643
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one ever told me .	-2.5994
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterone for the development of genital organs .	-5.0766
After learning the truth , he changed to male identity again , received testosterone injections and left his breasts removed .	-4.8312
It has become infertile by the surgery .	-2.5994
Today , he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to ensure that intersexual people are perceived as normal .	-4.5768
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , California ’ s director , Advocates for Informed Choice , argues that the German law “ could encourage stamp and stigmatisation . ”	-4.6920
“ Many activists are concerned that the German decision might encourage parents to make quick decisions and to give the child a non-determined “ , she explained .	-6.3291
We fear that this will encourage intervention .	-2.9543
We think it would be better to allocate male or female sex and then wait .	-2.2406
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.2932
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as a third gender . ”	-3.6847
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.6098
German law concerns the assignment at birth .	-2.4698
This is not a fight to which small children should be forced at this time .	-3.5000
When they grow up , they can decide their own body .	-2.6878
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a Pittsburg breast radiologist , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ Authorized ” , both parents and children .	-5.1274
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgenresistant .	-3.1714
Due to the defect of the target cells for testosterone , Katie developed female characteristics .	-2.8916
She has a vaginal , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-3.4217
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she works at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist .	-3.6715
Although she is infertile , she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-3.1465
“ The law gives parents room , which means that they do not have to make hasty decisions , ” Baratz said .	-4.1862
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things , giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female ” .	-4.5601
In this way , everything is fine – you pull the child large and love it .	-4.9061
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the parental happiness .	-3.5458
And you do not need to rush into an operation that cannot be reversed .	-4.8331
“ That includes children in the decision , and it explained the fear that parents are shifting because they believe they are not doing the right thing . ”	-4.9932
Ultimately , the child decides the sex that suits him better – and that is wonderful .	-3.6133
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-2.6496
Unknown girls hurt by car shot	-3.5016
Unknown people have hurt a twelve-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when driving from a car .	-4.7454
The perpetrators probably fired an air pressure weapon on a group of children on Thursday evening in Genthin .	-4.6312
This was shared by the police in Burg .	-2.9511
The girl was slightly injured on the left hand .	-2.1243
Rescue forces brought the girl to hospital .	-2.0501
The shot came from a small car passing to a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-3.7425
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-0.8868
The perpetrators also shot a bus stop .	-2.4428
A disc broke down .	-1.9726
Then they were .	-3.2300
The crime show was identified on Friday .	-3.1081
So far , the police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-4.0006
Officials were only called twice for lauding children , who threw them against house facades .	-6.4438
As homeowners recognized this in good time , and the remains of the eggs removed equally , no material damage will have arisen .	-6.1886
Some New Year ’ s oil engines were also bred in the city , but no material damage has been done here either .	-8.6272
A neighbouring in the Bischof-friendly way indicated that his passenger car was wrapped up with toilet paper and that his bicycle caps were removed .	-7.8668
However , until police arrived , the man found out all his bicycle faces in the immediate vicinity , so the police had to stop taking action .	-7.9048
Living with a Future	-1.7321
Actually , Waltrad Ries lives fantastically .	-3.6543
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with lots of green , old trees , nice neighbors and not too much traffic .	-3.6692
It is only a few minutes by public transport to the city .	-2.7394
" I hope you have no fear of spikes ? " , asks Waltrad Ries and shows on a greasy spider on the door frame .	-5.7466
I have been looking for a new apartment for some time for my husband and myself .	-2.7555
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.6253
The reason , however , is not a pipe phobia , but the concern that at the age the many steps to the house and the apartment can no longer be overcome is explained .	-6.3117
In addition : Since a Menisus-operation , the tutor has had to know his own body what it means to move with a handicap on the floor .	-6.2302
Only recently is a book published by her about ' happiness at age - Which form of living is the best for me ? ' .	-4.8950
'Our apartment is the best example of what is not going on at age ' , it begins to tell .	-4.3698
When she moved her husband to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green countryside .	-4.5971
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltrad Ries thinks differently about it .	-4.2978
However , she also knows that she is one of the few people who even deal with the issue of ' living at age ' .	-5.4373
Most of these are dispelled as long as it is possible .	-4.2306
Old are always just the others ' , says them pretty .	-4.1004
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great can we think about it .	-4.2299
'Then it can also be too late ' , so Ries .	-4.3640
In her book , the interior designers present 17 models of living for a self-determined age .	-5.6790
'Which form of housing you choose , however , is always an individual decision ' , explains it .	-3.7987
D i e solution do not exist for age .	-1.9051
Even if you can afford the retirement age in Tuscany or Brittany , you should always consider that it can also become ill .	-5.2464
And : ' Without good knowledge of the language one can also join in the Dolce Vita , ' the expert writers must consider in the candidates for relocation .	-9.1863
Among their models are classic systems of care , alternative forms of housing , or the often quoted Rentner WG .	-6.0154
At the Age , everyone has their ticks and Macs	-4.8862
" For me , a community like this would not be anything , " she says with a finger .	-7.7900
Not at all like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-3.8494
'At the age you just need your retreat ' , so giant .	-5.7548
However , the authors do not want to rule out the fact that a senior community can still work .	-5.6949
But that should then be different from the classic student contract .	-4.8650
And sometimes you just want rest , " she believes .	-4.2340
With this opinion , at least in the capital city , it is not alone .	-5.0520
" Most of the old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home , " is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the director of civic services life at the age of the state capital .	-5.1438
Her office advises people around the topic of becoming older .	-3.4294
This is why older people , in particular , would often take advantage of inconvenience and restrictions , only to be able to stay in their usual environment , which is also the experience of the Stiftung Warentest .	-6.5175
There are many ways to make the house or apartment accessible today .	-4.0047
It is recommended to all those who are involved in the age-just conversion of their home or home , to provide thorough information and not to hire the best artisans .	-9.6591
Today there are also specialists for the conversion of old .	-4.7035
Even in the rental apartment you can realize one or the other , and if it is only a toilet seat increase , the interior designers clarify .	-7.1100
But it is not always possible to change the existing apartment in an age-friendly way , even if it is still so beautiful .	-6.6598
This experience had to make Waltrad Ries .	-2.2586
There was a lift in the apartment , which was also paved with stairs to the door , but that would be a far greater obstacle .	-8.5750
She will continue searching until she has found the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.5174
Before moving , she greys more than before the spider on her home door .	-4.4021
America ’ s Will prosecute Snowden Still	-3.2553
The US has not changed its position on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.2902
He continues to be accused of providing illegal secret information .	-4.6498
As a result , he must face criminal proceedings in the US , said the US Department of Foreign Affairs , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-4.3298
Nor would the latest comments by Snowden change that .	-3.8165
Before that , Germany ’ s Green politician , Hans-Christian Ströbele , had appealed to the US for a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , not to continue to threaten him with punishment .	-5.7463
Psaki stressed that Strobeles ’ statements are those of a parliamentarian , not that of a German member of the government .	-7.0066
The secret service provider Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities .	-4.8442
First of all , however , he wants to clarify his situation .	-3.2615
The former NSA staff sought by the United States made this clear in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and directed to the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the Federal Attorney General .	-6.8763
The letter has the following wording , which is spoken : , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.9646
People in charge	-3.1437
I have been asked to write to you on your mass surveillance inquiry .	-2.8937
My name is Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or directly employed as a technical expert on the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-4.3214
In the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of my government ’ s law , which led me to be morally obliged to act .	-5.3663
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was faced with a serious and sustained behemoth that forced me to leave my family and home .	-4.5820
I live in exile at the moment and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.4066
I am encouraged by the resonance of my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-1.9001
Citizens around the world , as well as senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations about a system of all-encompassing surveillance that nobody is accountable to be a service to the public .	-4.9665
These spy revelations made many proposals about new laws and policies aimed at the previously covert abuse of public confidence .	-4.7815
The benefits to society from these insights are increasingly clear , while the risks involved in purchasing have been visibly reduced .	-4.9879
Although the outcome of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a pipe dream and seeks to criminalise and charge political expression .	-5.0713
But the truth is not a crime .	-2.4723
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this dismissive attitude .	-3.0532
I hope that , if the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate appropriately and legally in the responsible investigation of the issues relating to the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of reports .	-6.3102
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to preserve the international law that protects us all .	-3.8883
Edward Snowden testified by Hans-Christian Strobele .	-2.2578
Kindergarten has found a private buyer .	-1.8675
" The building is in good hands " says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.4864
The former Kindergarten on the garden road sold to a private person .	-3.8938
The Council of the Community agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public sector .	-5.4129
The building changed its owner to a " reasonable " price .	-2.4430
" The municipality is satisfied " , says Maier .	-2.6150
EUR 100 000 was allocated in the budget .	-2.5928
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the previous kindergarten . , , and .	-4.6895
The mayor is right that Winterlingen has handed over responsibility for the building to someone before the winter and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look to the garden and leave the walkway .	-6.3810
" This effort is now away , " is glad Maier .	-3.5247
Concert in High Summer Temperatures	-2.7792
The Musikverein Hammersenbach gives a seating concert on the terrace of the guest house Hammer .	-4.5933
As conductor Bianca Willmann lifts the clock at 7.30 p.m. , the thermometer still shows 25 degrees .	-3.1029
About 50 listeners enjoy the sounds of the Hammricher musician .	-3.1830
The chairman Manuela Honeck explains the musical pieces .	-2.5077
In this context , honey thanked all those who had helped to successfully manage the first music anniversary .	-5.3992
Report : Obama ’ s campaign aimed at replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton .	-2.7856
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers privately thought replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in 2012 ’ s 2012 election campaign , the New York Times .	-3.5953
The revelation is the most notable surprise of Mark Halperin ’ s long-awaited work and John Heilemann ’ s 2012 campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-3.9164
The Times is a copy of the upcoming book , and she reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had “ performed extensive group meetings and polls at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s diminishing hope for re-election would be better off if he let Biden drop .	-6.9342
According to Jonathan Martin , a National correspondent of the Times , the book thoroughly illustrates the history of the efforts of senior staff in the campaign and the White House , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the effect of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice-Presidents .	-6.3989
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.2164
Only half a dozen of president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , the former campaign leader Obama , Jim Messina , and former White House advisers , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change .	-3.5233
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley has spearheaded efforts to exchange Biden despite its “ close , personal relationship , ” before ultimately choosing such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not improve Obama ’ s chances much . ”	-6.7305
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government actually thought to replace Biden with Clinton .	-2.4540
“ I said a lot of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained the magazine .	-3.3275
It must be remembered that the president at that time had terrible poll numbers , so we thought : “ For God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-5.1479
While Daley called the investigation “ due diligence , ” Martin opposite Anderson Cooper of CNN said that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a move would pay for the ballot boxes .	-6.2938
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think seriously about something , ” Martin said on AC360 .	-4.1637
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was looking for an exchange .	-2.7091
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley whether his former boss knew about the potential change .	-5.5527
While Daley explained that he did not believe that the president of the possible change was “ aware , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew it .	-7.3069
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether the political probes have reached Obama ’ s desk .	-4.0832
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama knew nothing about the investigation into whether to let Biden drop in the elections .	-4.2576
Martin won .	-3.5396
What happens on the way with my email ?	-1.8920
Email actually means electronic letter .	-2.9257
Was the design of the Internet service email similar to the conventional mail translated into technical secrecy ?	-6.2581
In the early concept of Internet services , the focus was on making communication possible .	-4.3529
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not been respected in establishing a stable foundation for a correspondence that is safe for hearing .	-6.7625
Therefore , a conventional mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.8683
When users send an email to " Benni " , are the hosts of the two connected ?	-4.1341
The email program or browser of Anna sends in the first step the mail to the mail server of their service provider .	-6.5482
For example , if she has a retail account , that would be Google .	-3.1862
This mail server sends the content to the provider that uses it .	-3.5729
The mail can run over a number of other servers on the Internet .	-4.0028
Bennie can then call the contents to his provider .	-4.4346
Do conventional mails be read along their way through the network ?	-4.2753
Most mails are read by software robots on the way .	-2.2501
The sender 's provider is usually checked if the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment .	-5.9369
A virus check is also done on the recipient systems .	-2.6361
Furthermore , providers verify whether it is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is deleted immediately or at least sorted away into a spam folder .	-5.9885
Are the robots yet another task ?	-2.7609
On systems such as retail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.2455
If Anna and Benni communicate via mail about their coming holiday destinations , Google may provide links to holiday offers .	-5.4951
Do unknown people also read the emails ?	-3.1292
The probability of unauthorized persons reading a mail is extremely low .	-2.7220
In theory , this is possible .	-1.6754
In companies , administrators often have the ability to read electronic mail .	-2.1096
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails .	-3.7438
There are also possible illicit statements .	-4.0379
Is it possible to protect email against reading ?	-3.3337
An email can be encrypted using the OpenPGP standard .	-2.7281
With high technical effort , it is also possible to disguise the metadata of an e-mail communication , so that it is not even easy to recognize who has communicated with whom .	-5.9805
How important are Yahoo and Google on the email market in Germany ?	-1.4067
According to a survey conducted by Convios Consulting in August 2013 , Yahoo and Google play a minor role in the mailboxes used mainly for private use .	-5.8718
While the shares of Yahoo-Mail were last appreciated , Gmail could clearly purchase them from Google .	-5.7045
Mother in the Forest Suspensions	-6.9681
When his sister died , a man from Wolfsburg drew up a plan .	-3.7874
He executed the deaths in a forest - and continued to collect their pension and pension money .	-5.1879
A 67-year-old Wolfsburg buried his dead mother after police investigations in the forest .	-4.4548
First of all , he has postponed the death of the 89-year-old , and he has cut the money over a year and a half .	-5.5393
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-2.9175
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.2430
The man was suspected already in May : it was discovered that medicines were no longer needed for the needy mother .	-4.8403
The pensioners told them that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-2.9719
Because the officials were curiously aware of this , they continued to investigate it .	-4.9801
It emerged that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that he had recently been maintaining it .	-6.7629
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.0600
Obeation , according to the police , did not reveal any capital crimes .	-4.7495
Fancy ice cream that shines in the dark ?	-3.1789
A British entrepreneur has developed the first ice shining in the dark – with the help of qualifications .	-4.5449
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescence properties of marine animals and created a shining leatherwork .	-5.4097
The idea came to him after reading a research on quality and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein .	-4.7860
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consumed , increasing the pH in the protein and releasing the light .	-4.6571
Chris explains that the ice reacts to the warmth in the mouth and bright – the more you leak , the brighter it becomes .	-4.6711
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious , ” says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early stage of production , giving two grams of it to <unk> 200 . ”	-4.5832
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.8851
When the mouth is warming the protein , the pH value rises and the ice shines .	-3.2703
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed to us ideal to put it on the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-5.2456
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever made , because the quality luminaire is four times more expensive than gold .	-2.9745
Every ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-2.0602
But it is delicious .	-3.0221
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-3.4662
But his latest creation should become even more ambitious .	-2.0424
He says , “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-2.4901
This is , and in itself , impossible because of the refraction caused by the ice cream , but I suspect that we find a way to create it .	-5.7323
The ice cream uses the fluorescence of a quality produced by Chinese scientists artificially .	-2.9256
After six days of playing , TSV Morsum still has no point in the handball club .	-4.3801
Now it ’ s time for the team of Ingo Ehler to win the Derby against TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-5.3657
This game starts the season anew for us .	-2.8007
" I hope that we are finally free of our heads , " Ehler 's behaviour is optimistic .	-4.7315
He finally has his complete cadres , with the exception of the permanently injured Hendrik Blohme .	-5.5340
Even Daverden sets on tempo play .	-5.7335
Therefore , we must keep our error rate low .	-4.4146
But above all we need to increase our coverage , which has left everything but a certain impression .	-6.4610
After the first season of victory against Nordhorn , Daverden coach Thomas Panitz is clearly more relaxed .	-5.1491
The game was of course a house number .	-1.4366
But that ’ s why we ’ re far from the favorite , because everything can always happen in Derby .	-4.4527
However , Panitz now wants to put up in Morsum to start a series .	-4.1675
No will Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.4150
The A-Youths Joost Windssel , who is active with double play right with the A-Youth Club HC Bremen , celebrates his seasonal debut .	-7.6982
Those who don ’ t love such a game should stay at home .	-3.9006
Halloween 2013 : In Figures	-1.3618
When I was small , Halloween had something magical .	-2.5527
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and taste us for the neighborhood .	-2.9196
Today I became the Halloween-Muffel . . , , , , , , , ,	-4.0829
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute candy from my home , and I do not think I will do so this year .	-5.7314
However , according to statistics , I am a black sheep in terms of halloween .	-2.6347
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , giving a total of $ 6.9 billion for sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Federation of Retailers ( NRF ) .	-4.3069
One thing I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-3.8153
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the USD 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.9233
This year , exciting unlived objects are the last cry .	-4.0810
Women no longer have to hide in sexy clothing , they can now also embody tempting food , such as pizza , hamburger or carats .	-5.6687
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft-Punk-Cosmen will create it this year into the Instagroam feeds .	-4.4020
According to Google , the most searched costumes are Zombies , Batman , pirates and witches .	-3.0902
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.3478
Last year we met our dogs and , to my astonishment , were not alone .	-3.9279
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes for their pets , say the NRF .	-2.6456
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-1.8061
As far as candy is concerned , we are not ciderless .	-3.6022
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , says The Nielsen Company .	-1.6254
This is about 270 million kilograms of chocolate , salmon , candies and rubber balls .	-4.1178
So good news for the 41 million people , according to the US Department of Commerce , who drag through the quarter with the phrase “ sweetes or saures ” .	-5.6823
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let ’ s not fool us – eat .	-4.3164
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn ; however , 15 million kilograms of it is sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of sweeteners manufacturers .	-5.1334
These are about nine billion grains of corn .	-2.3295
It is a riddle that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.4607
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses that make it so special .	-3.9922
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Wall ” ( which is actually a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-4.4559
There are indeed 1,200 officially recognized splukhouses in the United States that generate $ 500 million in revenue , America Haunts says , and that includes the wonderful photos on which you are pinning into the trousers and friends then on Facebook , where you are not going to get rid of them , and one of the type on which you stand leaves a comment like “ nice facial expression ” .	-10.2284
But we finally get to the pumpkin .	-2.6137
Charlie Brown made us familiar with the Great Kürbis when we were children , and the carving of a pumpkin lamp is like the smashing of the Christmas tree – something we have done from small .	-5.7810
Fortunately , the “ baby in the pumpkin ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with mixing the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-4.1811
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , US Census Bureau .	-1.8979
The pumpkin lamp , which slowly rotates in the front garden , is presumably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year .	-5.6717
If you want to take the right points , call Tim and Susan Mathisidon in Napa , California , and carve some sweet from their 921 kg heavy pumpkin .	-6.5791
Living party in Helmholtz ’ s right : Rescue forces collect stolen bodies	-6.7824
The fire brigade had to put the fire brigade off in Helmholden ’ s right on the late Thursday evening .	-5.6726
A three-family house in the county of Hof begins fire at night .	-3.4282
The rescue forces have a stolen body from the house .	-3.4461
Rescue forces have found a stolen body in a three-family house on a fire in Helmshright-wing .	-5.3453
Whether it is a resident still unclear , as a police spokesman in Bayreuth said .	-4.4304
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.1902
When the fire brigade met , the flames already beat out of a window .	-3.3311
The forces deployed went into the apartment and found the bodies in a room .	-4.9381
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-4.7974
The entire ground floor has been damaged .	-1.5427
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to explain .	-4.2833
The building is no longer habitable for now .	-3.5475
The exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .	-2.5196
Germany ’ s largest national church has started an offensive to promote the pastor profession .	-2.9328
Background is a potential parrot : The Evangelic-Lutheran Church of Hannover expects that the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors and pastors will be halved by 2030 .	-9.7722
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said Pastor Mathis Burfeen ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical Press Service .	-5.0688
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and daily flow .	-4.7921
With Burfeen , the National Church has for the first time assigned a pastor to inspire young people to study theology .	-6.1220
At present , fewer and fewer young people are choosing to study theology .	-3.3606
Burfeen returns this to the process of dekirification : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-4.1925
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.8509
I am the chairman of my calendar and can set my priorities where I am concerned .	-6.0122
Pastors could be very close to people as sailors .	-3.1281
They deserve as much as teachers and could well live on them .	-2.9894
Of course , the free economy is paying more , but Theologists would have a safe employer to do so .	-4.5387
This is true of today ’ s young people , who are not only looking for careers , but for a happy job .	-7.3686
According to the National Church , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 berths are currently retired each year .	-4.7304
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology degree start their Viking .	-4.2224
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the Harz , the Emsland or the Wendland it will be hard to occupy positions in the future .	-4.4689
Burfeen wants to organise study days for young people and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-5.9941
Theology studies offer broad education .	-4.0193
It can even become the president of the federal government .	-3.5851
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.5303
In interior , there are race seats and six-point belts as well as a hands-free system .	-4.4980
The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with the assistance of Bowler Workers and logistical support to vehicle reception between events .	-5.7143
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-4.2369
They are not all experienced riders , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure , as well as an achievable way to world class events .	-5.0965
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new opportunities to experience the different rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare newcomers to the strains and the reality of Rally Raid .	-6.1710
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – that will be an entertaining championship .	-4.0290
The Defender Challenge also hosts a training and test day in February , as well as the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-4.7924
Fire brigade called for the rescue of a hip that was stuck on a dangerous rock jump in a quarry 15 meters above the ground .	-5.6577
Cockerspan-bitch Ruby ran away after a small traffic accident .	-4.0202
Three days later , she was discovered in her predicament by a quarry worker .	-3.6620
Firemen picked themselves up on the rock wall and rescued the dog from the safe death .	-4.7108
The fire brigade managed to secure a chasm that was hanging on a rocky wall on a 15m high front .	-6.5030
The nine months old Cockerspani-Hündin Ruby had gone away after a car accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .	-5.2925
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to welcome Ruby again and to thank the firemen of West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-4.7191
They had desperately searched for their missing bitch and published requests for help on social networks when they had escaped the minor traffic accident in the quarry .	-5.6014
About 14 : 15 p.m. on Wednesday , a walkers watching his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meter high section of the quarry .	-7.5946
The Cleckheaton Fire Station ’ s technical rescue team ran out and started to rescue Ruby , which was then transported up in a dog box .	-6.1703
Andy Clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.5993
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 metres from the top and the ground .	-3.8656
She didn ’ t move the muscle during her rescue – she was as stiff frozen .	-4.4156
But now it is doing well .	-1.9518
She then eaten a few dog balls .	-3.2658
That was quite an unusual undertaking .	-2.7842
The fact that the dog has been discovered is unbelievable .	-1.5469
Peter Lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge happy . ”	-3.6613
It was possible that she was very seriously injured or worse .	-2.4780
Ruby was brought to the veterinary , but it didn 't notice anything except exhaustion and dehydration .	-5.9799
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ At the rescue was frightening . ”	-3.3231
I could not believe that she really was up there . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.5834
It was wonderful to keep them back to the poor .	-2.2214
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too large and it had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-4.0704
Firemen have done a great deal .	-2.8821
It was really brave about what they have done .	-2.9420
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.3941
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid that she would fall , but she stayed up . ”	-3.5227
The firemen were great .	-1.9062
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.2220
Mick Jagger says he never married Kathy Perry when she was 18 .	-3.7714
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she worked as a backgrove singer on Jaggers song “ Old Habits The Hard ” from 2004 .	-4.2881
Perry said she had dinner with the rocker and that “ he added me when I was 18 . ”	-4.2254
She added : “ This has been long ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.6389
In a statement , a representative Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever attempted to approach Katy Perry . ”	-3.9730
The representative added : “ Perhaps she had confused him with someone else . ”	-3.1762
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance on this year 's Rolling Stones Tour .	-3.2203
Her new album “ Prism ” landed on 1st position this week .	-4.4714
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives Scotland the choice	-3.7184
A new day , a new history of terror for independence .	-2.3299
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.1797
This provides the keyword for stories about passing controls in Berwick and a border secured with barbed wire along the Hadrian walls .	-4.9461
Indeed , the Stratclyde proposal drew attention to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , as expected , it did not matter in the headlines .	-5.1005
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is cheaper for them .	-4.1384
As Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area , continuing disregard for Brussels would be just a small concession in return for what the Scots really want .	-5.0260
So it is not a story .	-2.9604
And one that has come so long that it is already like a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” last 40 years .	-4.6980
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-4.5451
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance after the European pipe ?	-3.3062
Why the London yoke exchange for that from Brussels , especially now ?	-2.3748
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled .	-3.2373
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-1.8629
Throughout the EU , parties are gaining ground that are hostile to the EU or want to throw the euro out as a common currency .	-3.7598
Even in Germany , the Euroskeptic Party ’ s alternative to Germany – founded only this year – offered almost five million votes in the September federal election , effectively banishing the Free Democrats ( the equivalent of the British Liberal Democrats ) from the Bundestag .	-5.9801
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-2.0001
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-2.3017
Because of the stringent austerity policies imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , in connection with the straitjacket in which the national economy is being forced by adhering to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-5.1758
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-2.8577
Instead , the Eurosystem has stuck its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians would like to leave that way .	-4.6123
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , southern Europe has a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-4.2910
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-3.6929
Behind current budget and currency problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.6816
As a result of Brussels ’ “ green ” energy lines – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-4.0513
This is a paralysing cost supplement , as we saw in Grangemouth .	-5.0467
All world wage notes do not protect the European petrochemical industry from being pushed from cheap US shale gas into the corner .	-3.1682
As a result , a revolt is emerging , particularly in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.5018
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to rein in Germany and bring Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.8903
But Berlin does not need more than a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe into its own economic policy , which is what the French economy is struggling .	-6.0013
The result is that Marine Le Pen ’ s far-right , anti-EU National Front has just won a critical re-election , thus placing the governing socialists in three .	-5.4078
The Front National is now France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that splitting on the right would automatically bring benefits to the left .	-4.8616
What does Le Pen do with her newly gained popularity among the white men of the working class ?	-3.0868
It would like to use the EU elections next year to forge an anti-EU anti-Community monetary block in the European Parliament .	-3.3755
If anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-4.0819
This is the point I want to make : in the not-too-distant future , the growing opposition to the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-4.8794
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations , ” which General de Gaulle favored .	-3.2979
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.5346
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of joining the United States .	-3.2920
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific region suggests that Britain alone will be in Atlantic rain .	-2.2838
Where is Scotland , with all this ?	-2.8918
We can decide to be a small ( final ) region .	-3.6031
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including , say , Berlin and Brussels , what they can get to where .	-4.7252
I suspect Scotland could do well in an easy European grouping if we retain our own currency .	-5.0404
Cooperation with other similarly thinking countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations .	-4.8557
Otherwise , we should consider doing likewise and maintaining our economic independence .	-3.3476
The SNP government in Scotland – remarkably – is the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and in 2011 won a spectacular majority , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem-Ko-coalition had to answer .	-5.6914
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence only if austerity were imposed on Berlin and Brussels .	-3.6140
Early Puberty : Growing Up	-5.3853
AfrAmerican and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers , as studies show .	-2.2703
Physical changes do not directly affect puberty .	-2.6487
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.3616
Experts believe that epidemiological obesity is a catalyst for early puberty .	-2.6751
The trend toward early puberty is less pronounced among boys	-2.0167
Former CNN correspondent Pat Etherridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-2.6855
Should a mother be worried when their daughter grows breasts and shambles at the age of seven or eight ?	-3.8260
At the annual conference of the Medical Association of American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovitz explained that these early physical changes are relatively normal among American girls and pose a new standard .	-4.5328
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually that is no sign of quick puberty , ” Kaplowitz explained .	-5.4243
Obvious indicators of development , such as growing breasts , chamois and asses as well as body rounded , are shown in girls sooner .	-6.1029
However , there has been only a slight shift in the age of the Menarch ( occurrence of the first blood control ) in the last 40 years .	-5.8396
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.6737
“ If the evolution of breasts begins , it will take at least two to three years to go to the Menarche , ” said Kaplovitz , also author of the book “ Early Puberty in girls : The essential guide for dealing with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-6.9335
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty advances .	-1.9446
It is controversial , which is indeed the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” when the expansion of the breast is accompanied by a growth boost of eight years ago .	-5.1151
In most cases , the process is slow or stagnating – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor .	-2.7387
When moving faster , tests could be shown by an endicronologist so that serious problems such as tumours or cysts can be excluded .	-5.1562
There are treatments to delayed early menstruation and defense of another consequence : premature aging of bones , which can ultimately lead to growth and consequently to small body growth in adults .	-6.4140
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the growth rate and the emotional maturity .	-4.8199
Psychological aspects are also important .	-2.3361
Kaplowitz is cautious about drugs , but he admits : “ The oppressing of puberty can alleviate behavioural problems and feelings of girls , unlike their peers . ”	-5.6879
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-2.1552
“ They care for the maternity risk or about how they handle the hygiene side , ” Kaplovitz said .	-4.4985
“ It was a shock , ” recalls a woman whose daughter had received ten her days .	-3.1566
Although there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was emotionally unprepared .	-4.8835
She came scared and excited from school to home because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-3.6166
There are many comprehensive published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.6301
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media are the cause .	-4.3459
boys get into puberty just like girls .	-3.7744
Kaplovitz believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic .	-2.8472
He supported the implementation of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , which establishes a connection between body fat and entering puberty .	-5.3742
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.3886
In this country , Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white peers .	-2.4945
There are different explanations for this .	-1.6934
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-2.5673
Another riddle : although boys grow their face and shame earlier , the trend toward a full-fledged former puberty is not as pronounced as in girls .	-5.4303
Other doctors at the AAP conference highlight the complexity of the topic .	-2.1476
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common even with babies and infants .	-3.8726
" We must be careful about how we identify the true beginning of puberty , " said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.6709
Parents should not hesitate to consult their pediatrician how to talk to their child .	-3.2902
“ This can mean having to talk earlier than expected , ” says Kaplovitz .	-4.0598
If you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .	-2.5217
Girls who flourish early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if they enter earlier than intended .	-3.8417
Jumbo manufacturer argue in the face of large orders over seat width	-2.6687
There has been an argument between leading aircraft manufacturers over the breadth of seats in the tourist class at long distance flights , indicating the tone for a bitter collision on the Dubai Airshow this month .	-5.0989
The argument is about the seat width offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who are most concerned with airlines , but this excluded area is the key to the efficiency claims of the latest Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-6.6986
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrivale Boeing says that the airlines should decide .	-4.3644
At a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long haul aircraft , and they expect record orders at the event from November 17th to 21st .	-6.5367
How the rear part of the aircraft is equipped – especially if there are rows of nine or ten seats – is crucial to the indicated economic results that the new “ mini Jumbo ” design will deliver .	-6.2493
Boeing claims that its modernized 777X makes 406 seats in the tourist class , which are more than 17 inches wide , allowing ten per row .	-5.8615
Airbus states that the competing A350 will be hosting 350 people in 18 inches wide in the tourist class , with nine per series .	-5.7821
Aircraft giants often provide input via technical details via advertising in the specialized press .	-5.2197
Airbus is now calling for the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X , with over 100 orders , is expected to run directly to the public .	-4.8935
Recently , the company unveiled an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new ad war , showing donors a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-6.5472
“ Boeing proposes long-range flights in seats that are closer than regional turbo-ropes , ” says Airbus Sales Manager John Leahy .	-4.6220
With changes in dietary habits , people are becoming fatter , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-4.9234
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined the modern long-haul journey , and the end of the century , the average American has increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to the data of the US Department of Health .	-5.3460
In the 21st century , according to US health statistics , the labor force for the male average American is 100.8 cm .	-5.1654
Airbus says that its rival is based on a 1950s seating concept , when the average body size of the newly wrapped “ jet set ” was smaller .	-6.2123
According to Airbus , tests were carried out that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleeping quality by 53 % .	-5.9492
Boeing denies Airbus ’ figures on its location and says that it is not at the manufacturers ’ discretion to decide how airlines will balance air fares and equipment .	-5.8970
The company also explains that , according to tests , the plane experience depends on more than the seating width .	-4.5932
“ It really amounts to giving airlines flexibility so that they can do what they believe to be successful , ” explains the aviation expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-4.7696
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.4713
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.2495
For passengers , this is about greater freedom of elbows , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue that can affect sales .	-6.5790
The contest is behind a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of US $ 700 billion at list prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-5.6154
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets .	-2.8518
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat with their latest twin-engine long-range designs as the market leader in this segment , the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.9712
The specifications Boeings to the results depend in part on the fact that the 777X is compared with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-4.6372
Increased costs per unit are still lower than those currently used with ten seats per unit .	-3.0887
“ Boeing therefore chooses more aircraft seats to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Kenston , Head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-4.1992
On the other hand , analysts say full cabins with ten seats per row in existing 777s indicated that many passengers decided to narrow orders , which could be associated with cheaper fares .	-6.1390
“ Eighteen inches of seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is governed by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , an expert for cabin equipment , founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network .	-4.6770
Airbus and Boeing offer no seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .	-2.6219
The world passenger jet-sellers even carry tape measurements to measure the equipment during the competition .	-6.5906
Even if they are touting comfort , all manufacturers also offer jet 's with high-density design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-6.7131
Airbus offers a A350 with tens of seats , but it has not yet sold , according to its own statement .	-5.7507
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of making the cabins more adaptable and offering large seats on the corridors for some jets .	-4.7377
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard would probably be lost , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-5.0394
New Anti-nicotine vaccine could make smoking enjoyable .	-3.1237
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoof smoking fun .	-2.5346
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-2.4497
Prior to human testing , further trials are needed , which may take some years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-6.0755
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help once millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all available methods on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell said .	-5.7955
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed to include genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-2.6970
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a constant stream of antibodies .	-2.7638
Antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , thereby ensuring that a woman does not experience nicotine High .	-5.4262
In experiments , the mice that Nikotin received have retained their normal level of activity .	-5.6491
By contrast , mice without vaccination had taken a “ exit , ” researchers declared that the nicotine had reached their brain .	-5.3943
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine journal .	-2.2638
Previous tobacco vaccines lacked antibodies .	-3.3298
Vaccines had to be so often given to maintain antibody levels that they were expensive and impractical .	-4.0902
But the cost of the new vaccine is likely to be significantly lower , as it turns liver cells into antibody factories .	-3.5833
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is safe , could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus avoid nicotine addiction .	-4.8231
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-2.0461
“ You then know : When they start to smoke again , they no longer feel a pleasure because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to place the habit , ” he explains .	-5.4990
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but warned at the same time that further research was needed .	-3.2182
Tribodi denies to have been influenced by Obeid .	-2.5950
Against former Labor-Party Minister Joe Tribodi of New South Wales , the government ’ s supervision of corruption is being investigated .	-6.7763
The former NSW Minister denies that the maritime settlement rules have changed at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had hidden holdings in three lands controlled by the state .	-6.2301
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its studies on the question of whether Obeid has influenced various ministers of state to extend lease contracts in the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a cafe , without calling for tender after they expire in August 2005 .	-7.4585
Now it is due to the accusation that Tripoli was aware of the hidden interest in property by Obeids , after the announcement of Tripoli 's former deputy head , Lynne Ashpole , on Thursday .	-9.3506
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tendering for lease contracts .	-3.4652
The tenants were opposed to this and also wanted longer periods .	-4.1532
In 2009 , the lease contracts for companies at the Circular Quay , which brought the Obeids into USD 2.5 million per year , were extended without public tender .	-4.0116
Tribati , who was a port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally called for public tenders .	-5.0568
But he declined to make the amendments to Obeid ’ s plea , which , as Tribati confirmed , had pressed for a government reformation of the Pachtrebles .	-7.3680
A telephone note submitted to the ICAC showed talks from August to September 2007 between Obeid , Tripoli and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Agency .	-6.6292
“ Was the subject discussed in these telephone talks the preparation of commercial compensation rules ? ” the deputy Commissioner , Anthony Whealy Tribodi , asked .	-7.4966
“ No , ” Tribodi replied .	-2.5866
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-2.2833
Definitely not between me and Mr Obeid .	-1.6130
Israeli warplanes target Syria , so official sources	-2.9637
Israel ’ s fighter jets had attacked Thursday ’ s target in the Syrian port of Latakia , confirmed a senior government official on Fox News .	-6.0240
The official did not explain what the target was , but said it was at least one .	-3.8714
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125-missiles .	-2.3177
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out air strikes on missile supplies in Syria .	-2.8431
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subject to “ authenticity test ”	-3.2036
The government is thinking about a “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of expanded measures .	-5.1184
If the test is introduced , it would be used as a criterion to prevent 457 from being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for bringing family and friends to Australia .	-5.4092
Today , a proposal for discussion has been published by the government after the previous members of the lab party , Maxine McKew , condemned the government 's comments on foreign workers , because they could be perceived as an insult by Australia 's neighbours .	-6.8331
“ Prompt explanations such as that foreigners should backfire , and that Australians first stop <unk> are a very unpleasant retreat in times when unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she told Australia India Institute today .	-6.6883
Historically , it was said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region were to hear an echo of this historical artifact , I would not be surprised .	-4.7271
The proposal for discussion is surrounded by twelve measures that were once thought up by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-4.7613
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was discussing human trafficking in Sri Lanka yesterday , has implemented five of the recommended changes , and the others are still being considered .	-3.6428
If the “ principle criterion ” is adopted , someone who is requesting a visa could be checked to see whether “ the application is authentic in cases where the applicant is related or personally connected to the owner or relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-7.2722
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have stopped hundreds .	-5.1333
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum probably died from a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island .	-4.3643
The disturbing nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him has been cared for by an adult cousin who was also on board since his father died on Wednesday .	-5.3009
Australian authorities brought the man into the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.9273
The British Government has announced a study aimed at increasing the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-3.3531
HSV Ltd 's work proposes that high-speed rail links between Scotland and the north of England should be implemented as early as phase 1 in 2026 .	-5.6575
Minister of Transport , Baroness Kramer , said that the project ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’ . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.7781
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-3.1811
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-2.0329
After Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-1.9048
In June , the government adjusted the estimated cost of building the high-speed train between London and the north of England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-5.7987
The British Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has mandated H02 Ltd to seek further capacity and travel improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-5.0409
This includes the possibility of a journey from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London , which is ultimately three hours or less .	-4.9694
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HSV is a truly national network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-3.6151
We are progressing with HSV because it brings enormous benefits .	-3.3719
Without it , we are facing a crisis of capacity in our rail network .	-2.8290
But it is also a question of linking 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.5966
The Scottish State Secretary Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.2944
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” support for Scottish inclusion in the HSB network .	-4.9018
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link has the potential of huge economic benefits for Scotland , while Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for fast rail links across the UK . ”	-4.9966
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for a high-speed rail rail rail link in Scotland , which will bring benefits for all and will complement the Glasgow Government , which is already planning .	-8.1416
I look forward to examining the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to taking the next steps together .	-4.9828
Provisions on electronic equipment in aircraft remain in force in Australia for the time being .	-2.2836
Australian air passengers must continue to turn off Tablet and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax the rules for such devices .	-5.2838
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read , watch , or play on their devices during critical flight phases of e-Books , as long as they are in “ air mode . ”	-5.4705
While most of the flight is already allowed , passengers find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when they start and landing .	-5.5391
Australian companies are not following the decision that US airlines will have to carry out vast amounts of work , but they are not pursuing any immediate plans to amend their regulations .	-6.4155
CASA has also stated that the announcement will be viewed , but stressed that restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia remain in force .	-6.0887
“ At present , CASA has no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on the aircraft , ” was announced .	-4.4115
The subject is subject to provisions requiring airlines to maintain safety at any time and passengers to comply with the safety instructions provided by cabin crews .	-4.8693
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA about extending the use of his Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and has said that it is open to change , but they should be initiated by the legislator .	-6.2711
“ We would like to see a review of the licensing of electronic devices by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-5.1911
Qantas stated that the current rules will remain in place until further notice .	-5.0358
“ Our current directives stipulate that electronic equipment must not be used at startup and landing , and we do not currently have plans to change that , ” said the company .	-4.8771
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.3162
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers , and we will certainly look carefully at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-4.9142
The decision has different implications for US companies depending on the age of the fleet .	-3.4135
They must demonstrate that their aircraft can tolerate mobile devices ’ wireless disruptions and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programmes and customer documentation .	-4.8048
“ Once an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , light electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-4.5075
In rare cases , on poor visibility , the crew will guide passengers while landing the equipment will be switched off .	-6.1374
The group also recommended that heavier equipment be safely evacuated under the seat or in compartments over the seats at startup and landing .	-5.7891
In front of the remasterby against Schalke , BVB fans had provided ugly scenes in the Veltins-Arena .	-6.5059
Borussia Dortmund announced that it would have had some hard consequences .	-4.9670
The Ultras responded with a silence before the Bundesliga Friday match against the VfB Stuttgart .	-3.5173
It was an unusual , almost playful acoustics , which offered to the viewer in the signal Iduna Park just before the whistle of the federal league between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart .	-6.5272
Most of the visitors were heard with their singing .	-4.3369
The southern gallery , on the other hand , where the most faithful and fair fans are , first presented in an exceptionally quiet setting : none of the songs , no raids .	-7.9567
The podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint fire , remained unchanged .	-3.2904
And right at the front of the grandstand , a big flag with the inscription " Stadium Banner " .	-8.0289
Only as Torhütter Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player , fired short-term cheers .	-5.4436
When his team members followed , there were vocal and rocking scarves - but not everywhere .	-4.9759
There was nothing in the central blocks of 12 and 13 of the southern gallery .	-3.1455
Also that Stadionpreacher Norbert Dickel once again recorded the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbyvictory , victory over Arsenal , extension of the contract by trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not create a ceremony .	-6.3579
Just five minutes before the whistle , the Capo ’ s podium – and that until then , with a hand of tangible strain , was invited in a loud cry , as thick as usual , to cast the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-9.3765
The last one was , as always , the South Trigallery in the row - and finally , as usual , the most fair place in the stadium .	-7.7217
And , at the latest , when the whistle from the South Trigallery came up with a resounding call for " Derbyquiger " , everything was as usual .	-8.0841
The previous silence was probably a response to the events of recent days .	-3.1278
Right before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the participating BVB fans had entered the audience and moved on to the place - hit almost goalkeeper Roman Weidenfeller .	-9.9935
The game was delayed due to the chaotic scenes .	-1.5806
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke then received the tips of the Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzkes 's words , this was a rather unpleasant date for the supporters .	-5.4057
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " said the BVB boss on Thursday evening at a podium discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.7188
As an immediate measure , Watzke banned the Ultras a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-4.5330
" I forbidden this , " he explained .	-2.5457
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy in pyrotechnics .	-1.6081
Moreover , the Ultras have been shown a variety of ways of punishing them - until Tuesday , they now have time to choose one .	-6.8112
Otherwise , Watzke says , the BVB will set a penalty by the end of next week .	-4.8763
" This becomes drastic " , says Watzke .	-3.4189
One can be curious how the reactions in the South gallery are .	-4.6484
Deposit houses are panning in Singapore , as the crisis has hit the middle class .	-4.3360
In a deposit house at Bendemeer Shopping Centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga trades a golden arm ripe , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of their daughters .	-4.4693
" My husband and I have just bought a house because my money is in it , " says Amirthalinga .	-4.5380
Although they earn $ 3,000 ( about $ 1.730 ) every month as an administrative co-worker and work their husband , they do not provide monthly family income , explains them .	-7.6630
Indeed , in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – demand is so large that ValuMax , where she made her exchange , became the third deposit house listed on the Singapuria Stock Exchange this week .	-5.3804
The food of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – 1,300 Singapore dollars in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-3.8582
Typically , deposit houses in Singapore require an effective 17 % annual interest rate , close to the 15.4 % required by the United OverSeas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-5.3505
However , deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need to review credit ratings or income records here , which is why loans are faster than they are possible for banks .	-7.0747
That is why millions of people in the region resort to collateral houses after families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-5.2907
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit due to a loose fiscal policy in developed economies , families with lower- and middle-income homes are seeking to offset the difference in the stowed economy .	-5.6114
This week , the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing household debt , mainly through rising mortgages , called a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.3142
According to the Agency ’ s assessment , Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore have the highest household debt in Asia relative to gross domestic product .	-7.5899
Malaysia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of GDP , a 60 % increase in 2008 .	-3.5269
Popular economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week has just come out of a technical recession .	-4.5341
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing decline in exports and a drop in consumer demand .	-2.8518
“ In effect , with costs rising , people in the middle to lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Woh , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.7678
Historic highs at gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal items , as people take the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-5.4523

The company finances the $ 66 million Singapore stock exchange this week with 60 % of the $ 66 million .	-4.7801
While some lenders have been put on fire for high interest rates , Yeah explains that deposit houses are not only yielding more interest than others , but also not directly raising the debt .	-6.7371
“ Customers are insulting items they already own , and the fluid of personal assets does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-5.5912
The deposit lending business is increasingly accepted as short-term , secured financing .	-2.9418

Rescue package of over 325 million Australian dollars for Tasman Health .	-5.3452

Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic disease and system restrictions .	-4.2623
The funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with an independent tacean MEP Andrew Wilkie .	-5.5865
“ The government has created an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” explains Plibersek today .	-4.6915
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million in emergency aid for electoral services .	-3.2235
Another 2600 operations , including orthopedic procedures and treatments for grey star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-5.7822
In addition , there is money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better aftercare after in-patient stays , specialist exchanges , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronically recording health data in local hospitals .	-5.9259
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected clinicians have told me that they are the best way to improve Tasman ’ s health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-4.5964
The Minister insisted on strict reporting and accountability of the Tasman Government .	-2.8188
The federal state must maintain the current level of financing in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where the extra money has been spent .	-4.6831
A three-headed Commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.3562
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they are not accompanied by real reforms that will put the public Taymanian health system on a more sustainable path . ”	-4.9292
Despite this , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent assistance , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .	-3.6975
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to taking the state ’ s public health system from the custody list , ” said Wilkie .	-4.4010
According to the federal government , these electoral benefits will largely offset recent cuts .	-2.9029
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ paving solution . ”	-3.3830
“ We are in a position today because the lab government has left $ 430 million out of the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.5060
It cannot be that a state government is throwing almost half a billion dollars out of the system , throwing 300 million into the Commonwealth , then doing as if good news .	-6.5853

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , a monitoring group	-3.0643
Syria has destroyed important facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons and gas ammunition , and the global chemical weapons monitoring group declared on Thursday , while there were serious clashes in the north of the country near one of the sites where suspected toxic substances are stored .	-7.1327
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of the civil war just three years ago .	-3.2133
The announcement by the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline .	-3.4197
1 November , which the Hague based organization had set in Damascus to destroy or make “ inoperable ” all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons , including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling in ammunition .	-5.9042
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.2538
The destruction of institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.0899
Damascus , however , must begin to destroy the existing weapons and stocks .	-3.3328
It is estimated that there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and Sarin .	-3.6572
The announcement came at a time when , on Thursday , battles took place in the city of Safira , experts said that there was a chemical weapons production facility and storage facilities , as announced by the United Kingdom Syrian Human Rights Observatory .	-5.4673
The active group that follows the number of deaths over a network of activists in Syria declared on Thursday that 120.296 people died .	-4.2038
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6.365 children .	-5.6864
On the government side , 29.954 of them belong to the army of President Bashar Assad , and 18.678 are pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militia .	-4.7248
Also among the dead are 2,202 desertified army soldiers and 5,375 combatants of the opposition , many of them foreigners .	-4.8159
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-2.1258
This number has not been updated .	-1.5716
The conflict has forced about two million people to flee the country .	-1.5456
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels for weeks in Safira , many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-2.7473
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-3.0123
The battles highlight the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.7292
According to the OPCW , which is working closely with the United Nations , “ the team now believes that it has seen and experienced its destruction all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-5.5301
Therefore , “ no further inspection activities are currently planned . ”	-2.9066
At the beginning of the week , inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites listed by Damascus .	-4.0394
Due to security concerns , it was not possible to visit two institutions , the inspectors said .	-3.4108
On Thursday , the OPWC declared that the two sites were “ abandoned ” according to the Syrian statement ... and the objects in the chemical weapons program there were transferred to other institutions that were inspected . ”	-6.4205
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-2.9506
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , to be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month .	-3.1118
" I salute the bravery and courage you have all shown when you complete the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , " said Ahmed Uzucu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organisation in a commentary published by OPCW .	-6.4499
For three years now , the majority of Sunni Muslim families in this civil war have been fighting Assad ’ s government and its security forces , which are members of the Alawites , have been fighting a secession of Shia Islam .	-5.0377

Wrath of Bali ’ s Bombardier	-3.2764
The survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died during the Bali bombings in 2002 responded with anger at the judgment of the last of the instigators who was brought to trial , as Umar Patek , she believed , should be shot dead by law .	-9.5523
Patek , who was almost ten years on the run as one of the most sought people in Southeast Asia , was sentenced yesterday to a 20 year prison sentence for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack .	-6.0832
He could be released after 15 years of prison .	-2.9838
The 45-year-old was guilty of mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.9798
A condemnation also took place in a number of terrorist charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Christmas Eve in 2000 .	-4.5514
The Public Prosecutor had called for a life sentence , even if she could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a masterly bomb builder , has also been called a ' Demolition Man ' .	-6.7354
The decision raised painful memories in June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39 years old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators nearly ten years ago .	-4.6858
With tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.0422
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-2.1881
" You should put him in front of a suspension command , " Correen said to AAP .	-5.2771
I have to live every day with the fact that I am not going to get any more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters anymore .	-4.4430

He fell into coma for a month after the attack and “ died ” three times , while he depended on a life-preservation system .	-5.3046
Mr Hughes said that Patek deserves the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell , Jemaah Isimah – Amrozi , Mukhlis and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-5.5734
Indeed , this type should be given the death penalty above all .	-3.1851

Patek is the last of the Bali Bomber to be tried .	-2.6433
He took almost a decade of arrest , but was finally taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottad in January 2011 , where US forces killed Osama bin Laden just four months later .	-3.9960
During the negotiations , a FBI-agent said that intelligence reports indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-4.9878
“ He didn ’ t stand , ” said Corteeen .	-3.5381
Until recently , he has shown no remorse for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-3.5480
The verdict came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which will be commemorated in Bali and Australia .	-3.9293
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-2.0757
Patek may appeal against his judgment .	-1.7506
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment on aircraft ( but do not have mobile phone calls ) .	-4.0408
Air passengers can now use their electronic devices to read , work , play , listen to music and call the image of films , but not phone phones , so the new guidelines issued on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the US .	-6.6899
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.5977
As soon as they are implemented , the airline concerned is leaving , FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference .	-6.7797
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the flight crew and the rules on equipment handling in accordance with the new regulations .	-6.7065
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to increase the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft .	-4.5775
These airlines also included Delta and JetBlue .	-2.5213
“ Depending on the state of the plan we could approve the extended use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-4.4099
At present , passengers must turn off smart phones , tablets , and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.4862
You will not be allowed to start again until the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain will give the green light .	-5.0596
When entering the landing flight , passengers must turn off and not start again until the plane has landed .	-6.1515
Under the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are safe from electronic disturbances could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at launch , landing and landing , as stated by the FAA .	-6.6190
The majority of new commercial aircraft and other aircraft that have been upgraded to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria . , , , and .	-6.0052
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Flight Attendant Association , welcomed the changes .	-3.8224
“ If the new regime is implemented safely – and we are working closely with the airline on this – both sides will benefit from it , ” commented Glading .	-4.4952
We are frankly sorry to have to feel like an intruder on this issue .	-4.2517
Nevertheless , Internet connections for surfing , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .	-4.9966
Passengers are asked to move smart phones , tablets , and other devices into airmode .	-4.8478
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble related online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave an American Airlines jet in the public because he refused to switch off the device while the plane was on the plane .	-5.4528
And heavier equipment such as laptops must continue to be damaged , as there is a risk of injury here if they fly through the cabin .	-4.6073
Mobile talks during the flight remain banned as well .	-3.4600
The regulatory competence for telephone conversations lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-2.1355
FAA may lift certain electronic equipment from start and landing .	-3.6344
Last month , Mark Rosenker , from the National Transportation Safety Board , security expert on national transport issues at CBS News , mobile phones were still viewed as a risk .	-4.0432
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause disruption in navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that the transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission masts , ” says Rosenker .	-5.2876
A branch advisory committee , launched by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government authorise a broader use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.3769
In recent years , pressure has increased on the FAA to ease restrictions on its use .	-3.0788
Critics such as the Democratic senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri argue that there are no valid grounds for prohibition .	-3.7885
The restrictions are also becoming increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-4.2485
Some studies mention that up to a third of passengers forget or ignore the device 's switchover .	-9.3846
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air passengers after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment by passengers had become known as FM radio , which was the latest technology trend at that time .	-6.3964
New aircraft are far more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA that they do not require any electronic interference .	-4.2015
Airlines have been providing passengers with Wi-Fi for a number of years now when they reach the airport .	-6.4341
The planes fitted with Wi-Fi systems are also more sensitive to interferences .	-4.5096
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment in accordance with the new directives , Mr Huerta said .	-4.2001
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally emits much less radiation than previous generations .	-2.8169
For example , e-readers only display minimal radiation when bluffing .	-4.4279
However , when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.7271
One of the advocates of relaxation of restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers is Amazon.com.	-3.9039
In 2011 , the company ’ s staff opened a passenger airplane full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems , but couldn ’ t find them .	-7.0995
Members of the FAA Advisory Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-2.2404
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passenger said that he believed that the disruption caused by the equipment is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-5.0107
Other committee members said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who are in charge of disruption of aircraft systems through the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-4.9075
However , the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for passenger disconnection of the equipment in poor visibility conditions .	-6.4295
A group in the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a sensible adjustment for travellers , who would today be extensively equipped with technology .	-4.8767
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with safety , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.7153
Redeemed bird rescued by air rescue service from North Sea drilling .	-4.5712
A bird caught by air rescue service on the coast , which had been found exhausted on a North Sea drilling , has been released back into nature .	-6.5818
The Wasserralle was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , which was towed by the Scottish Animal Welfare Organization ( SPCA ) in their rescue centre in Alloa .	-6.6343
Colin Sedcon , head of the center , said : “ This water orbits was probably a winter train bird from Northern Europe , stopped by the strong winds over the North Sea . ”	-6.5347
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-2.4755
He added : “ He could no longer fly and so we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-4.1214
When she was released , the water orbits was again fit and healthy .	-3.3765
Is Europe ’ s elite willing to do business with Britain ?	-1.6125
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention to bring the economy to a table and define what those in Britain want to change to our relations with the EU .	-4.6033
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey of British business leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-3.6745
YouGov surveyed more than 1,000 business executives , accounting for roughly the UK size , sectors , and regions .	-4.3026
Many will be surprised by the results of the poll .	-5.2122
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe and are concentrated on countries that are modernising and growing , while EU states are stagnating .	-4.6066
They want governments to favor new trade links with countries such as China , India , and Brazil , rather than stop the long and exhausting process of reforming obscure EU institutions .	-4.7223
In her view , the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be returned to Westminster .	-4.7246
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies agreed that they are traditionally most pro-European .	-5.6337
Finally , and probably most importantly , our survey of economic leaders found that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade was not based on politics .	-5.6294
This insight , found in companies of all sizes and leading concerns , shows that the economy is pressing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the business back to Britain .	-5.9896
It is a lot – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of keeping the EU in a referendum .	-5.6715
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership .	-3.6583
It also shows that companies expect a renegotiation of power back to Britain .	-3.0770
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone is moving toward a closer economic and fiscal union .	-3.1613
The priority must be jobs and growth in the UK , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to rules .	-4.5882
Gazprom ’ s Alexei Miller calls the pipeline in Bulgaria to be the beginning of a new gas era .	-7.4552
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria marks the start of one of the largest European energy projects , as the Gazprom Executive Board explained .	-3.5492
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said Gazprom ’ s CEO , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.6186
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire continent of Europe .	-2.1321
South Stream is intended to increase the diversity of Russia 's export routes through Europe .	-3.0201
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where the bulk of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , provides for increased risk of conventional routes , as is official .	-5.6050
Miller said that direct connections to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , mean that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ forever ” .	-3.1178
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at special rates when the whole project is in operation in 2015 .	-3.8331
According to Gazprom , construction works are to start in other downstream countries on the planned route to the end of the year .	-3.0779
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-2.5409

Germany ’ s real estate markets are benefiting from economic strength and the favourable economic conditions in the country compared to Europe .	-4.9093
Christian Ulbrich , CEO of Europe , Middle East and Africa by Jones Lang LaSalle , referred to the 9th real estate day of the stock market newspaper .	-3.8796
How to look for German commercial real estate displays the transaction volume , so Ulbrich .	-4.8765
In the first three quarters of this year , the figure was 31 % compared to last year .	-3.2862
In the UK , the plus was only 6 % , and in France 19 % .	-3.6180
" Real estate investments offer an attractive interest , " said Ulbrich .	-1.8068
The yield gap between real estate and federal bonds is at an historically high level .	-2.3296
The FAA will block restrictions on the use of electronic equipment on aircraft , even if mobile telephony remains prohibited .	-5.2140

Hearing at the Royal Commission : Two YMCA employees face charges against Jonathan Lord for sex crimes .	-4.7316
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were charged with sex crimes associated with children before they were charged in 2011 to the child care Jonathan Lord of Caringbah , as the Royal Commission learned about the sexual abuse of children .	-6.5966
But at the opening statement before the Commission , the YMCA said that “ the organization never had any sexual abuse ” .	-6.2994
Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of committing child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher at YMCA Caringbah Hall was convicted in 1991 of abuse of familiar children .	-5.5272
Hare said Gail Furness , a lawyer assisted by the Commission , that he knew from the first case but did not know the second .	-4.0132
He acknowledged that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that ‘ there have been external review of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as at the forefront of child safety ’ .	-5.6718
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest rating of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-4.1880
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the management of the company failed “ from me to go down ” to the Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the Children ’ s Safety Guidelines .	-7.5323
Lord had been sentenced to the YMCA at the beginning of the year for sexual offences against twelve boys during his two-year activities .	-5.3015
He has been sentenced to at least six years of prison .	-5.1163
Hare argued , however , that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented the employee from reporting breaches of children 's safety .	-6.7463
The staff said that they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , privately held them as a babysitter , sitting on his lap , said that he loved it , and allowed children to play with his mobile .	-7.6886
Danielle Ockwell , whose former Lord was and who had asked for a training to protect children because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service leader Jacqui Barnat , who was the lead officer in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidated and most of the time was very inept . ”	-8.4233
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to report back to their executive .	-4.8574
Instead , he said , their friendship with Lord had impaired their judgment , which is why they had not reported him .	-4.8495
Hare explained that he told the board of the YMCA NSW his view that the lesson that the organization had to draw from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” was “ not the registered ” by employees , and the Board of Directors agreed to him .	-7.2210
Hare said that the decision to urge staff to sign confidentiality obligations soon after allegations occurred was taken by the director of YMCA 's children 's services , Liam Whitley .	-5.1261
He said that this should prevent the contamination of the evidence , but that was ‘ overzealous ’ and misimplemented .	-4.3984
YMCA NSW was not a safe organisation for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was there between 2009 and 2011 , explained Professor Stephen Smallbone from Griffith University , an expert on sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-4.1960
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , review , investigation , training , and supervision of employees .	-3.6236
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.7382
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister , but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-3.1593
In an interview tonight on the fifth anniversary of his dismissal , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.1376
Ever since he resigned in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided commenting on British policy , and his comments have largely been confined to foreign policy and to his role as envoy of the Middle East Peace Founders ’ Quartet .	-6.8110
When asked whether he would like to return to the post of Prime Minister , Blair was quoted by the Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that this happens , so ... ”	-5.6503
When the horse foals arrived in droves in Cardiff to pick the horse of the year , they knew that a hard competition was imminent .	-6.1262
However , none of the Fenton Kirto was prepared on the three years old .	-5.1897
The Knirps , which is not even in the kindergarten and only a few months ago has taken his first steps , and his Shetland Pony Toffee fought comfortably through the three rounds and won the first prize – leaving behind 30 adult opponents .	-7.0669
The unbroken couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behavior , and style in the annual competition organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudryy near Cardiff .	-5.8571
During his performance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had set up his leghold trap in a free-angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-5.9024
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural abilities in dealing with the pony , which stretched far beyond his age .	-3.9006
And Toffee received best marks for his appearance and personality .	-3.4988
Fenton had been given a gift last March for his third birthday and since then every day with the Shetland Pony .	-8.8425
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great listener . ”	-2.0907
They had to compete against the entire course and took off with Goldpokal and Rosette .	-5.7297
It was only the second time he took part in a competition with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.9367
Complete strangers in the arena thought he was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-3.3524
The little boy from the village Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his tandem Sharon Howell , who has been showing horses for over ten years .	-4.7548
Howells told : “ The whole audience was as excited and everyone shot and kicked it . ”	-6.7877
He ran on sand the entire length of the arena and , although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-4.3593
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to take care of .	-2.8599
As it is started , it will not take long for it to be on the “ horse of the year ” tsu – and I am sure it will do well .	-5.2253
One speaker of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.9623
Together they are a great team .	-2.1715
Fenton and Toffee judged how well they had beaten and presented in the demonstration ring .	-3.4003
They care for good cooperation between pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best at the ring .	-4.3214
I am sure Fenton ’ s sweet dress did its part to make it a perfect occasion .	-5.8338
The Chinese Newspaper ’ s Call for Reform	-2.9990
A Chinese newspaper calling for the release of a reporter accused of defamation to be reformed on the front page said a press regulator .	-4.0507
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.3010
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a convicted company .	-3.6695
Now , the New Express is being subjected to a “ comprehensive re-injection , ” said the regulatory authority .	-5.3140
The “ reclassification order ” came from the Agency for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-3.6091
Preliminary investigations revealed that , between September 2012 and August 2013 , the New Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had released several inaccurate reports on the publicly traded company Zolion .	-4.7327
“ The New Express editorial management was disordered , ” said the regulatory authority in a statement .	-4.5320
She said that he decided to “ impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and remove his story . ”	-4.1114
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to implement a complete reclamation of the New Express and recommended that those responsible for the New Express should be identified and that the New Express leadership team should immediately be reviewed . ”	-8.3678
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zolion .	-3.6994
After he was arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and was behind his journalistic work .	-2.9917
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment .	-4.2964
“ In this case , I damaged Zolion , as did the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he explained to the CCTV public .	-4.2666
I did it primarily because I was on money and glory .	-3.3796
I realise that I have acted badly .	-4.4201
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express issued an apology on the front page , saying that one failed to check the reports correctly .	-3.9915
Several well-known suspects have recently been on television in confessions .	-3.8003
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a legislative change early this year , in which the authorities were prohibited from forcing someone to accuse themselves .	-4.5198
Drugs tunnel discovered with its own rail network between the United States and Mexico	-3.9004
One of the most sophisticated tunnel for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , which was completely equipped with lighting , ventilation and electrical railway operations , has now been discovered .	-4.8327
The US authorities described the 120 cm tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .	-3.7550
The tunnel , which runs in the Zickzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-4.2079
In the area there are countless inconspicuous warehouses , which makes it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs .	-5.6020
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be safely transported , the authorities explained .	-3.9876
During the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were guaranteed , according to the Court 's record .	-4.7015
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged with the ownership and the intended sale of Marijuana and cocaine .	-4.2095
They threaten prison sentences between ten years and for life if they are guilty .	-4.4458
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of drainage channels .	-3.1606
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered since 2006 in San Diego .	-2.4460
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico in October after the Marijuana harvest , which presents the drug cartels with the challenge of rapidly bringing their product to consumers .	-5.0769
In 2010 , authorities found a passage of about 640 metres long , which ran from a kitchen in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-4.5335
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love .	-1.3395
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.5807
In an interview , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-2.5575
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of 2 years Flynn .	-2.6906
Orlando Bloom has spoken about separating his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-4.0573
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , which should be broadcast on Friday ( Local Time ) , Bloom said , " Life is sometimes not exactly the way we plan or hope it " .	-4.5365
Kerr and he still loved himself , stressed the 36-year-old .	-2.8074
" We will support each other and love Flynn as a parent .	-3.7602
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , in 2011 their sons Flynn was born .	-2.7228
Veganism , according to Lexika , is subordinate to vegetarianism , but differs greatly from it .	-4.5044
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream , ice or a strong Edam , these feasts are not on the menu of a vegan .	-5.1637
Milk , cheese , egg , besides giving up meat and fish , the vegan leaves all meat and vegetables - honey is denied .	-6.3938
What remains , one might ask , but on closer inspection , the vegan food world is characterised with a considerable ingenuity .	-5.6595
" Brodovfstriche are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , which has a variety of special products for vegans .	-3.9949
Reuben Proctor is happy to visit the shop at Domgasse .	-3.7658
For 13 years , the native New Zealand vegan lives , in Lamperheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I introduced my diet and became vegetarian " .	-5.3193
At the turn of the century was the next step and I became a vegan .	-2.2339
" But the conviction came not only because of nutrition , but because of the choice of shoes , " Proctor , who prefers artificial leather ordinary leather .	-6.7419
He recognized that other everyday concerns do not include animal products .	-4.0479
First of all , vegan is an ethics .	-2.0394
" I do not want animals to die for me " , Proctor explains the maxim of vegans , which covers all consumption patterns .	-4.6355
Instead of staunchs , crickers , or rubber balls behind , the vegan quickly discovered new products that increased enthusiasm .	-7.7152
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " in fact , vegan does not constitute a waiver , it is an enrichment " .	-6.5294
And it was precisely these conditions that caused some attempts to fail .	-6.1862
" The addiction factor is a crucial factor that allows many to quit quickly , similar to smoking , " Promtor sets a comparison .	-5.7003
And put it : ' Certain tastes are not fixed on the pet ' .	-5.0652
It is often the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-5.6847
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " clarifies the vegan .	-3.3851
For example , Proctor brings Aubergins , Champignons and also a few vegans .	-5.5661
It pays attention to a balanced , diversified diet , where it should taste properly .	-5.6349
Of course , one wants to be between teeth , that is legitimate .	-4.0001
" It is to taste , but that is not just to reduce it to animal food , " said Proctor .	-4.6210
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , has not been sustained .	-3.7857
For me , the change had a positive aspect .	-3.0612
I do not take up any foreign cholesterol and have an increased proportion of vitamins .	-4.0893
There are high performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan .	-3.0909
" My blood values are very good , I often check myself , " explains Proctor .	-5.1696
In particular , before the lack of vitamin B12 , many Vegan critics warn .	-3.0403
" Since animals are fed with feed instead of graying on the wheat , it is doubtful whether in the meat you buy in the refrigerator the vitamin B12 percentage is high " , Proctor finds .	-5.7447
For vegans , it is also possible to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.4432
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-1.6451
Proctor must not go far in terms of food supply .	-4.2666
After all , basic foodstuffs exist everywhere and every supermarket has soya milk and other products .	-4.4014
All I need can find on the spot .	-3.4403
I only buy from time to time something special .	-3.9165
" Many people overlook that just finished products are expensive , but this is how " ordinary " finished products are notoriously " .	-4.3496
At any rate , the preparation of vegan dishes would be much cheaper and less time-consuming than was generally assumed .	-3.6417
" There is a lot to discover in the kitchen , with a few small knuckles you can achieve good , if not partly better results " , says Proctor .	-5.3463
margarine instead of butter , a little more powdered and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring his sweating eggs to a jam .	-6.3195
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spice .	-3.7097
The momentum of cooking together has a new role to play .	-4.8843
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves " says Proctor .	-3.6237
Of course , he was also skeptical .	-3.0247
Does my meal no longer bite ?	-3.8243
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - you have to act as a vegan with a sense of touch .	-6.2247
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society " , Proctor does not want an enclave period .	-4.8503
And , more accurately , the everyday world does not seem as alien as it is believed - and the vegan does not restrict it as in everyday life as commonly assumed .	-7.7508
Fast food is also allowed .	-1.5539
Pommes are everywhere !	-3.5814
" Many frog sliders offer falafel , or even a vegetarian Yufka " , says Proctor .	-5.1699
In a pizzeria he likes to cook or order a pizza without cheese , all a question of habit .	-5.1538
Restaurants are so slow to find their way around .	-4.4728
" When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult " , New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to people , draw them to the attention " .	-5.5596
" If there is enough demand , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , " he hopes .	-3.2473
Vegane restaurants develop , such as the Kombüse in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei .	-4.2149
Proctor has a wish that other restaurants at least have a vegan meal on the menu .	-3.6121
Essentially , vegan dishes are available for everyone .	-2.8856
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.2707
" Meat courts are , however , exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others " , Proctor notes .	-5.4567
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the most of the ingredients impossible , " says Proctor .	-4.9832
However , purchasing vegan products could be rather difficult at the beginning .	-3.4892
In particular , if you learn to understand what is also possible in earth ’ s animal additives as a color donor , you seem to be leaving the courage to follow ethics on so many hurdles and traps quickly .	-7.1832
Not only for this reason , Reubben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added to food and also cleaning products .	-4.7642
" After and after , you develop a scanner vision and know which characters and logos you have to respect " It is sometimes better to do small steps than to close or stumble " , Protor knows .	-8.0381
Veganism , it is an important moral pointer that draws attention to awareness .	-4.9743
Perhaps he does not manage to deflect his habits , but at least he can teach consumers critically to question his habits .	-4.0140
The trading operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in .	-3.3156
The trading at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time .	-3.1962
In a communication the operator made technical problems responsible .	-2.3335
The other eleven US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unimpeded . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.9322
The latest incident continues a series of smaller and larger mishaps among the stock market operator .	-4.0650
It was only on Tuesday that the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour because of data transfer errors .	-3.4607
In August of this year alone there were two mishaps in a week .	-2.9970
First of all , the US investment bank Goldman Sachs had sent a large number of defective purchases to the option markets due to technical problems .	-6.3066
As a result , stock market operators needed almost a whole day to view and cancel their orders .	-3.8202
Two days later , half of the total share trade in the US came to a halt for several hours because of a computer panic at the Nasdaq stock exchange .	-4.9303
The last year saw a stir in Facebook ’ s stock exchange .	-4.9000
Nasdaq systems were not up to the flood of sales and sales orders , later found the SEC , and merged the company into a record fine of $ 10 million .	-6.5711

Assange is a British police officer who has signed an extradition certificate .	-6.2914
The British police have today handed over an extradition document to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who has sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-3.9498
Scotland Yard explained that 40-year-old Australians were “ invited to stand , ” which asked him to appear in a police station , and added , should he not attend , he would be subject to arrest .	-6.6402
Assange is threatening to extradite to Sweden for charges in a sex offence , after having exhausted its capabilities under British law since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition earlier this month .	-5.0720
As he fears that Stockholm will deliver him to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.8322
Scotland Yard “ sent a 40-year-old man an invitation to face a police station at a time we selected , ” said a speaker .	-5.2670
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .	-1.9244
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police invitation .	-3.3358
Assange fears that he will be extradited from Sweden to the United States , indicted for possible charges of espionage , after having published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the disclosures website of WikiLeaks .	-5.1820

Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintrace .	-3.7032
After the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage cups between his legs .	-2.8007
In front of the Colchester District Court , Howie was known to be guilty without the necessary care and attention .	-5.8627
He received seven points and a six-month ban on driving .	-3.0546
Howie was also sentenced to 90 <unk> and a victim contract of 100 <unk> .	-3.8983
Tax on foreign property owners against London ’ s Assault bubble	-3.3512
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne , who had imposed a 7 % stamp tax in the 2012 budget on homes that cost more than GBP 2 million , as well as annual charges for buyers holding houses as a company and not as individuals .	-7.4624
Already , revenue from the stamp of the home tax in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea district , which was <unk> 708 million in 2012 / 13 , is collected by the proceeds for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the northeast , northwest , Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-10.5596
Cook said : “ After the tax cuts on high-priced housing and the introduction of the associated legislation against a shift , it is hard to claim that high quality real estate is taxed too low , regardless of the effects of the obsolete community tax system . ”	-7.2789
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more reticent about buying property in London , or holding owners of it , ” he added .	-3.6455
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the afterprice housing market – in London ’ s wealthy southwest belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , paid off the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-5.2253
The prices in Central London accounted for an equal annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where the south-western part of the city , north ( 7.4 % ) , and East ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , according to a survey carried out by Savipol .	-7.5216
Scientists could shed more light on the extent to which the tail of a dog stands with its mood .	-3.5609
Previous research had shown that happy dogs with the tail were wearing more right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left side for nervous dogs .	-5.1798
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them .	-2.5956
Professor Georgio Vallortinia , a neuroscientist from the University of Trento , said : “ People know well that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that cause positive or negative emotions . ”	-4.9319
We have tried to look at this with other species .	-2.8688
He also noted that in dogs , as in humans , the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in emotions .	-4.1387
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral sweater of their loved ones , researchers watched the animals while those films of other dogs arrived .	-6.4842
They measure the heart rate of the four-legers and analyzed the behavior .	-4.6401
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-3.7473
Professor Vallornemia said : “ We have shown movies with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate stray other aspects , and we have been able to control the movement of the tail more to the left or right . ”	-7.8655
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressive dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the sleeping dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.2429
However , if the affection for the swans was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog , the wedelt ) , their heart rate rose and they looked uneasy .	-7.5077
According to Professor Vallornemia , dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-4.0988
He is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience about which movements they should worry about and when not .	-4.3361
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and if you ’ re looking at the cock in one direction , you ’ ll be more associated with friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior , then you ’ ll react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-8.9644
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners , veterinarians and trainers understand the emotions of their animals better .	-4.6554
John Bradshaw , an expert in dog behaviour and guest stipendiat the Faculty of Animal Health at the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study to investigate whether the left and right were important for dogs .	-5.0786
Last year , a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog and to the right when they are a satisfied dog .	-4.6822
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , the following was the following : “ Dogs go to a robot dog when his , tail <unk> left wedelt and not to be left instead of being unquiet – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-6.7130
According to his statement , the differences may stem from the fact that in the various studies , the dogs did not interpret the animals as dogs in the films or the robotic dogs .	-7.2280
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-1.7021
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brainboxes are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-4.2719
However , as their behaviour simply shows up , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-5.7884
Arctic Monkeys postponed appearance in Glasgow due to the Alex Turner disease	-3.8962
The rock band Arctic Monkeys moved a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer is ill with throat heartburn .	-5.4845
The band from Sheffield was supposed to play in the Hydro on Friday .	-2.9391
Because of the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner , the concert must now be moved .	-4.1490
The announcement of the band came after moving a performance in the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-3.6193
In a statement on its official website , the Arctic Monkeys shared : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening , and at medical advice the Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show at the Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , November 1 . ”	-14.9787
“ A throat inflammation was diagnosed with Alex Turner , which is why he cannot appear . ”	-4.1147

Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal in February	-1.8539
Pope Francis will be appointed for the first time on 22 February as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.3114
Pilots are the highest clergy in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-6.0283
At present there are 201 cardinal .	-3.3216
However , a Cardinal , who has reached an age of 80 , can no longer take part in the Papal election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinal . ”	-5.5046
In a statement in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman of the Vatican , said that there will be a meeting of all the cardinal forces before the ceremony of the appointment of the new cardinal , also known as the Congregation .	-5.5255
“ Pope Francis decided to advance his decision to call the council of the Constitution in February , so that other meetings that require the participation of cardinal from all over the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6058
Jack Valero of Catharic Voices said that the number of eligible cardinal would probably have declined by February .	-2.7248
He explained that a Pope would normally be as many cardinal as necessary , so that the number of cardinal entitled to vote again amounts to 120 , and so many cardinal duties over 80 , as he would like .	-7.8953
The council next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March this year , Valero says .	-3.5517
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , particularly Italy .	-3.0623
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinal from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.4545
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinal .	-1.6665
The cardinal ascents will also be the first to call the Council of cardinal agencies established since the formation of the Franciscan Council , a group of eight cardinal from around the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church .	-7.2507
In the past , the Pope chose everything alone .	-2.0545
“ Now Francis has selected these eight cardinal channels to help him , ” said Valero .	-3.0483
He explained that it was “ possible ” for Francis to ask for advice on the cardinal orders .	-4.9266
But we have not been in this situation so far – that is all very new .	-4.4505
Valero said that , typically , the bishops would be called to cardinal from large places , but Francis is “ filled with surprises – so we don ’ t know who to name . ”	-6.3681
GM calls new pick-up trucks in the US to repair the seat backrest .	-3.5879
General Motors calls for just under 19,000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado- and GMC Sierra Pickups , built in 2014 , to address a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , a communication from the US Automotive Safety Authority on Friday .	-7.0106
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for putting back the front seat backrest .	-3.2855
For this reason , they do not comply with the federal guidelines on vehicle safety at head restraints .	-3.8186
“ If you drive back to the vehicle , it is possible that the headrest does not properly protect the occupants so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the news on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-5.6242
The renovated models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-3.6921
The delivery of the GM-trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading American car manufacturer since the insolvent restructuring 2009 .	-5.5936
GM informed the car owner of the defect in the first Oktoberfest .	-4.5200
The NHTSA could not check the notification of the 16 day Government shutdown , which had negative impact on car sales in October .	-6.6092
The sale of the SilverFast and Sierra trucks , which were newly developed for the 2014 model year , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , GM announced on Friday .	-4.9569
In October GM 42.660 sold SilverFast and 16.503 Sieberra Pickups trucks .	-2.4158
GM shares increased by 1.4 percent on the New York Stock Exchange to 37.47 dollars on Friday afternoon .	-3.2270
Desperate a Obamanian Voter	-2.9725
I have twice elected President Obama in the hope that change is possible .	-2.6736
He says Obama has made laudable efforts to undermine the Republicans ’ blockades tactics .	-3.0527
The blockage policy does not excuse Obamacare ’ s website problems , drone attacks .	-2.9078
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign were a sad reminder of what would have been possible .	-1.9575
Nathalie P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-2.0910
I currently read a terribly sad book .	-1.7630
It is a book from which I believed I would be born during the deceitful second year of my medical student and give me hope again .	-6.2222
It is called “ The Audacity to Win , ” and depicts Barack Obama ’ s memoirs on the 2008 presidential election .	-3.8534
When I finish my patient records in the evening and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions and could take a breath of words .	-6.0937
The election became a landslide victory , and spokesman for news spoke to demonstrate the historic significance of this hour .	-5.0808
My classmates wept with joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-2.1360
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.1093
When Obama changed into office in 2008 , he had ratings of 82 % .	-2.8777
And then I finish the book .	-2.3967
Turning again to the present is a nasty awakening as if you are torn out of a dream .	-3.4536
It is hard to recall these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague reminder , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-4.3444
In the years since I first voted , something has actually changed .	-2.9215
But it is nothing I could have imagined .	-2.2400
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced disappearance of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-4.4610
I , too , believe that the party-political blocking tactics have taken away too many efforts to make our nation move forward : immigration reform , a public health insurance option and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-5.6274
But , having defended the Obama administration over and over again against colleagues and acquaintances , I have ended up with my attempt to explain .	-4.9216
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.1050
The Republican blockade policy cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to hear off or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-3.7008
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about Americans ’ private lives and why whistleblowers are punished for exposing public wrongdoing .	-3.6112
It is unacceptable to explain why Anwar al-Awlaiki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , and why public financing and spending limits are circumvented during the presidential election .	-4.5778
It does not justify the results of a report which states that the White House ’ s efforts to calm the media are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon administration . ”	-3.7996
And recent , it cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-4.2051
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected .	-1.7678
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict the previous political campaigns .	-3.8007
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and accidental events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-5.5387
But if I look at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.1173
And that bother me most .	-2.5152
I elected Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-2.3983
Mitt Romney was a confused and unequal alternative , and he seemed unable to set his direction and positions .	-4.1835
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free of pressure from future elections , would meet the hope that we had heard so long .	-3.7659
But , with Obama ’ s approval ratings falling below 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become so much harder by this book .	-4.3417
It strikes me as the longing for the many promises that have dissipated into air .	-4.3299
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to face a serious loss of Clinton in the pre-election in Pennsylvania .	-4.2362
In a meeting with the electoral heroes following the decision , he told his staff that they should come back on track and follow the purpose of their case .	-5.6452
“ I want us to find our magic , ” he said .	-2.2860
We must remember who we are .	-0.9207
It is five years later , Mr President , and I could not give you more support .	-2.5917

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has a conflict of interests on parental leave .	-1.5742
The billionaire and fellow Member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in conflict of interests in his plans for parental leave , because his daughters could become pregnant and therefore benefit from it .	-4.3916
The mining magnate , who is in a judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax , raised the claim that he wanted to wipe out questions as to whether he was in conflict .	-6.7392
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether to cut or cut carbon taxes .	-3.5808
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that Abbott ’ s daughters would benefit personally from the laws .	-3.0512
“ He is in a great conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not they get a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.9856
Two months after the election , the Palmer Electoral Commission officially declared the winner of the Sunshine Coast Meeting by Fairfax , with 53 votes ahead of the new counting .	-5.4069
Palmer called for a revision of the voting counting process so that it can proceed faster .	-3.3128
Tony Abbott 's daughters Frances and Bridget .	-1.1868
Should these elections be held two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.8006
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-1.0362
Why should we not have a system in which to enter , enter the data into a computer , immediately choose and then have the result at 6 : 30 p.m.	-5.7996
Palmer also criticized the use of pencil marking the ballot papers .	-2.4978
Do you use it because you can wipe out the results if you don 't like them ?	-4.4089
Vote today with pencil is unbelievable .	-3.3575
The Electoral Commission has examined options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.6724
Palmer , 59 , declared that his policy is an international airport for Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “ very seriously . ”	-3.2520
A public office is about serving the public .	-2.9638

RCS suspended two Forex traders	-1.5124
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , so two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the worldwide regulatory investigation into the alleged currency market manipulation is taking a fast pace .	-6.4494
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank and RBS , have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities in investigations in the world ’ s largest financial market , where US $ 5.3 trillion per day changes the owner ’ s .	-5.2554
The two traders would be the first RBS-employees who were suspended in the widening investigation that attracted the Libor Interbank scandal .	-5.6479
The Bank , which made no comment on suspensions , confirmed this month that they had received requests for information from authorities .	-3.7588
“ Our investigations on this issue go further and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” the Bank said two weeks ago .	-3.3083
Last month , people close to the situation told that the RBS sent e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a previous merchant to the UK Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-4.6470
This trader , Richard Usher , had left the RBS in 2010 and is now to have been certified by his current position as European head of the forex spot trading at JPMorgan .	-5.4119
Raw Ramchandani , Head of European Spot Trading at Citi , was certified this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly Head of Currency Exchange at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-4.5894
Keinem of these traders was accused of some misconduct .	-2.0727
Bankers at Barclays and Citigroup , told people close to the situation .	-3.4491
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees , after the Swiss regulatory authority , Finma , declared that it seeks a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market with a number of Swiss banks .	-5.6395
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the United States Department of Justice and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently examining allegations that bankers should have agreed on transactions in the currency market .	-5.9010
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or requests for information from authorities , said the situation of familiar people .	-3.4862
Banks handle instant messages and emails from several years in search of misbehavior .	-3.6629
The news about these investigations has been roiled by traders in an area that has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks in recent years , but was under pressure this year because low volatility in currencies restricts the opportunities for speculators .	-5.8595
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.7786
A leading trader noticed that , despite the enormous daily volume of foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of internal platforms by banks mean that “ you can already influence the market with very low ticket travel . ”	-6.3328
The news came out on the same day that Credit Suisse announced that it had cancelled a London Exchange Traded Funds dealer this week after causing a loss of nearly $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-5.6852
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-1.9600
“ We are sure that the trader has acted alone and that the matter is curbed , ” said Credit Suisse .	-3.2393
Building zaun on the Bechtle Land is painted .	-4.1876

Alfred Abel , who is currently managing the plot , agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke from the BI .	-5.4723
Before the action of the BI , there was a banner with the message ' We are in favour ' .	-4.9961
This , however , did not disturb the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative in their actions .	-3.5722
Your motto on the large poster was " We are against building ruins " .	-2.9703
She wanted to point out the danger of even bigger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the huge project should one day fail .	-5.7638
In conversation with many people in front of the " building site " it became clear that some citizens believe that the realisation of the city 's project will be better for many , although not many have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-7.0390
But they are beginning to resist , because the city continues to delay these responses , it is called by the BI .	-5.5576
As has been said , public statements by the Mayor also work .	-4.3840
In May , the local Council meeting said that he was afraid of losing the thermal baths if the people were to vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow in the .	-6.7785
Some seem to be scared , others see them as " clumsy blackmail " on the population , says the BI press release .	-6.5148

Schiris Rancish : Don ’ t forget to bring down a yawning King .	-9.5207
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of the German Red Bull Salzburg table leader , the sports director of the " Bullen " was disappointed by the arbitrators .	-6.4929
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Manse and Alan to be forced into the category of the Swabian Queen , " he took protection of the two offensive inverters on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-5.5204
The most recent reason for Rangers ’ criticism was Yellow for Manse at 3 : 0 on Sunday , when the Senegalesen was losing an alleged acting career - which was not , of course , as the TV images showed .	-9.5556
" A gross misdecision " , Rannick noted , the arbitrator Harkam called " completely overwhelmed " .	-6.6058
Harkam also played " his part " in the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and the largest coach , Adi Hütter .	-5.5377
He vigorously defended his German compatriot : ' I would have behaved in every situation like Roger Schmidt ' .	-4.7527
After the skirmish , Schmidt himself did not want to have any contact with his colleague . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.9494
I do not know why .	-1.4984
" For I am the one who was offended " , stressed the 46-year-old .	-3.3633
But Rannick voted a chorus of praise in the face of this success .	-5.8361
" There are only two words for this : correct , " he notes .	-4.1729
There is not much to criticise .	-2.7319

Supreme Court reaffirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-2.1054
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the law on health closely linked to Barack Obama is constitutional .	-4.2863
With five votes to four , the judges judged that the individual mandate of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a fine by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority .	-5.4554
The Chief Justice John Roberts beat on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy decided against it .	-6.4668
The court also confirmed the remaining sections of the Act of 2700 pages , and also argued that the specification of the Health Act , whereby states would either have to expand access requirements for Medicaid , or otherwise remove all State funding from Medicaid , was not unconstitutional .	-8.3305
The legal proceedings against the law had been initiated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-4.5628
The law was decisively rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the eventual challenger Mitt Romney , in the 2012 presidential campaign .	-3.0347
Norway : The Norwegian City is filled with giant lights .	-5.5156
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian <unk>rt<unk>s light have brought to their gloomy valley .	-5.6382
The Rjukan , located in the Vestfjordd valley , usually falls in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-6.1246
With three giant reflectors at 45 meters high , a space for centuries was found on Wednesday .	-5.2674
" Finally ! " , Mayor Steinar Bergsland appeared at the launch ceremony at the broadcaster TV2 .	-4.9211
Some inhabitants of the valley were entitled to sun chairs , others were wearing sunglasses for safety .	-5.1513
So far , sun-hungry people have had to take a cable car to nearby summits in winter .	-4.2521
Ten years ago , the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to direct radiation using mirrors into the valley .	-2.8861

Little mail leaves Sunday .	-5.4270
" Many citizens will not yet have noticed the red points for Sunday leases are still present at various correspondence boxes of the core city and the parts of the city , but you can read the small print on the yellow box of Post AG , you can quickly find out that the vomiting on Sundays and public holidays is no longer taking place " , the FDP informs .	-10.1686

Whether it is held in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP question .	-4.1648
The Social and Youth Policy spokesman for the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to give up here .	-4.9994
Sunday leaching is an important postal service especially at appointment .	-5.0108
" This undertaking , despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 , is radically and unreasonable " .	-3.5673
Thomas Bittner , the Liberal Group ’ s Committee on Foreign Affairs and the Internal Market , supports his group colleague : " What irritates me is the fact that , in this case , space changes or is also removed " .	-7.4345
The post office is very close to the hotel .	-5.1176
" At least the post boxes in the districts of Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck are united .	-5.9089
Even for the core city , especially non-mobile citizens , a postbox with Sundays would have to be able to arrive on the ground .	-7.9883
In the municipal parliament , Röhrenbeck asked whether the municipal administration plans to discuss this matter with the post office .	-5.8055
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lamberheim .	-1.8681
But there is also a soapy in Hofheim .	-4.2409

This is not to raise prices , but rather to reduce the time interval from parking watches and ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-6.1440
In December , the Municipal Assembly will have to decide .	-3.3180
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-2.7213

With a small cader , the gentlemen I of the TSV Freudienstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen had to compete against the TG Gönningen of the Swabian Alb .	-5.9421
The elders were with an experienced team on the other net .	-3.0120

With the hard and bumpy shoots the Gornninger did extremely hard .	-7.1036
They repeatedly passed the passports and attacks that Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz played cleanly over the middle of the network and were not there for blocking .	-9.8747
Two high first Satzprofits clearly emphasized the superiority of the Freudiehler in all respects .	-5.4415

In the B-class the second teams from Baiersbbronn and Freudienstadt were in front of the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-5.3917
They delivered a tough two-hour match .	-3.2584
Nervion on both sides caused errors and points to be taken in particular ; even on passports , the precision was sometimes scarce and in some critical game scenes , the excess prevented the view of possible score gains .	-9.0588

Small England cottage Care Day	-3.3905
The fifth maintenance day in the succession of the Natura 2000 project Upper Hotzenwald met a group of dedicated participants at the small England hut in Ibach .	-5.0074
Due to suggestions from the population should be freed this day in the cabin of the view into the valley , Mayor Helmut Kaiser said .	-5.8131
Many hikers referred to this area as the pearl of the Schlachtensteig , where the landscape provides the ideal setting for magnificent views .	-6.2397
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the care day is an appropriate tool for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-5.3864
They offer every citizen the opportunity to set their own accents in nature .	-4.7397
At the same time as the tourist aspect , environmental consideration can be given .	-4.6501
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Triukait from the conservation department of the government headquarters of Freiburg following the greeting by Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be a success .	-7.0862
According to Triukait , the tourist goal of the long-sightedness is to preserve the now heavily enclosed old Allmendweidfeld with its specific protected habitat types by opening and linking to the existing pastures .	-7.7454
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grasses , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-3.2537
You need these free connections to Artemision .	-2.4622
Triffukait said that she would not fail at this point to break up a lance for the planned biosphere reserve .	-7.7597
In this planning , the current measure does not just go seamlessly .	-4.8650
A biosphere reserve also provides an opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous extension of the life project as well as the previous care days for the future .	-6.9812
After these various statements , director Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff assigned the helpers in groups .	-5.5203
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance and the forest vessels may be ready to call .	-6.3932

Google , Samsung , Huawei due to Nortel patents sued .	-2.9594
On Thursday , the group that owns thousands of former Nortel patents forced an avalanche of lawsuits against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was outbid Nortel for insolvency auctioning .	-6.5505
Rockstar , the consortium that had bought the Nortel patent for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringement before the US District Court in Texas .	-6.7955
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , Blackberry , Ericsson and Sony .	-2.1431
Google is accused of patent infringement in seven cases .	-1.3380
The patents favor technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , so the action that meets the core of Google ’ s search engine business .	-4.9989
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-3.0889
Samsung , Huawei and HTC create mobile phones that work with Google ’ s operating system Android that stands in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft ’ s mobile products .	-3.1033
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid for more than $ 900 million for the Nortel patents .	-3.0950
Google increased its offer several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-3.0190
After it was outbid on the Nortel patents by Rockstar , Google acquired Mobility for $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by Motorolas ’ s library of patents .	-6.2688
“ Although Google has failed to acquire the securities securities in the auction , Google has violated and continues to do so , ” says the trademark .	-6.1948
Rockstar claims heavy damages from Google because it claims that Google 's patent infringement is intentional , so the accusation is accusation .	-4.6410
Egypt recognizes the first freely elected president	-3.3425
Mohammed Morsi surrendered the oath , but his day of triumph is unlikely to mean the end of Egypt ’ s political disputes .	-4.3047
Islamist Muhammad Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn into office as the country ’ s first freely elected president , thus triggering the succession of Hosni Mubarak , who had been expelled from office 16 months earlier .	-4.5833
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Arab world Islamist president and Egypt ’ s fifth leader since the overthrow of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-3.3193
He suspended the oath before the 18 judges who were dressed in black robes , who are seated at the Nile and who are replanted by an ancient Egyptian temple .	-6.6579
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second Republic , ” said Morsi at the ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-3.5081
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy , and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , an engineer trained in the US , and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that , since its foundation 84 years ago , has been largely targeted by the government as a banned organization .	-6.0812
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi arrived in a small autoconvoi shortly after 11 o 'clock of the place .	-4.0557
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to celebrate the new president , and , unlike Mubarak ’ s presidential president , traffic was only interrupted briefly so that autoconvoi could cross the typically busy road linking the city centre to southern suburbs .	-6.6494
As an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented himself not only as the candidate of the Islamists , but all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising against authoritarian Mubarak .	-5.6339
“ Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” said Morsi dressed in a blue suit with red ties to the judges in the wooden chamber in which he took office .	-4.8880

The University of Cairo , built in 1908 as a bastion of secular education , has become a stronghold of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .	-3.4217
On Friday , Morsi issued a symbolic oath at Tahra Square , the birthplace of the uprising that led to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule last year , and he vowed to reclaim the presidential powers conferred by the Military Council from the office .	-6.5021
But by deceiving the official oath to the Court rather than to Parliament as usual , it prevents the will of the military , which points out that the power struggle will continue .	-6.0247
Morsi ’ s speech in Tahrir Square was filled with dramatic populist gestures .	-2.3510
Falkenberger discotheque provides for two great evenings .	-3.1657

rapist in South Africa : two life imprisonment	-5.0584
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was twice condemned on Friday .	-2.5151
This was reported by the broadcaster SABC .	-3.0583
The victim was later killed by the consequences of serious injuries .	-2.4890
Johannes Cana was found guilty of crime earlier this week .	-2.1663
Indeed , the country was horrified .	-3.5706
The then 21-year-old had raped Anene Booysen in February at an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town .	-3.9735
14 hours were the doctors fighting for the survival of the victim , but in vain .	-2.0537
The sight of young people was so terrible that carers and sisters needed psychological support .	-2.9589
Kana admitted during the trial that he had been in a bar with Booysen .	-5.9171
He also confessed to having beaten and raped them , but he did charge the death of the girl .	-4.2428
The police had initially run out of several acts , but released two suspects out of prison because the evidence against them was not enough .	-5.6344
The prosecution also emphasized during the trial that Kana was alone at the time of the attack .	-3.4568
rapes are common in South Africa : there are around 64 000 sexual violence ads every year .	-5.3250
These are almost ten times as much as in Germany , but with 82 million people there are far more inhabitants than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-4.2358
But the police and women ’ s organizations in South Africa estimate the number of sexual violence unreported cases to 10-25 times .	-4.9178
Jumbo visits Black Forest Ham	-1.5565
Jumbo on the search for the " best ham in the world " : For the TV broadcast " Galileo " the Pro7-Star Bonndorf visited .	-3.1699
The speaker first makes it clear : the most important thing for the ham is pork kebabes , Turbomast is not a good condition .	-6.5675
Can the ham you get in any supermarket be a quality product ?	-3.9714
Uli as the head of the large Schinkenfabrik in the Black Forest explains Jumbo the way the company " Adler " works in Bonndorf .	-4.4549
" Germany 's most loved ham " , as Jumbo announced the Black Forest ham .	-3.0855

Television with level ?	-2.0904
Details such as the Ph value of meat also matter .	-2.8757
The darker the meat , the higher the ph-value .	-1.8984
" I 'm curious when your Roberto Blanco posts what happens then " , so Jumbo cynically .	-5.6612
Here the level of private television is presented in Reinkultur .	-4.0611
But the spectator is still worth it .	-2.6757
The spectator sees that the breaking of the chases remains handcraft .	-4.2472
For : Black Forest ham is traditionally found without bones in the shelf .	-2.6768
The secret of ham is the melting of spices with salt .	-3.1346
Smooth tower and smoke fire remind Jumbo optically of a " subboot " .	-8.2843
The trick is that tannins make sure that the special taste of Black Forest ham is in smoke .	-5.5376
After all , 20 days in the smoke make the ham almost black .	-2.7017
" Now the disc disappears in the Jumbo " , he terminates the test verspeisu.	-4.0653
" It 's really delicious " , says the conclusion of the TV screen .	-4.9748

You thought that travel agencies are owned by the past thanks to the internet ?	-3.6463
Flight Centre seems to be resisting the trend .	-1.1311
The company has increased its earnings prospects for the year as a whole and expects record revenues from holidaymakers from Australia and the UK .	-5.5418
The travel company is now running out of an adjusted annual profit before taxes between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 315 million in its earlier forecast .	-5.7058
If current targets are met , growth of 12-17 % will be compared to the record gain of $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .	-4.7253
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre achieved eight percent profit in the first half of the year and had a strong start to the second half of the year , especially in Australian and British private businesses .	-5.2003
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on track towards record income before interest and taxes , ” he explained .	-4.4955
These include Australia and Great Britain , which are typically among our most powerful earnings figures .	-3.2088
In Australia , the leisure sector has recovered in the second half of the year , leaving a slightly weaker market for business trips .	-14.5825
Flight Centre operates similarly well in the UK , and business customers are spending less in this area too .	-6.6778
The US business rebounded against the seasonally weaker first half of the year , so a profit for the third consecutive year is expected for the entire year .	-6.0883
Flight Centre shares yesterday rose by 3 cents to $ 38.20 .	-2.4654
Schools are encouraged to focus more on mathematics , spelling , and grammar .	-1.8957
In English literature , students will have to consider at least one piece of Shakespeare , a 19th century novel , romantic poetry and contemporary British novels from 1914 .	-5.2537
The test also includes “ unsighted texts ” to encourage more extensive reading .	-6.3555
The combined course of English literature and language is abolished .	-1.8349
As of 2015 , students must take a separate GCSE exam for language , with strong incentives for choosing English literature as a separate qualification .	-4.9521
The Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and mathematics tomorrow – the first subjects that have been radically transformed .	-3.2486
Other core subjects will be changed next year .	-2.0722
In a separate initiative , Ofjel , the Supervisory Authority for Examinations , a reorganization of the GCSE structures will announce , including a new Benot system and less course work .	-7.2500
In a speech in the summer , education minister Michael Gove said that there is a “ broad consensus that we need to reform our auditing system to restore public confidence , ” emphasizing that the GCSes will become “ more challenging , ambitious , and stricter . ”	-4.8507
Studies show that in English schools , less time is spent on mathematics – 116 hours a year or three hours a week per school year – than in most other countries .	-3.2185
However , Australian schools provide an average of 143 hours a year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-4.1115
Although there will be no formal requirement to devote more time to mathematics in the timetable , from coalition groups , the comprehensive test – combined with a stronger ranking of the specialist – is likely to encourage schools to spend more hours .	-6.7232
The curriculum focuses more on “ problems from the right life , ” including financial mathematics .	-3.2493

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Discussion Forum	-2.9735
The next Ecumenical forum on Monday , 21 October , at the New Museum of the castle is about " The hell with hell - Theological reflections on the way things are today " .	-7.1871
She is a professor , Johanna Rahner .	-3.0078
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative of Catholic and evangelical Church parishes of Salem , the Salem Palace and the Environment Office .	-9.7504
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum the question of how today people classify the " last things " after death .	-4.4996
If people had known too much of this in the past centuries , placing them on the pictures of heaven and hell , " which still characterize our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic lesson of the hopes of completion is more marked by a certain embarrassment or even a lack of language .	-9.3316
" The greater hope has been poured out by the criticism of religion " , says the referent .	-5.2619
You have ' provided us with so many question marks that the exclamations seem to have disappeared ' .	-6.0696
Johanna Rahner further says : " But the decisive challenge remains the offence of death " .	-3.3611
This is the question of the longing that ' dreams of everything being good at the end ' .	-4.8660
Johanna Rahner , born in 1962 in Baden-Baden , studied Catholic theology and biology at the Albert-Ludwigs-University Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-2.2974
She was born in Freiburg , Germany .	-3.1962

The ministry accompanied the Laudato-Si group in the afternoon of The Spirit Youth Choir .	-3.6396
With the reception of the firmament the young people said yes to their baptism and inherited the power of the Holy Spirit .	-4.4847
The company owners had prepared themselves for the big day in the last few months , under the direction of Dikon Reiner Dehner and the cooperation of numerous community members .	-6.5549
In various projects , they learned different tasks of Christian community life and together attended the Youth Day in Unterimpot .	-8.0378
Illmensee : Two mountain bike races thrilled participants .	-2.6832
In superb weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to manage the round course across the hills around the lake .	-5.0417
Ulrich Knobel shares this with the organizing sport association Illmensee .	-3.1982
Among the participants , especially on the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also a number of Jesermannsradlers who wanted to practise their hobby once in competitive atmosphere .	-7.6478
Two top German students were also at the start of the race : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German championships .	-6.0810
They were expected to move from the field .	-4.0536
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small time jump to the goal and defended his title as a complete winner of the short distance .	-6.0113
Once again Pascal Treubel was placed in place two .	-5.1313
At the ladies , Theresa Duelli was from the team nightmare that made it to the top of the winning ranges .	-5.1508
Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen took place two and three .	-2.9012
Good development is the increasing number of drivers who live or work in the community .	-3.4363
Not only in terms of capacity , the whole range of sportsmen was represented .	-3.9513
The age structure , too , was ten years old when the young people up to 70 were among the oldest people .	-6.8138
In the main race this year more absolute top athletes were at the start .	-4.4227
Four drivers were able to take off from the top regional drivers .	-5.0358
Beneath Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black-Tuk Racing-Team .	-4.5415
Pangerl , together with a team-mate , was once the world champion on the 12-hour ride .	-5.2187
This year he became European champion of this special discipline .	-2.2297
Roland Ballerstedt , who already names two German master titles in the duathlon , is his own .	-4.6689
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , a winding final took place in the end in front of the three lakes hall .	-5.9592
Pangerl laid the finishing line first .	-3.4560
Only a second behind this the routine Ballerstedt could secure second place in the overall rating .	-5.1968
Hermann and Wartmann came to the fore as a third party in the overall evaluation period .	-5.1892
In the ladies evaluation , Christiane Cohsmann was the time fastest in the main lady .	-5.3285

Running through mud , rivers , and jungle for free medical care	-3.4376
Dr. Georges Bwave offers free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon .	-2.3397
Bwave and his team spend nearly every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-1.8023
There are not many doctors in the West African country , only one for 5,000 people .	-2.0095
Vote now or use your mobile device .	-1.8306
Dr. Georges Bwave is among the top 10 of the “ CNN Heroes of 2013 ” .	-3.5714
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the Top 10 to choose him as the “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-3.0020
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-2.1187
For 21 years , Georges Bwave saw how his ill father lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-4.0308
Jamef Bwave was injured in 1981 in an car accident near Yaoondé , the capital of Cameroon .	-3.0247
First he had only a broken arm , but then there was an inflammation that spread to his brain and caused a hematom to affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.7019
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwave .	-2.5236
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.2028
Instead , Bwave spent years watching his father in crowded hospitals and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-5.1866
" It is not easy " , comments Bwave .	-2.4133
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. and run to the hospital to be the first , and it is not first .	-4.1791
There are many patients .	-1.6327
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.7601
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell 's father died in 2002 .	-3.7017
In Cameroon , there is only one physician for each 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organisation .	-3.4365
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.1626
But even if there was a doctor for them , most Cameroon could not afford to visit .	-3.8569
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and almost three-quarters of health spending in the country is private .	-2.6585
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-1.7355
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.9430
His father and so many of his compatriots suffered a decision in Bwave to do something about it .	-3.8925
Dr. Georges Bwave and his volunteer team conducted 700 free operations last year .	-3.2494
He became a doctor himself and worked as a caption surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoondé .	-4.5995
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels in rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-4.1591
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-2.7502
Almost every Friday he snowed and up to 30 people ride in small coaches and ride over uncheeled terrain in the villages that need help .	-6.2052
Not always everything runs smoothly .	-1.9805
For more than once , they had to shift the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-3.1106
But when they arrive , they will receive as heroes : a feast dinner , singing and dancing , and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.8820
In these villages , free medical care really is a reason to celebrate and combat – with its broad smile and its limitless energy – is happy with the cheerful celebration .	-4.9446
The next morning the team starts investigating hundreds of patients .	-2.6289
<unk> We treat 500 persons per journey “ , according to Bwave .	-5.1267
They come from a 60 km radius around the village – and on foot .	-3.2256
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-3.0697
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.8239
Others receive crutches , sprayed glasses or free birth certificates – a document necessary for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-4.5385
In the evening , the team will perform simple local stunting operations .	-4.3525
The operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or an apartment ; after the surgery patients stand up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .	-5.6715
The lighting for the OP and disinfectant is fed by the generator of the group and so work Bwave and his volunteers until the early morning hours of the Sunday .	-5.3772
It is an exhausting Pensum , but village musicians usually help to keep the team motivated .	-2.6322
" They drum the whole night so we can stay awake and continue our work , " says Bwave .	-3.9174
On Sunday the team returns to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-2.9645
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people to whom it helps .	-4.8631
One man explained that the free operation of an outbreak that he had received now allows him to work again .	-3.9645
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-3.1319
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon at the hospital , Bwave also works in private clinics in Yaoondé at night .	-3.9553
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his nonprofit activity , according to Bwave ; the rest come from private donations .	-4.6231
“ I really do not know when he is sleeping , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who is studying at the Drexel University of Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and is working on a voluntary basis in Bwell Group .	-6.1073
He is always at the hospital or trying to raise money for the organization so that he can go to these campaigns .	-4.3688
For medical and health care students such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-4.0925
" We can be involved in operations where we help to extract blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwave , " says O 'Malley .	-5.2264
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-2.2895
The students usually pay their journey to Cameroon and bring with them often diversified sanitation material .	-6.7125
Once in Yaoundé , however , Bwave takes care of accommodation , transport and instructions .	-5.1220
“ He is certainly a hero , ” says O ’ Malley .	-2.4613
He is dedicated to his life and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries .	-3.8863
For Bwave , the almost constant work is not a burden .	-3.0147
He is very happy to help others to live a more happy life , and to make a promise he has given his father .	-7.6527
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwave .	-3.8062
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.0430
I hope he will see what I am doing .	-1.2840
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve the pain .	-2.6985

Excellently engaged in fighting	-3.8882
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , is Horst Janson cut to the body .	-3.5520
Janson is himself an old hand in his Metier , of acting art .	-3.6580
The old man Santiago cannot fish .	-3.8656
The two simply complement each other great .	-3.8158
We almost think we can see the hawks in the naked man who speaks of the fisherman 's young Manolo .	-5.1519
When Santiago is tired of life praying on the chair , Janson is right .	-5.1998
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson superbly manages .	-5.4504
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish through his knowledge and also his will .	-3.8724
Janson is on stage in many ways as the sole performer .	-5.3404
It creates the attention of the audience to focus , so its monologues are not a moment boring .	-3.5538
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of the water are so genuine that the spectators forget that the sea is only made of blue lit water bottles .	-4.5916
Director Jens Hasselmann is leaving the old man in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.9622
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene into the light : The hut of Santiago , the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who with her songs and her wonderful voice will share the feel of Cuba .	-7.4866
The four musicians play Cuba 's rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.7422

At about 120 meters in length , a Roman sewage canal is preserved below Cologne .	-6.0086
If you are visiting Cologne , the cathedral is not over .	-4.8769
Around 157 meters the two towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.7561
But only a few visitors admire the two filigree church towers suggest that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-5.1617
Rainer Schulze is an expert on the cologne underworld .	-3.0460
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne Tourism directly at the cathedral .	-4.0018
The walk starts quite unspectacular : " We start in the underground car park " says Schulze .	-3.4570
In the 1970s , the city ’ s fathers wanted an autochthonous city , and that ’ s why the remains of the old city walls remained just what was not too great .	-6.5153
Most users of the park now also run past the Roman remnants and only leave their car .	-6.3872
However , if you look more closely , you will see an archaeological site separated by metal mesh bars on the D2 parking deck .	-6.8557
The ruins of hand-painted stone are approximately five metres high .	-4.8882
" There are remnants of the Roman walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ " , says Schulze .	-3.5845
Before it comes back to the daylight , the participants at the upper level still have a look at a dark , 15 metres deep shaft .	-8.0442
This is the well of the old Cathedral , which is unfortunately hardly recognized .	-4.3086
Next station of the round is the shelter , and here the participants go down to the depth .	-6.2449
We are here to experience the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the forerunner of the CCAA .	-4.0698
What CCAA means is to know a visitor .	-2.1939
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which in good German means as much as " City of Roman Law and the city of the Agrippinenser , founded under Emperor Claudius at the site of the Altar means the emperor " .	-8.5823
And the Pratorium is the former palace of connectors , the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-4.1680
From the front area of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewerage channel , which is here at about 120 meters in length .	-5.8284
" You can calmly walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima , if you want , " encourages the guests .	-5.2646
One surprise is that Schulze still has .	-4.4758

The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square for which the construction works will begin shortly .	-3.8695

Apparently there was a hunt for follows with several cars .	-3.7886
The charges were about turf and a demonstration of power .	-3.7141
The two accused had been acquitted in a first trial in early 2012 .	-2.7203

As a witness , the Commissioner at that time was invited .	-3.2597
At the centre were mobile calls from the defendants and other people who had heard the police .	-4.9444

I admit , I am happy to attend when there is fast food late at night or early morning .	-4.7778
A few Pommes , a Cola , a Burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-2.9980
But on the way home , the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco geese are noticeable .	-4.3929
Because what is missing is that you regularly throw your fast food from the car window ? !	-6.6138
Especially at the weekends , discarded paper bags are on the streets and parking spaces .	-4.8081

In response to the numerous media reports on evictions , Obama urged Americans who received such communications to look around the free market after a new insurance policy .	-4.9019
Most citizens could thus obtain better , more comprehensive health coverage at the same price or less favorable than anticipated .	-4.8366
“ You get a better offer , ” he said .	-2.3852
The government described it as little surprising that the five % of the population who have completed insurance would have to look at another rate , as their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-7.1969
“ I would like to say to these Americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” Sealius said at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee in Washington .	-4.0693
