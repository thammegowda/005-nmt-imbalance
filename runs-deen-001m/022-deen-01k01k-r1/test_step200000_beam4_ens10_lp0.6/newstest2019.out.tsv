The spokesman of the national civil protection agency , Mr Sutopo , said that Indonesian officials would evaluate the situation in Palu in order to see whether international organisations can contribute to the aid measures .	-5.8043
Given the earthquakes that Indonesia is constantly suffering , the country is unfortunately not well prepared for the forces of nature .	-3.5134
While the tsunami safety rooms were built in Aceh , what is not customary for other coastal lines .	-3.5642
The obvious absence of a tsunami warning siren in Palu , although a warning has already been in force , is likely to have contributed to the loss of human life .	-2.9403

The Cromwell Parliament ’ s statue will be the recent monument success of the ‘ history ’ series	-11.5104

US Should Double Artificial Intelligence Spensions	-1.5503
While China becomes more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investment , says Kai-Fu Lee , investor , and AI practitioners working for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.2632
These demands emerged after members of the US administration made announcements to the AI , even though the US lacked a formal AI strategy .	-3.3818
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-2.7380
“ A doubling of expenditure on AI research would be a good start , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is about to come , ” said Lee .	-11.6805
The doubling of funding could double the chances that the next achievement in the US ’ s artificial intelligence will be achieved , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.5341
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the new world order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI companies , Face + + .	-2.9282
In the 1980s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated American high-ranking Othello players , and later became leader at Microsoft Research and President of the Chinese branch of Google .	-4.6815
Lee has recognized and asked the US administration ’ s previous technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defence Research Agency ) , which would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-3.9435
“ Researchers in the US often need to work very hard to get state grants , ” Lee said .	-2.7182
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but businesses , ” Lee said .	-3.1869
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have hired university coryphs in recent years to work on AI .	-3.1211
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US to reinforce its AI efforts .	-2.3885
“ I think green cards should automatically be offered to doctorates in KI , ” he said .	-2.9415
The Chinese Council of State presented its next generation artificial intelligence plan in July 2017 .	-2.1422
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to the way the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-3.4483
Earlier this year , the US The Department of Defence has established a joint artificial intelligence center that is to include industrial and scientific partners , and the White House has announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-4.1492
And this month , DARPA has announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an initiative called “ AI Next ” .	-11.2197
As far as the NSF is concerned , it is currently investing more than $ 100 million per year in AI research .	-1.8714
Meanwhile , US legislation , which wanted to create a national security commission for artificial intelligence , has not been heard for months .	-3.8476
Macedonia is voting in a referendum on whether to change its name .	-2.2165
The people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on Sunday on whether their name should be changed in the ' Republic of North Macedonia ' , a step that would resolve a decades-long dispute with Greece , which had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-7.0764
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour is a territorial claim to the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.0612
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Slav majority population of Macedonia .	-2.2463
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote at the referendum , and in the light of a boycott campaign , there is doubt as to whether the result will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a precondition for the referendum to be valid .	-4.6869
The question on the referendum paper was : ' Are you for NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.3783
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth the price to continue admitting institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.0594
“ I came today to vote on the country ’ s future ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life of greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.1166
Although not legally binding , sufficient Members have said they will follow the outcome of the vote to make it crucial .	-3.7367
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for the change of name .	-2.0495
The Committee on Legal Affairs said at 3 p.m. that there were no reports of irregularities .	-4.3659
But the turnout was only 16 % – at the last parliamentary election in 2016 , the figure was 34 % at the same time , and , in the end , 66 % of registered voters voted .	-3.9171
“ I went for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.7385
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica , and his son , Dushko , voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on changing the name of the country , which would pave the way for NATO and the European Union to join Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.6892
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs before the tents set by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.0281
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads upwards , not through the door , " said Kavadarkov .	-2.8501
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.4464
If you do not wish to accept us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-5.8506
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring urgently needed investment to Macedonia , a country with more than 20 % unemployment .	-2.2472
“ I believe a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev declared after handing over his vote . , .	-7.0818
According to him , the result would be “ yes ” a “ strengthening of our future . ”	-2.3942
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would thus participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-3.1977
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of the respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.9689
Of those who wish to participate , 70 % said that they were voting “ yes . ”	-3.4635
The referendum will only be accepted if voter turnout exceeds 50 % .	-12.7054
Failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to pro-Western government policy since it took office in May last year .	-2.7618

Then he made a pass to the left and gave it to Sterling .	-2.5690
The English storm used his first contact to play the ball back to Agüero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton Torwart Mathew Ryan in the right side of the gate .	-4.1438
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City Manager Pep Guardiola to the reporters .	-2.2291
“ We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.3131
That has happened .	-1.0183
Fortunately , he launched a gate at the moment . ”	-2.0268
However , it was Sterling who initially led the Sky Blues at the Premier League duel :	-2.6857

Scherzer wants to Play Against Rockies	-1.8163
Since national players were excluded from playoff competition , there was little reason to force a further start .	-2.8061
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are playoff implications for rockies that have a lead from a game before the Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-4.3676
The rockies secured at least one spot on Friday evening with a 5 : 2 victory over the Nationals , but the first league title gain is still not sure .	-6.1634
" Even if we play for free , we can at least put ourselves in the stuff because we know that the atmosphere here here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best thing to offer us this year .	-4.5288
Why do I not want to make an effort ? '	-3.2459
The nationals have not yet announced a start on Sunday , but are allegedly inclined to throw jokers in such a situation .	-6.2151

The Labour Party is no longer a wide community .	-1.5432
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.8873
As a momentum activist in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-1.9900
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour Members who say that we are not welcome - just because we have said our opinion .	-3.4929
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , has been treated similarly because she has firmly opposed anti-Semitism .	-2.8189

The communication for the East Labour in Nottingham on Friday says : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-3.1304
Most of my time during the eight years as a local Labour MEP , the GC meetings on Friday evening were exactly the same . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.9160
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' friender , soft ' policy has long been forgotten when it has ever begun .	-7.0551
It has become increasingly clear that differences of opinion in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and every opinion is judged by whether it is acceptable to party leadership .	-3.4471
This began shortly after Jeremy 's inauguration , because my colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to take a U-turn and take positions with which I would never otherwise have agreed , be it on national security or the EU internal market .	-9.5009
Whenever I speak out publicly – and it does not matter what I say – a tirade of abuse in the social media calling for voting , denouncing the Centre ’ s policy and telling me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-4.0383
This experience has not only been achieved .	-2.9063
I do know , in fact , that more luck than some of my colleagues , since the comments addressed to me tend to be politically political . .	-7.6171
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues , who are subjected to a flood of sexist or racist abuse every day , but never shy .	-6.7021
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the scale of abuse has normalized .	-2.4734
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.6957
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or change of the rules of selection , the party becomes smaller .	-4.2317
Over the last two years I have received a lot of advice on collecting my neck , not being so vocal , and then I would be ‘ right ’ .	-4.5114
That is why I have not come to politics .	-2.7045
Thirty-two years ago , as a student , I joined Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , which led to my classroom literally collapsing , and as a result I tried to push for better public services for those who need it most , whether as a local council or minister .	-5.7347
I have never hid my political views , even at the last election .	-2.4728
As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody in Nottingham East should have been confused in any way , the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-3.4564
I would just like to say to those who supported the Friday request that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to stay loyal to me and to the Labour Party when the country is heading towards a Brexit that is damaging to households , businesses and our public services .	-4.5115
But the only message I have does not go to Nottingham Momentum , but to my constituents , whether Labour Members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that no threats to vote or political opportunities will prevent me from working in what I believe is the best interest of all of you .	-3.7084

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr Unbeaten at the top	-1.9730
Two late Tries may have distorted the end result somewhat , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserved to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's Premiership Match of the day .	-3.0746
They now run the table as the only unbeatable of the ten teams .	-2.9105
It was due to the outstanding defence of the host , but also to the fact that opportunities were better exploited .	-5.9569
" We were tested so far by our games and we are still unbeatable , so I have to be happy , " he said .	-2.6789
Robyn Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their chances . ”	-2.0951
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt in the 14th minute transformed by Frazier Climo brought Ayr forward , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak figures , and gave Jason Baggot an unchanged attempt .	-3.9978
Climo stretched the leadership of Ayr with a punishment before he obtained a hit directly at the half-time and then made a solo attempt to get him into the 17-5 break for Ayr .	-6.3336
Melrose started the second half well , and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform Baggot , reduced the backward to five poin.	-4.0969
After restarting , Ayr built the leadership when a try of Staford McDowall-von Climo was transformed .	-5.3714
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson then got the yellow card and again let Melrose pay the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt , at the end of an escape of heavy pressure .	-4.2879
However , the page came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a tackling without a ball of Climo from the criminal border , MacPherson made a touchdown , the upper Ayr .	-5.0102

Throughout Bolivia , the memory of a coast lost in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century with Chile is still alive - as is the desire to return to the Pacific .	-4.8053
These hopes may be at their peak for decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a ruling by the International Court on 1 October after five years of discussions .	-3.7734
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and the calm and , of course , expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.3156
Many Bolivians will follow the International Court judgment on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Hague Tribunal will prefer Bolivia 's claim that after decades of troubled talks , Chile will have to negotiate to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-4.3291
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – who faces a controversial battle for re-election next year – also depends very much on Monday ’ s decision .	-3.1504
“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.4399
However , some analysts find it unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not change .	-3.4576
The Dutch UN institution has no authority to give Chilean territory and has stated that it will not determine the outcome of possible discussions .	-8.9329
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice was achieved only six months after consultation of the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' said Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-3.7173
And far from driving Bolivia ’ s cause forward , the last four years may have delayed it .	-3.2503
“ The question of access to the sea is used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes , ” said Zárate .	-2.0947
Moral warrior rhetoric destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , she proposed .	-7.7485

Calzadilla also denied that Morales , who continues to be one of Latin America ’ s most popular presidents , uses the issue of access to the sea politically for his purposes .	-3.2390
“ Bolivia will never give up the right to access the Pacific Ocean , ” he added .	-1.4966

North Korea says that nuclear disarmament will not come , unless it can trust the US .	-1.5897
The North Korean Foreign Secretary Ri Yong Ho says that his nation will never defuse its nuclear weapons first if it cannot trust Washington .	-2.4917
Ri spoke to the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday .	-1.5035
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a summit of the two rival leaders in Singapore .	-2.5311
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume diplomatic discussions on nuclear disarmament three months after the meeting with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore .	-3.0594

Independent schools in Scotland have a success balance sheet of academic high quality , which continued in 2018 with outstanding testing results , including individual and group successes in sports , art , music and other community enterprises .	-5.2916
With over 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , strive to offer their students the best service level .	-3.1649
Independent schools are designed to prepare students for further education , including at universities , their desired career and their role as world citizens .	-3.9374

A 2014 survey by the British Employment and Qualifications Commission showed that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty in filling free jobs are attributed to a lack of language skills .	-3.7563
Therefore , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-2.8120
These skills are essential in a globalised world , given the opportunities for employment that languages require .	-3.8070

It is the first of five planned election events next week , with Trump visiting Republican-friendly states Tennessee and Mississippi on his tour .	-3.1239
While confirming his candidate for the Supreme Court ’ s vacant body is still waiting , Trump needs to mobilize his electorate for the forthcoming midterm elections , because otherwise the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress if elected in November .	-5.5739

Trump will certainly respond to the hearings this week about the allegations of sexual abuse against his candidate for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office , which must be carried out by the Senate , was postponed by at least one week until the end of the FBI investigation .	-10.5481
But the main objective of these electoral events is to mobilise the Republicans , who face a decisive election in November .	-3.7139
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilise volunteers and supporters next week with the five election events to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-2.9651
“ The majority in Congress is at the top of the presidential agenda , so he visits as many states as possible just before the turbulent campaign starts , ” a spokesman of the Trump campaign , who wants to be named , Reuters .	-4.6392
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , the election event in Wesbanco Arena tonight could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-3.2224
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the state that he won in 2016 with more than 40 percentage points , will visit for the second time this month .	-2.3247
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia ’ s Senate , Patrick Morrisey , lagging behind in the polls .	-2.6228
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , Politologist at the University of West Virginia , said that it is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to improve his poll values .	-3.1357
Ryder Cup 2018 : The Team USA shows itself ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday singles	-17.3615
After three unilateral encounters , the four games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-2.4452
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-3.5368
So where would they say the momentum is now ?	-1.8799
“ They had a six-point lead , and now they are four , so we are probably giving a bit of impetus , ” Jordan Spieth said , when he withdrew for the day . ”	-4.7529
Europe is , of course , leading up to 4 points in advantage , with twelve more to be played .	-4.6773
But , as Spieth says , Americans feel somewhat windy in their sails , and there was much encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and each have three out of four points .	-8.0520
Spieth was considered and set an example from the very beginning .	-3.0054
These cheerful calls became louder when his round went on , he lost a decisive putt to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas resigned 2 points after 2 games .	-5.5131
His pleasure about the putt on the 15th hole with which she won the game was such that he thought he was still believing in the victory of the Americans .	-3.8380
" You really have to concentrate heavily and worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-9.2574
All that remains for each of these players .	-2.7976
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.0181
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.3194
Europe ’ s strange , but admirable couple plays errorless and simply does it all right .	-12.6021
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not achieve a Bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning nine behin.	-4.1479
This course and the way in which its energy appears to flow from this abandoned spectator quantity makes it a favorite on Sunday and when the sun goes over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player sealing a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-4.7389
Probably both at the same time at different holes .	-1.8116
To speak of a European victory now would be too premature .	-1.9460
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short trial with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.1916
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine , the Spaniard and the Swede divided into a hole that they never came out again .	-5.6044
But on Sunday there is no one who helps you out of your hole .	-12.8004
Because of the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change in the blind , it is very fascinating to see the fourballs and Foursomes close by .	-4.9816
Europe has played better as a team and has taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the team has the desire to fight , as some , especially statesides , have doubted .	-5.0181
Europe Leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Finaltag	-1.8347
Europe will take advantage of a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from the four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 leadership over the United States .	-3.5285
Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari inspired the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to put their previous balance sheet in Le Golf National on four points .	-3.4836
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took to preserve the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team fighting with slaughter at morning fourballs , and won the of 3-.	-5.4063
The US offered more resistance in the four and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.4595
Jim Furyk team needs eight points from the 12 Sunday single games to keep the trophy .	-2.9351
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second couple winning four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-9.5356
After destroying Woods and Patrick Reed in the fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat an even clearer 5 & 4 woods and American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau .	-4.1320
Woods , who travelled through two games on Saturday , sometimes showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 games in four-balls and four-farmers and seven consequ.	-4.7064
Justin Rose , resting for the morning fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-3.3397
On a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.3917
Three main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday .	-2.7402
They won a courageous 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourth pack and returned later to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the fourth pack after they lost the first two holes .	-8.3751
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Holter Furyk 's site needs only one draw to keep the trophy .	-3.8676
After two days of second time , however , a Sunday counter looks as though he would go beyond them .	-4.3023
North Korea says that “ there will be no unilateral disarmament without trust ”	-7.0492
North Korea ’ s foreign minister said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that it would certainly not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such circumstances .	-3.6021
Ri Yong Ho said to the annual General Assembly of the World Body that North Korea took ' important goodwill ' measures last year , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear test site and the obligation not to spread nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.5091
" However , there is no response from the USA , " he said .	-2.7501
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way we first disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-6.5420
While Ri recognized the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his declaration seemed significant inasmuch as it did not completely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-11.0377
Ri referred to a joint declaration by Kim Jong-Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an official US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to working towards " denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula , " while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-3.3901
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korean war in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must first give up his nuclear weapons .	-2.7685
Washington has also opposed calls for a relaxation of the tough international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.6688
The US insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increase pressure by means of sanctions to achieve its purpose forcefully , and even reject the " declaration of the end of the war , " said Ri .	-4.0763
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-2.8372
But the problem is that the continued sanctions exacerbate our mistrust . ”	-2.0975
Ri did not mention plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President highlighted at the United Nations early this week .	-2.8405
Instead , the minister highlighted three meetings between Kim and South Korea ’ s leader , Moon Jae-in , over the last five months , and added : ' If the party were to denuclearize South Korea and not the US , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have fallen into such a deadlock ' .	-4.6207
Nevertheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year when he reported it to the U.N. ; the General Assembly targeting the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called Trump Kim a “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.4144
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ totally destroy ” North Korea last year , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.5365
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no time frame and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months ' .	-2.9506
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.3164
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN . Security Council on Thursday that ' enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without defects until we implement full , definitive and verified denuclearization ' .	-4.8287
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the funding of Pyongyang 's nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-2.6042
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly and then said he would go to Pyongyang again next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.9838
Pompeo has visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip has not been good .	-2.0706
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made , and only a few hours after that North Korea condemned him to “ passionate demands . ”	-4.0152
This month , at a Moon meeting , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex when the United States adopted ' appropriate action ' .	-8.0760
He said that Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and moves to normalize relations with Washington .	-7.5998
Harvard students participate in the course to find enough peace and quiet .	-2.6567
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students will get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying caffeined nights .	-4.4778
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.2309
Charles Cheisler , professor of sleeping medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believed to be the first of his kind in the USA .	-3.4217
He was inspired to start the course after giving a lecture about the effects of a lack of sleep on learning .	-3.1780
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is that only now , in my final year ?	-3.7460
She said that you never told anyone of the meaning of sleep – which surprised me , " he said the telegraph .	-3.8453
The course offered for the first time this year explains to students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general wellbeing .	-8.9431
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University ’ s Health Service , said that the University decided to introduce the course after it found that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-4.1632
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.0861
In a section there is a picture of a sleeping hall where students click on coffee basses , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light and how the sporting performance affects the deficiency of sleep and the meaning of a sleeping time routine .	-13.1146
Another section explains how long-term sleep departure can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression and cancer .	-3.2735
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect on their everyday lives .	-12.6030
We know that it will not change the behaviour of students immediately .	-1.5409
" But we believe they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Cheisler added .	-3.0772
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added , that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and students make sleep deprivation a growing problem .	-4.5357
Having sufficient sleep of good quality should be a student 's " secret weapon " to fight stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - even to not increase - because sleep withdrawal puts the brain into hunger mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-5.0325
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian studying chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Cheisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-3.1784
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push for a campus-wide course .	-2.3851
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all document candidates to complete a similar study programme before entering the Competition School .	-3.5554
Prof. Cheisler recommended that students alert when they should go to bed and wake up , and be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " , broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can bring their circadian rhythm out of action , causing problems in sleeping .	-5.8486
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal eradicates Gerrard ’ s Men	-1.6090
Further foreign problems with the rangers : After a meeting of Dolly Menga , Livingston came to a 1-to-0 defeat for Steven Gerrard ’ s divided team .	-4.7797
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since the 4 : 1 triumph in February in St. Johnstone , but Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games was added as a coach who left his team around eight points behind the disappointed Ladbrokes premiership chief Hearts .	-5.0412
Menga landed seven minutes before the mid-term a hit and an inspirational ranger screen didn 't look like they could compensate .	-4.8877
While the ranks are now falling back to the sixth place , Livingston climbs to three and only because of the Tordifference behind Hibernian .	-4.3586
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , since a head wound had to be supplied to line judges Calum Spence after he was hit by a litter – apparently thrown out of the foreign fans sector .	-6.1864
Gerrard made eight changes to the side that passed Ayr and swept directly to the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-3.2431
Holds the same Livi Elf that decreased the Hearts last week , and he may have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not allow opponents space for action at any time .	-5.1923
Although the Rangers dominated ball ownership , Livingston implemented opportunities better .	-3.7304
They should have met after just two minutes when Mengas first board Scott Pittman sent to Allan McGregors Gate , but the middle field player passed his big change at the gate .	-4.9313
Captain Craig Halkett went to Keaghan Jacobs , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far behind posts .	-4.4135
The rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than betrayal into their own game , in the last third .	-6.5973
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that he had earned a penalty after conflicting with Steven Lawless , but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not address the Colombian appeals .	-4.6745
The Rangers reach only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly out of peace with Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and the hit of a bitless Ovie Ejaria .	-4.8641
Although Livis may have opened the 34th minute contrary to the course of the game , no one can deny that they alone deserved it for their effor.	-5.0112
Again , the rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-1.6990
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the calm and put Menga out for a simple finish .	-3.3337
Gerrard acted during the break when he swapped Coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-3.8214
But Livingston continued to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halket swept long balls after long balls .	-3.9257
Holt ’ s team could have expanded its leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well placed to refuse Jacobs before Lithgow passed the corner .	-4.8972
The Rangers Representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to a punishment because he was devastating with Jacobs , but again he saw Thomson away .	-5.1967
According to the Geiger Counter ’ s Inventor	-3.3508
And now a page from our alman “ Sunday morning ” : September 30 , 1882 , that was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger was born in Germany .	-3.2841
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually produced the device known as the Geiger counter .	-3.2404
Since then , the Geiger counter has also become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which seems unlikely to be a Cowpoke scientist , Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-4.5242
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-1.5396
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger counter that is used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.3648
If you set up these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-2.9348
Evans : “ Tell yourself , now it is cracking but enormous ! ”	-4.0455
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , only a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.4846
But the invention that bears its name continues to be used .	-2.2058
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malicious cells .	-1.8636
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malicious cells .	-1.8980
Vaccine Teaches the Immune System to recognize malicious cells as part of treatment	-6.2628
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory	-2.3932
You can then see a protein common to many types of cancer , and then inject again .	-2.6284
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a number of cancers .	-2.7946
A woman treated with the vaccine that teaches the immune system to recognize rogue cells saw their egg-stock cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-2.9319
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many types of cancer and then reinject the cells .	-3.5188
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland said : ' Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine . '	-2.3640
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer , ” including breast , egg stock , lung and intestinal cancer , declared Prof. Berzofsky .	-2.9671
A similar approach to taking patients immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-2.3287
After his appearance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with MAGA cap , left a pro Trump tirade from the stack .	-3.1721
It Wasn ’ t Good	-1.9511
Kanye West was booked in the studio during a Saturday Night Live broadcasting after a winning speech in which he praised the US .	-4.7592
Having listed his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while carrying a Make America Great Mütze , he raised against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-9.5753
" As often as I speak to a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.8407
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America a a long time ago , " he said .	-2.6504
The Saturday Night-Live Show began with a Sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon , on Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford ’ s accusations that Kavanaugh needed them sexually .	-4.3111
Although it was not broadcast , West ’ s film material was shared by the comedian Chris Rock in the social media .	-3.3658
It is unclear whether Rock tried to mock West with the post .	-2.6306
West , too , complained to the audience that he had been hard behind the stage , because of his head cover .	-10.1399
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-1.8278
You said : ' Don 't walk with your hat . '	-3.4313
You annoyed me !	-2.1968
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington examiner .	-6.4769
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman environment , because that means you can 't tell me what to do .	-5.1552
Try it with love . ”	-0.9068
His comments were received at least twice by the audience with Buhrufen , and the comedians of Saturday Night Live seemed to be moved , reported Variety and quoted a person with the words : “ The whole studio was dead . ”	-5.0810
West was used as a later substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , had died a few days ago .	-7.5010
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , disguised as Perrier Bottle .	-2.7760
West received support from the boss of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , who twittered : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : DANKE , THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-3.7014
But Talkmaster Karen Hunter twittered that West is simply " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-2.3270

Before the show , the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now called the “ the being formally known as Kanye West ” .	-3.0174
He is not the first artist to change his name and enter the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-2.6078

The data of the three senators were published shortly after the Kavanaugh survey .	-2.7226
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identified the source of the locations was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of a Waters employee , Hill reports .	-3.9296
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” says Waters .	-2.7598
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for this information being read .	-4.1656
This unholy claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.2043
Water ’ s statement quickly led to criticism online , including the former White House Ari Fleischer press secretary .	-3.0755
“ The fact that the matter is denied is extremely annoying , ” meat wrote .	-3.4320
" This suggests that she is unsuitable as a member of Congress .	-2.8801
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.4062
They must not be raised .	-2.6356
You may not call into question the motives of the plaintiff .	-1.5777
They must be calm and let ” .	-2.8571
Meatlers seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Kavanaugh , accused by critics of appearing too angry during the consultation on Thursday .	-4.0550
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who stands in the midterm elections next to the sittless Water , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-4.0644
“ Big , if true , ” he has tweeted .	-1.7478
In her statement , Waters said that her office ' informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-3.0561

Review for " Johnny English – Live only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson	-2.4662
It is a tradition to look for suggestions in every new film with Brexit tendency , and that seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action Spoof-Franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was resumed in 2011 with Johnny English Reborn .	-5.1281
Is the ironic self-satire about humanity at the abyss the new export of the nation ?	-3.1528
In any case , the glotcycle , rubber-visible and incompetent Johnny English has received for the second time the license to re-mask things .	-4.9191
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre demands for smoothie glamour , has received a little clouseau , a Spritzer Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy , and contributed a single note to the leading car leading for the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-6.7208
It is also based on the traveller and international mysterious Atkinson , who has worked with the Barclaycard television screens that have now been forgotten , always lechaos . to , , , and , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , and , to, , , and	-14.7208
There are one or two nice moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.7063
I loved Johnny English , who approaches a helicopter in a medieval armor and shortly beats his helmet .	-3.3006
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is visible , but the humor feels quite weak and strange , especially since the " serious " movie brands like 007 and mission imposible offer comedy as an ingredient .	-4.2403
The humor feels like he is more focused on children than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean silent films .	-4.3993
The perpetual premise now is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.1603
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the high-secret British spy network and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , horrifying the service-agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.7764
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this Quasi-Teresa May figure , but there is not much in the script to work with .	-3.9272
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as every single active spy has been compromised , someone has to get out of retirement .	-3.7617
And that means the tollpatchy Johnny English himself , who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a school of rock academy on spy .	-4.9138
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former long-suffering Kumpel Bough , who is again played by Ben Miller .	-3.6437
Bough is now a married man meeting a submarine commander , an overwhelming , burchicosis role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not fully involved .	-4.4143
So the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenkos beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.6206
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister is dangerously playing the charismatic tech billionaire , claiming to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the darker Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.9808
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the colourful Highjinks : as a waiter , they inflammate a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas luxury yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas House .	-11.0493
All the registers have been drawn for this last sequence , but as lovingly and as omitted as they are , the whole thing is reminiscent of child television .	-5.0363
Moderate .	-2.3191
And , as with the other Johnny English films , I could not help thinking : can the British film industry , Rowan Atkinson , not give a role that is really fair to his talent ?	-3.8892
Labour denies to have developed a plan for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-3.1949
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan in which Britain only works four days a week but is paid for five .	-3.2958
According to reports , the Party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the revolution of artificial intelligence ( AI ) to workers by releasing them an additional day .	-3.7526
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money home .	-2.4086
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plans to overturn the country for the benefit of workers .	-3.7270
The Trade Union Congress has approved the changeover to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to take advantage of the changing econom.	-3.8744
A high-level source of the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.9568
A four-day week is a goal that is in line with the Party ’ s approach to restoring the economic balance in favour of workers and the Party ’ s general industrial strategy , but that will not be realized overnight .	-4.4859
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 campaign .	-2.1284
However , the whole Labour Party is not supporting this initiative at present .	-8.0866
A spokesman from the Labour Party said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-3.2177
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to create his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.3640
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit-makers ' in supply companies .	-2.9380
The shadow Chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current water shareholders may not receive their entire share , as a Labour government could make ' deductions ' due to alleged misconduct .	-5.4181
It also confirmed the plans to appoint workers to the management and create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of private sector equity to employees who receive up to 500 pounds per year .	-4.4606
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether the FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their minds .	-2.3003
Due to an ongoing FBI investigation into judges Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on the appointment of the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least one week , and the question is also raised as to whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead to Republican Senators abandoning their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.0701
In an interview broadcast on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” the Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham asked whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could induce them to change their minds .	-4.2095
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.2355
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.6964
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Justice Kavanaugh .	-2.2043
I called him after that happened , after that claim came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-8.2580
He was determined , targeted , clear . '	-2.4443
However , Graham 's voice seemed to be cast in stone .	-2.3657
" I have an opinion on Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb accusation , " he said .	-2.4997
“ Ford , I do not know what happened , but I know that Brett has vehemently disputed the accusation , ” Graham added with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-3.8972
" No one she called it could confirm .	-1.6575
It is 36 years ago .	-1.2016
I see nothing new that changes . '	-1.6182
" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has ensured poverty reduction ? "	-2.0672
This Saturday the Global Citizen Festival takes place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-2.9250
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people on the Great Lawn in the Central Park , not only to experience stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to draw attention to the real goal of the event : ending extreme poverty by 2030 .	-3.7187
The Global Citizen Festival that took place in 2012 is an expansion of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at fighting poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting against it .	-2.9655
In order to receive a free entrance ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteer work , e-mail to a leader in the world , a telephone call or another meaningful way of increasing the target of combating poverty and raising awareness of this .	-9.8299
But how successful has Global Citizen been at 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.1281
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real opportunity to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called ' clicktivism ' - people who feel sent by signing an online petition or an application or by sending a tweet as if they were making a real difference ?	-4.8777
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters , pushing for a variety of different targets .	-2.8937
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of over 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-2.9404
At the beginning of 2018 , Group listed 390 operations and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion have already been paid or financed .	-3.8639
The group estimates that the funds allocated to date had a direct influence on almost 649 million people around the world .	-2.9670
The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to help Rwanda with $ 35 million to end malnutrition in the country after global citizens have received more than $ 4,700 tweets . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-13.1445

The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom that were aimed at improving the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will achieve the funding of the Power of Nutrition project , 5 million women and children with food interventions .	-4.3075
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think that we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.9517
Global citizens answered : it will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-2.8110
Like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed because we are more powerful together .	-2.5943
Among other things , the stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform at this year 's New York event , moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-3.2945
US Secretary of State	-2.1026
Washington can use his navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted by Washington Examiner .	-3.0188
Zinke suggested that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria – especially in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – is a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.4842
“ I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is the following : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.4311
And , according to the officials , there are ways to circumvent it .	-3.5548
“ The United States has this ability to ensure , with our naval , that maritime paths are open and , if necessary , block to ensure that their energy does not come onto the market , ” he said .	-4.3941
Zinke spoke to the participants of an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.2194
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to dealing with Russia and Iran , and noted that they are indeed equal .	-2.6072
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is , more or less , to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he called Russia an " one-trick pony " with an economy dependent on fossil fuels .	-3.2104
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe , and to replace Russia , the much more favourable option for European consumers .	-11.6831
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to push Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that Berlin , according to Trump , would “ prisoner ” Mosco.	-3.8080
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the $ 11-billion pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic meters , is a purely economic project .	-7.1815
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.3320
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak said after a meeting with US Secretary of Energy Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-6.1731

Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need an FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-2.4751
But a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-2.6053

The lawyers of the states that support grace called El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which include a large number of asylum seekers in the US , as nations that are faced with deep problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-4.5451
The new asylum policy of the US has revoked a decision by the Chamber of Appeals for Immigrants in 2014 that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum .	-3.6947
The Justice Minister of District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-2.5881
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to German law , all asylum applications must be assessed in accordance with the circumstances of the respective complaint and that such action violates this principle .	-3.9233
Lawyers continued to argue in the writing that the policies that deny immigrants entry damage the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants become entrepreneurs and “ do necessary work . ”	-4.0484
General Prosecutor Jeff Sessions relied on immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to those fleeing domestic or gang violence .	-3.3368
“ Asylum stands for those who have to leave their home country for persecution on the basis of race , religion , nationality or membership of a particular social group or on the basis of political opinion , ” said sessions in his statement on the law of 11 June .	-4.4300

Ambassador China ’ s “ propaganda advertising ”	-3.3350
One week after an official Chinese newspaper presented a four-page display in a US daily newspaper on the mutual benefits of US trade , the US Ambassador in China accused Beijing of using the American press to spread propaganda .	-4.2296
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to the paid paper of China Daily in Des Moines Register - the state with the most sold newspaper of Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in the November 6 congressional elections , which China denies .	-4.8151
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s accusation of trying to interfere in the US elections is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-2.6388
While it is normal for foreign states to place advertisements to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.2360
At an early stage of the trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs should , according to Chinese and US experts , exporters meet in US states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.0267
Terry Branstad , American ambassador to China , and former Iowa governor , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing violated American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-2.8375
China , Branstad wrote in the Moines Register on Sunday in an article written by Branstad , “ this harassment is now pushing forward with propaganda advertisements in our own free press .	-6.2225
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid advertisement in the Des Moines Register , China ’ s government exploits its estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and press , ” Branstad wrote .	-3.8403
" By contrast , you will find limited divergent voices at the newspaper in the streets of Beijing , and see no real reflection of differences of opinion that the Chinese people may have on China ’ s disturbing economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-5.3449
He added that ' one of China 's most prominent newspapers contradicted the offer to publish ' , although he did not say which newspaper .	-2.7345
The Republicans Republicans Bury the Kavanaugh Debacle Women Electors Prior to the Midterm Election , Warning Analysts	-4.1519
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee elected to the Supreme Court , despite being accused of sexual assaults , analysts warn that they will see a retaliation in the forthcoming elections , particularly women .	-4.2276
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-2.2375
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reeher , Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-2.6457
Reeher said , he doubts that , at the last minute , support from Jeff Flake ( Republican MEP for the state of Arizona ) for investigations by the FBI is sufficient to reconcile angry voters .	-9.5306
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant , and national spokesman for the progressive MoveOn group on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-2.9694
On Friday morning , the protesters sang “ November comes ! ” while they demonstrated in the Senate ’ s corridor , when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to continue with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination , despite the statement by Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , reports Mic .	-4.8127
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , said journalists .	-1.7321
“ People say that it is quite advanced , that is true .	-3.0099
But the number could be higher , especially among the electorate in suburbs and younger voters , 18 to 29 years old , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-4.3044
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she expressed her accusations of sexual violence against the candidate for the Supreme Court , analysts noted that a backlash could follow if Republicans promoted the candidature .	-4.2977
“ This has become a confusing chaos for the GOP , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , early last week , according to NBC News .	-3.3165
“ It is not simply about the choice of committee or the final election , or whether Kavanaugh is being placed on the replacement bank ; it is about how the Republicans handled this and how they handled it , ” Guy Cecil , Director of US Priorities , a group that helps the Democrats elect , told the news station .	-6.1332
But Americans are divided about Ford and Kavanaugh .	-2.2366
A new YouGov survey shows that 41 % of respondents of Ford ’ s witness statement definitively or probably believed , while 35 % indicated that they believed definitively or probably Kavanaugh .	-4.2222
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh lied probably or definitely during his statement , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-2.6965
At the Flake initiative , the FBI is currently investigating the accusations of Ford and of at least another prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.1385

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior because of his sexuality .	-1.7797
The Olympic Diver Tom Daley says he grew up with the feeling that he had everyone lost due to his sexuality - but that gave him the motivation to be a success .	-4.5604
The 24-year-old said that he had only realized at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.3758
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 , Lauren Laverne said that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.1745
He also said that victory in the Olympic Games would have become less important for him after the birth of his first child .	-2.8763
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has freed several months due to a disease .	-10.2932
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he felt “ less worth ” as an adult than the others , because “ it was not accepted by society to stand on men and women . ”	-7.6961
He said , “ To date , these feelings of being and otherness have given me the power and strength that I needed to succeed . ”	-4.0602
He wanted to prove that he was “ something ” , he meant to disappoint nobody when he leads from his sexual orientation .	-3.8329
The two-time bronze medal winner has become a top-class LGBT activist and used his appearance at this year 's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalize homosexuality .	-2.9844
He said he had spoken because he was lucky to be able to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give other ' hope ' .	-3.3849
The three-fold World Champion said that he loved himself in love with a man , the US filmmaker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 .	-9.4631

His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 with only 40 years after a diagnosis of cancer .	-2.5784
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he had asked was whether they had their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-7.0857

The Weak Mickelson Sat at the Bank on the Ryder Cup Saturday	-2.4559
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he will have to dramatically improve his shape so that he will not be a sad milestone .	-4.1920
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.2516
Instead of focusing , as is often the case for the US , the five-times Major winner shared his day between fires and rounds in the golf course , hoping to overcome his deep .	-4.3947
The 48-year-old is never the straightest driver even at the height of his career and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square where the long Rough regularly penalises failures .	-3.6320
And as if the space alone were not already challenging enough , Mickelson meets the British Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-4.1821
If Americans lag four points behind when the 12 individual games start , Mickelson ’ s Match could be absolutely crucial .	-4.0889
Furyk expressed his confidence in his husband ; what remained untrusted .	-7.9515
" He has fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.6879
" He has a lot of confidence in him .	-2.1712
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-1.6541
I probably would not have thought he is playing two games .	-2.4004
I wanted to see more , but that is the way in which we felt we had to tackle it .	-4.7302
It wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.8992
So far , Nick Faldo holds the record for most of the matches played at the Ryder Cup .	-4.4310
This might mark the end of a Ryder Cup career that has never matched the heights of its individual record .	-3.2662
Mickelson won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times undecided , but Furyk said that his presence would have been invaluable to the team .	-3.8284
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to maintain people , and he is a great guy he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-2.9186
I think the younger players had fun this week to measure themselves with him , that was nice to see . ”	-3.6200
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.1016
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can soon disappear .	-2.3198
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the individual games of the last day can quickly become an inconvenient ride at the Ryder Cup .	-3.5228
The Dane debuted in 1997 in the Valderrama game , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points over the Americans , but only slightly over the finishing line and gained a very thin lead from 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-5.5198
" One remembers that one was in the lead in Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline where we lost .	-4.4031
History will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-1.7873
You will be bored tomorrow .	-2.3452
Go out and do the right things .	-1.1781
It is not over until the points are displayed on the table .	-2.9117
Our goal is to win this cup , and that is what we focus on .	-2.9475
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the world ’ s best players . ”	-8.9144
Enthusiastically added , as his players played on a hard golf course , " I would never be premature .	-3.5437
Tomorrow is another day .	-1.0007
Tomorrow are personal performances , and that is another thing .	-2.8682
It 's great to be there with a partner when things go well , but if you are out there alone , your own skills are tested on the whole .	-5.3902
This is the message you have to convey to the players : tomorrow you will get the best out of it .	-3.9946
Now you enter your partner and it has to do just as you are doing . ”	-4.6595
Unlike Björn , the opposing player Jim Furyk will strive for his players to do better individually than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who have raised three out of four points .	-4.2362
Furyk himself has already experienced such a sensational turning on the end of the day , and at that time he was part of the winner team in Brookline , now he is among the losers , after the European team has achieved the “ miracle of Medinah . ”	-11.9034
" I remember every damned word , " he said on the question of how Ben Crenshaw , the captain of 1999 , had gathered his players on the way to the last day .	-3.2872
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to get started as soon as possible , as you have seen in Brookline , in Medinah .	-3.4690
Once an independent dynamic has developed , there is great pressure on the middle matches .	-4.2551
We have built our site accordingly and brought the boys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-4.4110
Thomas , together with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , should lead the other European on the top places in the rankings , the retaliatory against Rory McIlroy at the top .	-4.9931
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " Bjorn said about his individual selection .	-3.0111
Renewed postponement of Germany ’ s New War Ship	-2.4692
The latest fragmentation of the German navy should have been put in service in 2014 to replace war vessels coming from the Cold War period , but it will now take at to next year , in , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-14.2155
The start-up of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the leading ship of the brand new fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , says the newspaper “ Die Zeit ” , invoking a military speaker .	-4.4331
The naval should have put the ships into operation in 2014 , but serious problems following the first delivery burdened the ambitious project .	-3.6237
The four fregates of the Baden-Württemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older Bremen vessels .	-3.1302
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of flight defence and ship defence rockets , and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.0285
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest fregates are to be used for up to two years without going to the marina .	-4.2010
However , the state-of-the-art warships that Germany should allow for overseas power projection will already be outdated by the constant delays when they are finally put into service , as the weekly newspaper “ Die Zeit ” notes .	-5.1113
Last year , the unfortunate F125 fregate caused headlines when the German navy officially refused to start the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-3.3765
This was the first time that after delivery the marine returned a ship to a shipbuilder .	-2.6195
There was little knowledge of the reasons for the return of the ships ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects , ” which would make the war ship useless in combat operations .	-4.1010
Software deficiencies were especially important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships are served by a crew of around 120 sailors - only half of the crew on older Bremen class frigates .	-4.5253
It also proved that the ship had a considerable overweight , which would restrict performance and make it more difficult for future upgrades to the navy .	-4.7117
It is assumed that the 7,000 tonne “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans during World War II . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.7251
In addition to incorrect hardware , the price sign of the entire project - including crew training - becomes a topic .	-3.9757
Instead of the EUR 2.2 billion originally estimated , the cost has now apparently reached the dizzying level of EUR 3.1 billion ( approximately $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.3106
The problems with the latest fregates are given particular significance in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s maritime power is disappearing .	-4.1533
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament admitted that the war fleet actually “ goes out of operational ships . ”	-3.6685
The official said that the problem has grown avalanche over time , as old ships have been left out of service without replacing it .	-4.9804
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg fregates were served by the navy .	-2.9826
The National Trust explains the secret life of bats .	-2.6958
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands attempts to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-3.2484
It is hoped that this will provide new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals , which can guide future animal protection measures .	-3.7503
The study by scientists at the National Trust for Scotland will follow common soprano pistrels and brown long and dubenton bats at the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross .	-4.3560
Special reception equipment is placed at the main points of the accommodation to track bats activities throughout the season .	-3.7212
NHS employees and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-1.8575
An expert sound analysis of all pictures determines the frequency of bats calls and classifies the calls to species .	-3.7981
The habitat card to be created and the accompanying report should give a detailed overview of the behaviors .	-3.5950
Rob Dewar , the National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) Nature Conservation Adviser hopes to find out what areas of the habitat are most important for the bats and how they are used by the species .	-4.7358
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management , how best to maintain meadows and forests for bats and other related species .	-3.6183
The bats in Scotland and the UK as a whole have declined sharply over the past centuries .	-3.4095
They are threatened by construction works affecting their sleeping places and loss of habitat .	-2.9343
Wind power plants and lighting can also pose a risk , as can fly pencil strips and some chemical treatments of building materials , and attacks by house cats also play a role .	-5.5398
Bats are not actually blind .	-1.9115
Adapted to their night hunting activities , the ears are more useful than the eyes .	-3.9257
They use sophisticated echo location technology to locate errors and obstacles on their flight .	-3.2199
The NTS , which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings , 38 major gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-2.6681
There are ten trained experts who carry out regular surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes carry out rescues .	-3.2595
The organization has even set up Scotland 's first and only dedicated bats reserve in the thread estate in Dumfries and Galloway , where eight of the ten Scottish bats are home to .	-4.0500
According to David Thompson , property is an ideal habitat for them :	-1.9027
“ Here in Threade we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.9327
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.2255
But there is still a lot of unknown about bats and the work that we do here and on other places helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.6229
He emphasises that it is important to check , before maintenance work in buildings , whether bats are there , according to which it is possible that , in the unwittingly destroying a single sleeping place , up to 400 females and boys , a whole local population may be erased .	-6.1633
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill them , to harass or disturb them and to destroy their sleeping places .	-2.8260
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish staff at Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.7578
She said , “ We still have a lot to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.7865

Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are preparing a complaint against the “ Der Spiegel ” magazine for allegations ; according to Reuters , you talked about “ inadmissible reporting of privacy suspects . ”	-4.7633
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for “ intangible damage in the amount of serious injury that is probably one of the most serious infringements of personality rights in recent years . ”	-4.4763
The alleged incident was due to have taken part in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.8854
According to documents submitted to the District Court of Clark County in the U.S. state of Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga moved back to the room of the player when they were raped eventually .	-5.0972
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo was on his knees after the supposed incident , saying he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy , ” left in the lurch by “ one percent . ”	-4.9475
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had sex , but it was agreed .	-2.0325
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had " fear of retaliation " and worried about " public humiliation " .	-4.5633

Brexit – Britain ’ s Forever Regret to Lose Car Manufacturers	-3.0011
“ The United Kingdom would regret it in time if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economic Secretary Greg Clark .	-3.1993
He added that it was ' worrying ' that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their factory in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.2131
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.1759
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the effects of delays at borders in the event of no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-2.9902
Last year , the Burnaston plant , which manufactured the Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.0212
“ If Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I think it will come to production stops at our plant , ” said Marvin Cooke , Chairman of the Executive Board at Toyota in Burnaston .	-3.6410
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears about leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.7744
BMW , for example , has already announced that it will close its work in Oxford for a month after Brex.	-2.1511
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of ' no deal Brexit ' .	-2.9863
The Toyota production facilities are based on demand-oriented manufacturing , i.e. the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the UK and the EU for special production .	-4.6278
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border , which , according to industry , can lead to delivery shortages and partial shortages .	-3.6365
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of the stock at his plant in Derbyshire , the company said , and so production would be stopped .	-8.0914
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU is ‘ exactly calibrated to avoid these controls on the border . ’ , , , , , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.9468
We must have a deal ; we want the best deal that not only allows us to succeed but also to seize this opportunity , ” he said the Today programme of BBC Radio 4 .	-4.6403
“ The reference not only from Toyota , but also from other manufacturers , is that we must be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ” , .	-9.3276
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stop might take , but warned that the cost increase in the long term could suffer the competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-8.6252
Peter Tsouvalaris , trade union representatives , and for 24 years in Burnaston , said that trade union members were increasingly concerned : “ I have experience that once they have been cut , jobs are lost forever . ”	-4.4912

Trump ’ s Meeting with Rosenstein could postpone again , says the White House	-2.3751
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with the Deputy Prosecutor General Rod Rosenstein could “ be postponed another week ” as the fight for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-3.6784
Rosenstein oversees the work of the special adviser , Robert Mueller , who examines Russian interventions in the elections , the ties between Trump and Russia , and the possible impediment to the president ’ s justice .	-4.1992
Whether or not Trump will fire the Deputy Prosecutor General , and so that Müller ’ s independence is threatened , Washington has brought a lot of collapse for months .	-4.7519
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump , making it possible to remove the president from the 25th addition to the constitution .	-3.7104
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.2694
But last Monday he came to the White House , while reports hailed that he was about to resign .	-3.0018
Instead , a meeting with Trump , who was then at the United Nations in New York , was announced on Thursday .	-2.2341
Trump said he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but subsequently the meeting was delayed to avoid a collision with the Senate ’ s Justice Committee in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-9.4518
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of Kavanaugh ’ s claims and continued to delay a full Senate vote .	-2.6040
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman , Sarah Sanders , was on Fox News on Sunday .	-1.8956
After the Rosenstein meeting , she said : " A date has not yet been set that it could be this week , I could see that I return another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-4.9609
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-2.4901
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a White House press conference since September 10 .	-2.3695
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.1330
Sanders said that the lack of briefings was not a reluctance to television television reporters , who behaved like self-performers , but he also said : ' I will not oppose them in the gallery ' .	-5.6524
She then suggested that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.8186
" The President carried out more questions and answers than any president before him , " she said and added , without any evidence , " We have looked at these figures . "	-4.6830
Briefings will still take place , said Sanders , but the press should have the opportunity to ask the President of the United States the questions directly , that is infinitely better than to talk to them .	-4.0661
We are trying to do a great deal of that , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press conversation when you can talk to the President of the United States itself . ”	-4.1583
Trump answers regularly questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.3112
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.1035
In New York , perhaps this week , the president showed why by making a free and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-3.4648

Scottish MEPs Jane Freeman wrote letters less than 6 months before Britain left the EU .	-2.7749
The Scottish Government has agreed to incorporate the costs of agreed status applications for EU citizens working in its decentralised public service .	-7.9423
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : “ During the summer , negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU continued on withdrawal , steadily on expected decisions in the autumn .	-3.4188
But the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-1.9556

Foreign buyers will be charged a higher stamp tax when buying property in Britain - the additional money will be used for the homeless , Theresa May announces today .	-3.3900

The stamp fee is applied to people and businesses who do not pay taxes in the UK , and the additional money will help the government to combat homelessness .	-3.6279

“ Creating it is not an easy task , but I would probably only consider it successful if I can bring the club back there . ”	-4.2015

Pub and Bar groups experienced a 2.7 percent sales plus in July , but restaurant revenue fell 4.8 percent , according to the figures .	-4.2788
Peter Martin , from the CGA consultancy compiling the figures , said : " Sustained sunshine and England longer than expected continued participation in the World Cup led to July following a similar pattern to June last month , when pub visits rose by 2.8 % , only that restaurants were even more affected .	-5.4608

It is not surprising that restaurant groups remain under pressure , although a 4.8 percent decline in sales will be particularly painful compared to the last year ’ s continuing cost pressure .	-4.2950
The long hot summer would not have been worse for food operators , and time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed break .	-4.1429

Milk pump advertising , where mothers are compared with cows , led to controversial online discussions	-2.3862
A milk pump company has caused controversial online discussions because of a notification that compares breastfeeding mothers with cows .	-4.1328
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " first noiseless and portable milk pump worldwide " , the consumer technology company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.4338
Four real mothers dance in a witch in the midst of cows containing a number with the following song text : " Yes , I milk me , but you see no tail " and " If you have not noticed that they are not euters , they are my breasts " .	-5.5296
The slogan continues : " Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I melt my ladies . "	-4.9584
However , the display published on the Facebook page of the company has made controversy online .	-3.1786
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from spectators , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy economy .	-3.4943
'It is a very bad decision to promote this product with cows ' .	-2.6014
Like us , they must become pregnant and give birth to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days after the birth , " wrote a person .	-3.9000
The Elvie Milk Pump fits inconspicuously in a Still-BH ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-11.6041
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.7350
But why should we not promote with them a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.8318
Someone else added : ' such an outside advertising ' .	-2.6815
Others defended advertising , including a woman who admitted that she found the song “ urkomic ” .	-2.6117
I think that is a great idea .	-1.2574
I would have obtained one if I had still made .	-3.1630
Through pumping I felt just like a cow .	-2.4028
The display is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.1254
This is a brilliant product " wrote one person .	-2.0982
Another commented : " This is a funny advertising for mothers who pump ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-3.0168
That is not advertising that praises or judges the dairy farming . '	-2.3666
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all danced with the decent pumps in their bras .	-2.5413
The concept of the campaign is based on the recognition that many women pumping milk say that they feel like cows .	-2.1713
However , the Elvie Pump is completely noisy , has no wires or hoses and fits inconspicuously into a silent bra , making women free to move , keep their babies , and even go out of their pumps .	-5.6641
Ana Balarin , Partner and ECD at Mother commented : " The Elview pump is such a revolutionary product that deserves bold and provocative launch .	-2.9005
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges while demonstrating , in an entertaining and comparable way , the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.0968

Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved to a camp on the Texas border .	-2.4139
The number of imprisoned children with a migratory background increased , although monthly border crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-3.4796
Traditionally , most of the sponsors themselves have been undocumented immigrants , fearing that they will be referred to when they advocate a child .	-3.9839
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprint and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-6.3195
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , told Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-2.5399
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.5973
" Almost 80 % of the sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and much of them are criminal alien .	-4.3162
" So we continue to pursue these people , " said Albence .	-2.6799
In an effort to process applications for children more quickly , the officials introduced new rules requiring some of them to appear before the court within a month of the detention , and not after 60 days what was the previous standard , according to the staff of the accommodation .	-5.1169
Many will appear not personally , but via video telephone to argue for legal status at an immigration judge .	-3.9351
Those who do not qualify for discharge will be deported quickly .	-2.9735
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely they are to be feared or depressed , which can lead to violent eruptions or attempts to escape .	-3.1476
Advocates said that these concerns are being reinforced in a larger institution such as Tornillo , where signs that a child is struggling are rather overlooked because of its size .	-4.5825
They added that moving children to the center , without enough time to prepare them emotionally or abandon them from friends , could worsen a trauma that many already fight with .	-4.3669

Foreign Secretary Walid al-Moualem also called before the UN General Assembly for Syrian refugees to return home , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-3.1755
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil on the pretext of fighting terrorism , and “ they will deal with it accordingly . ”	-3.5147
“ They must withdraw immediately , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.2054
Moualem claimed that “ the war on terror is nearly over ” in Syria , with over 360,000 people died in the country since 2011 , millions more driven out of their homes .	-3.8372
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence . ”	-2.6784
The US has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria ; mainly training and advising both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.0104
France has used more than 1,000 soil soldiers in the war-destroyed country .	-2.9658
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for return were in order , and he accused “ fueling some Western countries irrational fears , ” leading refugees to keep away .	-9.5823
“ We called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate return , ” says Moualem .	-2.1294
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-1.4727
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid to Syria if there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition on ending the war .	-3.6276
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel high Idlib creates the opportunity to move forward political talks .	-4.0113
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Syrian troops supported by Russia on the province where three million people live .	-2.6221
However , Moualem emphasised that the agreement claims “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra Front linked to Al Qaeda , which will “ be eliminated . ”	-8.9121
UN envoy , Staffan de Mistura , hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee from members of government and opposition to design a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.3608

Lamb opposes another official , the Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which is significantly overlapping with the new 17th .	-4.0324

But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador , which received an estimated $ 140 million in American aid in 2017 , including stun controls , development , and economic support .	-2.6255

Bond ’ s daughter Karen Jankel , who was born shortly after the adoption of the book , said about the letter : It ’ s hard to be able to read it before the release for the first time .	-3.6400
“ It is very amusing – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-1.9831
She said her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman , and was inspired to write a children ’ s book from a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected , adding that the 60th anniversary of book publication after his death was “ bitterly sweet ” last year .	-4.5447

The FBI investigations have begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-1.7939
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for - an investigation limited to time and scale - we could perhaps achieve a little unanimity , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday , adding that he feared that the committee would “ disintegrate into a deep-rooted party political blockade . ”	-5.6911
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican supporters not want the FBI to determine ?	-2.0356
Their restraint is simply due to the timing .	-2.1077
Until the midterm elections , it is only five weeks , on 6 November , so far – if Republicans do badly , as expected , they will be greatly weakened in trying to promote the man who wants to be elected to the country ’ s highest court .	-5.3362

The North Korean Republic Number Down under Kim	-2.2604
The number of North Korean overrunners into South Korea has fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korean Member said .	-3.1204
According to data from the Ministry of South Assembly , Park Byeong-victory indicated that last year 1,127 were fidelity – compared to 2,706 in 2011 .	-5.2017
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in prices for human traffickers play a crucial role in this .	-3.2144
Pyongyang has not spoken publicly .	-1.7944
Finally , the majority of people from North Korea receive South Korean citizenship .	-2.6973
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans have crossed the border illegally since the end of the Korean War in 1953 .	-1.8864
Most flee over China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the strictly guarded demilitarized zone between North and South Korea .	-2.3376
China views the overlappers as illegal migrants , not refugees , and often brings them back forced .	-3.0965
Relations between the North and the South , which are formally still in war , have improved significantly in recent months .	-2.7499
Earlier this month , the leaders of both countries met in Pyongyang to talk about the frozen negotiations on denuclearization .	-2.6125

Nancy Pelosi describes Brett Kavanaugh as hysterical and says that he is unsuitable for the Supreme Court service	-3.0482
The Chairman of the Democratic Minority Group , Nancy Pelosi , called Brett Kavanaugh , the candidate for a seat at the Supreme Court “ hysterical , ” saying that he was inappropriate from the temperament to serve the Supreme Court .	-3.6642
Pelosi made the comments on an interview Saturday at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.2232
“ I could not think otherwise that if a woman had ever behaved like this , they would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-3.4075
Kavanaugh denied the claims emotionally that he had attacked Dr. sexually , Christine Blasey Ford when they were both young people .	-3.5305
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he almost wrote and fighted with the tears when he spoke about his family and high-school years .	-3.3618
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated call murder campaign ” organized by liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-3.3537
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh ’ s statement that he could not serve before the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against democrats .	-3.5009
“ I believe that he himself disqualifies himself with such statements and the way he can be influenced by the Clintons and the Democrats , ” she said .	-3.0531
When it was asked whether , in the event of its confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , it would seek an official theft procedure against Kavanaugh , Pelosi was hesitant .	-4.7450
“ I want to say the following : if he does not tell the truth to the Congress or the FBI , he is not only inappropriate for the Supreme Court , but also for the service at the Court at which he is currently busy , ” Pelosi said .	-5.1073
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. Appeal Court .	-2.0602
Pelosi added that she , as a democrat , is concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , as he stands for conservative justice .	-3.1882
In his confirmation hearings , Kavanaugh avoided questions as to whether he would overturn certain decisions of the Supreme Court .	-3.3996
“ It is not time for a hysterical , biased person to go to the court and expect us to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” Pelosi said .	-3.6898

" We cry when we become angry , " Mrs Steiner said to me 45 years later .	-2.3405
'I do not think that this is unusual , or ? '	-1.9282
She continued , “ Once helped me a woman in the executive who told me that she was also crying when she was angry , but she developed a technique in which she started to weep every time she was angry and angry , to the person she spoke to : “ You may think that I am sad because I cry .	-9.4594
I am angry . '	-1.4955
And then she simply continued .	-1.7391
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.0468
Transfers are permitted as a valve for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-3.2336
One of my strongest memories of an early job in an office dominated by men , where I once wept with indescribable anger , was that I was packed at the neck by an older woman , a blight manager before which I was always somewhat afraid - who dragged me into a staircase .	-5.3458
" Let them never see you cry , " she told me .	-2.1361
" They do not know that you are angry .	-1.7489

Someone called it ' snowwitching and the seven dwarves ' . '	-3.2642
Because the campaign was in progress long ago , it was lagging behind with the budget , and so she swore that she would not participate in the race unless she collected $ 2 million .	-4.4152
It was a lost battle .	-6.2003
She found that some of her followers who gave $ 1,000 to men would give only $ 250 .	-3.0572
“ Do you think that I receive advance praise ? ” she wondered .	-4.3363
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratefulness to the people who supported her , frustration about the system that made it so difficult to collect money and to address voters rather than delegates - and anger about sexism - that she was nipped .	-4.6927
“ One might think I had a nervous breakdown , ” Schroeder reminds us of how the press reacted to it .	-3.9976

China is responding to any blow by the US , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second largest economy will succumb in the near future .	-3.5990
Bringing Washington down means giving in to demands , but publicly bowing to the United States would be far too blammable for Xi Jinping , China ’ s president .	-4.5566
But if Beijing takes advantage of its opportunities correctly , the trade war with the US can have a positive effect on China in the long term by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies , say experts .	-3.9442
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in either country is much more dangerous than observers previously assumed , ” said Abigail Grace , scientific staff at the Center for New American Security , a think factory with Asia ’ s focus .	-3.1566
