Gut : More Safety for Pedestrians	-3.1883
They are less than 100 meters from each other : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian ampel at the village car park was opened in Gutach - in view of the older city hall ampels .	-5.8680
Two plants so close to each other : intention or circumference ?	-3.8855
Gutach 's mayor answered this question clearly yesterday .	-2.0380
" The town hall ampel was installed at the time because it secures the school path " , explained Eckert yesterday .	-3.1949
The club traffic lights safeguard both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain residents .	-3.6209
The facility officially opened yesterday is important for the intersection of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-3.0452
We have the museum , two churches , a spa park , a bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as a traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.3541
" At the high level of traffic and pedestrian traffic , another traffic light had to be safeguarded " , says Eckert .	-4.5925
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold from Offenburg .	-2.5393
" According to current measurements , on the B 33 , about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach , about ten percent of which are heavy goods vehicles , " emphasises Arnold .	-8.1987
Therefore , the construction of another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is simply going ahead here " , says Arnold .	-4.3098
A total of four traffic shows had been carried out , and a roundabout was also thought of , though because of the narrowness in the crossroads of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-5.9160
According to Arnold , in the choice of traffic lights , everything was tested : " By means of an extra long wooden tribe of loaded transporters we have established whether these vehicles can exit the Sulzbach track to the B 33 without knicking the traffic light masts " .	-12.3192
The around 15 000 Euro expensive traffic light system itself is the " most modern thing is currently available on the market " explained Arnold .	-4.5990
The complex is equipped with coloured LEDs , which are so powerful that the lights of drivers are easy to see , for example , in the case of deep sunshine .	-6.1972
It is also economical : the older light systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-4.2453
There are three light systems per direction .	-2.2556
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.6322
Pressing the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic position . a of the . , , , and , , , , , , , , ,	-10.7105
If the road is free , the green comes immediately for the pedestrian if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.3882
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be finished .	-2.4876
" Should a group or disabled people go over the road , the green phase is extended , so everyone comes safely through the railway , " explained Arnold .	-4.8394
Of course , the drivers must join in with us as partners and watch the train .	-5.6086
This was not the case yesterday : few showed the traffic lights for pedestrians green , a top class vehicle rushed through - with bright red .	-4.3659
Josef Winkler has written the hardship of his childhood and youth for more than 30 years .	-2.5394
The Carinthian poet has often described the catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - language loss , the slope to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the narrowness and joylessness . of the of , , , , , and , of course , , the , of , , , , , , , ,	-11.4950
The winner of the Buchner Prize is known mainly as a prosa author , theatre texts are rare in his work .	-5.2189
Collage from prosatextes Gerhard Fresacher puts together a collage of prosacts for his performance " Weather lights on the tongue top " , which can now be seen in Garage X at Peter Square .	-6.6634
The theatre maker combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Beigene " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " Leichnam , his family lurking " ( 2003 ) .	-4.4613
On the largely empty stage - important requisite : a crumbled sofa which is suggested to be copulated and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is hangled through the text material .	-4.6785
Director Fresacher seems little to trust the text .	-2.6259
The 70-minute performance overlooks the template with a wealth of direction incidents known from the repertoire of post-dramatic game forms .	-4.5169
Actors , especially in the sometimes questionable scenic implementations , get involved .	-5.7225
They are touched hard , dived with their head under water , taken to the wall with their evening robes .	-4.9392
Imposed in cellophane or rent , they stock on dangerously high stocks due to the staging , either monologize loudly or are completely silenced on the stage floor .	-5.6505
However , the text does not convey any message in this effort .	-3.2817
The best moments is the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to popular sunshine .	-3.8286
Only towards the end of the performance is something to calm , and Winkler 's absurd humor is bound to occur .	-11.4620
A blackbox in the car ?	-1.3115
American street planners are looking for a source of money to repair the decaying highway system , and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in the dark board of each car .	-4.6950
The devices that record each kilometre driven and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and state planning offices to revise the obsolete system of funding for US roads .	-4.3061
The normally rather boring area of road planning has suddenly sparked an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-3.4684
Libertarians have joined environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record driven kilometres – and possibly where they were driven – and then use the information to calculate tax models .	-4.5146
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.0332
The American Citizens ' Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and raises a number of data protection concerns .	-2.3731
But , while Congress cannot agree on an approach , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.9122
They are currently examining how they can change over the next decade to a system where drivers pay for each mile dri. the and the .	-5.8295
Thousands of drivers have already tested the tachographs , some of which have GPS monitoring .	-2.3690
That really is a must for our country .	-1.6866
“ It is nothing that we will only probably use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record the driven miles in all California drivers in the state from 2025 .	-4.3494
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.2850
The technology for this is there .	-1.4557
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from the taxes that US Americans pay on the column , has failed .	-3.4074
But , in America , there is no longer as much fuel as be.	-7.4382
Cars use less petrol .	-1.5028
Public oil taxes of 18.4 cents per gallone ( less than 4 Eurocents per litre ) have not increased for 20 years .	-8.9448
Politicians , at high injection prices , do not dare to raise taxes by just one cent .	-3.0738
“ The tax on petrol is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-7.7929
Its state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-3.1269
“ That is the most long-term alternative , ” he said .	-2.3534
Bureaucrats call it a mile-based user fee .	-2.3129
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging emissions are reduced .	-4.2011
The Californian planners focus on the system in drawing up strategies aimed at achieving the federal state ’ s ambitious , statutory goals on climate change .	-4.1512
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also said that he is the most viable long-term alternative .	-3.2292
The Reason Foundation ’ s free marketers also have the idea of paying drivers after travelling .	-4.2237
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President of Reason ’ s Directives .	-2.3444
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.3359
The movement is also supported by two previous American Transport Ministers , who in a 2011 report called on Congress to move toward mile-based accounts .	-3.2160
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project that would have included 10,000 cars .	-2.2367
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move and responded to the concerns of rural Members representing people who often have to take many miles to work or to the city in everyday life .	-5.0540
Nevertheless , several states and large cities are moving in that direction .	-2.7219
Most committed is Oregon , which currently holds 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s large, for .	-9.8939
These drivers will soon pay mileage charges to the state , instead of the oil tax .	-8.8067
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.9531
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-1.9132
Illinois tests it limited with trucks .	-2.0224
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the traffic ministries of 17 states on the eastern coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is examining how to introduce the change .	-6.2092
The concept is not a universal hit .	-1.0025
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with equipment , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-3.3005
“ Big Brother ’ s concerns and such things were a major problem , ” says Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Result Management at the Transport Ministry of Nevada .	-3.2060
People did not want it .	-0.8055
When the test arrived , the Nevada ACLU warned : “ It would be relatively easy to turn tachographs into adult monitoring devices . ”	-4.1516
There is no need to build a huge , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-2.7985
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology to enable the state to capture driven kilometres , but not exactly when and where .	-4.1476
Khan argues that the public would be more reassured .	-3.3038
Hunting for this technology has led to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.2116
The company initially did not start to help states tax drivers .	-2.8065
Rather , its aim was to take a foothold in an emerging market for motor vehicle insurance , in which drivers should pay on the basis of driven miles .	-5.3884
But the equipment they test is also interesting for street planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is uploaded regularly by modem .	-4.3876
“ People are more willing to participate in it when their speed and locations are not recorded , ” explained Ryan Morrison , True Mileage ’ s managing director .	-3.6620
Some of these public pilot programs have made huge mistakes .	-2.2341
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of implementing this .	-2.1190
In Oregon the planners experiment with giving drivers a variety of choices .	-2.7736
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.5956
Or they do not choose any equipment at all and instead pay a flat charge based on the average miles driven by all the residents of the state .	-10.0847
Other places hope to sell the concept of a suspicious public by giving the devices more functionality than with less .	-6.5298
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a taxation device that also pays parking fees , pays only for dangerous kilometres , and collects speed data from other vehicles in real time , thanks to which drivers can avoid congestion .	-5.0188
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages offered by the system , ” says a city planning document .	-3.5455
However , some transport planners wonder whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge distraction manoeuvre .	-8.2835
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the territory of the San Francisco Bay , officials declared that Congress could solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund simply by raising fuel tax .	-3.3101
An additional unique fee or an annual charge could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little petrol , so that they too pay a fair share .	-3.6722
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , Head of Legislation and Public Affairs of the Commission .	-3.0761
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers worry about their privacy and many other things .	-2.2517
Royal Field : Small Team Beats Wacker	-2.4742
The volunteer fire brigade covered her autumn sample despite shortages of personnel with Bravour .	-4.6900
Only eleven man took part in the exercise .	-1.6639
Department commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property feather in Burgberger Stra<unk>e in his exercise .	-3.8069
A short circuit was created when sawing .	-3.0498
Two people were injured due to the fire and smoking development that emerged , but one of them could still send an emergenc.	-4.5404
Following the first review of the facts by Hans Kammer , two breathing forces of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building . the of , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.9659
After a short period of time , it was possible to find the first person and to lead the free .	-4.3191
The second person had to be worn .	-0.9820
This was not so easy as there was a narrow staircase to overcome .	-4.7845
The building , a workshop with integrated stable for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.3171
Much wood and straw balls were stored in it .	-2.5506
There were also electric woodworking machines .	-2.6620
The first delete attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.4188
A further line was conducted via an overflower hydrant at about 100 meters distance .	-4.5705
Now three extinguishing attacks could be designed .	-2.6161
In addition , a hollow tube was used in the building .	-4.4368
Hans Kammerer was also concerned with showing what to do with little staff available .	-4.8413
In case of emergency , support is provided through the Königsfeld group .	-4.4219
The commander was satisfied with the expiry of the exercise .	-2.4248
Interconnecting universities and firms	-3.2450
On his visit to the county of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald , Landtag President Guido Wolf could also be informed in Titsee-Neustadt about where the workers will come from tomorrow .	-5.7045
He followed this important question in the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum , together with the Managing Directors ' School Managers and the Kreisgymnasium and the Chairman of the Parent Advisory Council .	-9.6203
" Education is an important location " , underlined Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , which presented the networked educational centre Hochwarzwald .	-8.0230
Wolf was impressed by the training model projects .	-2.7195
Since 2011 , there has been successful cooperation between the Federal Centre , Kreisgymnasium and the Professional School Centre in the Forest City .	-4.3370
He also praised the family-friendliness in the county .	-6.3200
" It is important not only to look at the family phase , but also the phase of caring for relatives due to demographic change , " Wolf explained .	-4.0867
He also indicated that more and more employees were concerned about the care and care of their relatives .	-3.7223
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees may lead to an end to the employment relationship , " Wolf said .	-3.9585
But no one could afford to lose skilled workers , he continued to say .	-2.3151
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.3404
" Because whoever knew the region 's benefits during his studies remains , with his acquired knowledge and skills , often preserving the regional economy , which helps to strengthen the region , " the president of the country was convinced .	-6.4228
Only if there are sufficient training places available can skilled workers be met .	-4.5468
In his opinion , the location advantage of the county is its convenient location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.4103
In addition , on his railway journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to develop public transport .	-3.9042
" Stay stubborn and ensure that public transport is improved , " he declared to the address of the local politicians present .	-3.8469
Experienced Afternoon with Music	-2.6653
The Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cakes and then to a vesper for 15 years .	-9.0070
In the past , the older fellow citizens were farmed in the restaurant .	-3.1826
This afternoon is taking place in the St. Josef care secret .	-3.2139
The inhabitants looked forward to the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.7414
Later there was a sausage salad .	-2.5987
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with common melodies .	-3.2921
The 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front definition of the old school courtyard to the church road is to be replaced with the rehabilitation cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-6.0452
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angle wall was built in the first work of the refurbishment of the front school court , for stabilisation and static discharge of the more than one hundred years old natural stone wall with balustrade .	-5.6162
The following procedure , according to Alexander Misok of the Bräunlinger Stadtbau Office , includes the National Monument Office in the planning and a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .	-6.3907
Then a cost calculation is to be carried out by specialists , which will then be put on the table to the Municipal Council for the decision and definition of the further action .	-6.1047
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-1.8882
After the renovation , plastering and tree planting of the old school court within the two sides of the school built in 1912 , in the foreseeable future as a follow-up measure , the needy border wall must be refurbished from scratch to new construction .	-6.2544
The historic , one-hundred years old delimitation wall of the old school court to the church road , is mainly due to water and frost damage , because there is no drainage , needs to be renovated and has a signature forward .	-5.9496
Deep cracks in individual stones show weather damage , but the wall is not currently at risk of collapse .	-3.5061
A stable wall is a prerequisite for a school court used by students , which is done through the current fortification work .	-4.8178
Originally , the school farm was already planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high unscheduled expenditure delayed .	-4.5958
An important word in the historical renovation of schools , which has even been used for film recordings , will be included in the National Monument Office .	-4.9955
Should requirements come from this site , the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monuments protectors .	-4.8231
The students of the Bräunlinger Primary School , who are again taught in a well-renovated old school building with new aula , can soon use the old school court .	-4.6453
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz training in Stuttgart	-1.9354
In the ongoing discussions on the future of music colleges in Baden-Württemberg , Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now taken on board .	-4.3515
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Stuttgart Academy of Music , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.1153
Jazz and classic belong just together at the jazz location Stuttgart .	-3.2705
This is contrary to <unk>zdemir , who in Stuttgart is regarded as a favorite for a direct mandate at the German election on September 22 , the Green Red Government .	-4.0263
On the basis of an expert study , this forces a reorganisation of the five music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.8661
The Stuttgart University of Music is to be relocated to the Mannheim University of Music .	-6.2374
Discovered the US Border : Super Tunnel to Drug Strafficking	-2.7285
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and closed a super tunnel to drug smuggling .	-2.9236
As the US customs authorities have said , the more than 500 metres long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks , and ventilation .	-8.1797
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.0197
According to the statements , the tunnel was . of .	-9.4395
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar , " said the General Prosecutor of the US District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a camp in San Diego , where it had discovered an end to the tunnel .	-4.5300
Duffy said to drug gangs : " If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make this a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.4602
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in a permanent fight against the drugs cartels .	-2.2833
Since 2006 , more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.3226
Constructed by experts	-1.1479
Due to the expensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the construction took approximately one year .	-4.0845
The rail system was equipped in such a way that electrically operated cars could be used there .	-3.7615
On the Mexican side , access is in a building that is 80 meters from the border .	-3.0358
According to the authorities , a head of 20 meters leads to the depth of the actual tunnel .	-3.5704
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 metres height and 90 centimetres width . of . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8548
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States .	-3.0950
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-1.3274
The third , a Mexican , was cast on account of the confiscated marih.	-7.4057
As civil servants have said , all three three threaten to be a maximum sentence of life. , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.8570
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , as was stated at the press conference in San Diego .	-2.4984
However , it is the first time that cocaine has been found in such a tunnel construction .	-8.6584
Normally cocaine is smuggled in small quantities , not through tunnels .	-2.3205
This demonstrates the " despair " of drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said Bill Sherman of the drug farming DEA in San Diego .	-4.1475
They would do everything to get to the US .	-1.3854
No details were announced to those arrested , at least one being Mexican , said .	-3.0774
They have to count on prison sentences up to ten years .	-2.8576
In 2014 , Geisinger ’ s Festival	-3.1333
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-1.7916
The recurrence of the first mention is coming ever closer .	-4.0400
When the year ends in good eight weeks , the anniversary is up .	-3.8766
Hospitals and church houses were first mentioned in recent years .	-4.4809
A certificate was made in churches where both places are mentioned .	-2.5267
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently has no hall , this kick-start will take place in the place where both were first mentioned 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-5.0860
During the anniversary several events are planned in both hospitals and church houses .	-3.6991
Church houses will be held in July at a festive weekend from July 18th to 20th July 1250 .	-4.4246
Return .	-1.6082
On Friday with a festive act , on Saturday and Sunday , with a festival around the Church hall .	-10.3121
This festive weekend is also the church house festival .	-3.4651
Municipal Music Director Rudolf Barth has written an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary which is performed on three dates .	-4.1479
On June 21st together with the Sonnwendfeier of the Black Forest Association , on July 12th in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13th as the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-4.8807
This will be completed and inaugurated during the anniversary , the official appointment is on the last September weekend , 27 and 28 September .	-3.9443
On the occasion of the Geising city anniversary a new chronic will also be released .	-3.6752
" But a chronic not only of hostages itself , but also a printed work about the hostage of today , which consists of hostages , church houses , body houses , aulfing and goutmadings , " says Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-6.4918
And today ’ s visitors celebrate 2014 birthday , in 1974 today ’ s space was completed with communities .	-3.6108
The new chronicle will be presented at the new Festhalle in Geisingen on November 21 or 22 .	-3.1476
However , 2014 is also another year with many anniversaries .	-2.5405
The foodstuff Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a traditional anniversary on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the harmony Gutmadingen will be 90 years and has the festival banquet on 29 March and then celebrates the music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-6.1297
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on 10 May , the music association Polyhymnia Leipferdingen will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Wellness Festival from 4 to 7 July .	-5.0485
The town of Geisingen was first mentioned in a donation document owned by the monastery of St. Gallen in 764 .	-3.5184
The certificate was made in churches ( houses ) , which was then court .	-3.0723
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.2858
The reason for celebrating this 1250-year-old in 2014 is 40 years ago .	-4.7182
The Council is targeting track plants	-7.9380
Should the railway transfer " Am Hirschen " be complex to improve road safety ?	-7.8028
Yes , the local councils have decided .	-1.9565
Shiltach must take over EUR 220 000 for this .	-3.2397
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal railway line next year .	-7.1855
The aim is to increase safety at rail transfers - regularly there are collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout the country .	-4.7508
If communities agree to reconstruction measures , they must participate with a third in the costs , the rest share track and federation .	-5.5401
Schiltach 's master town building master Roland Griedhaber explained to the council the specificities of the railway crossing " Am Hirschen " .	-4.6993
There , the city plans to build a book-out in the amount of the tunnel little west of the railway track .	-6.4840
There , too , larger vehicles , such as those transporting long wood , could stand at counter-traffic without having to block the track .	-4.1568
Greeholders therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could spread the subsequent road in due course to ensure a smooth flow of transport .	-5.3837
This was discussed controversially in the municipal councils , as some Councils questioned the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , pointed out the critics ' mood : ' Do we have to take so much money for so few vehicles ? '	-6.2307
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted that the railway crossing " deer " was regularly used for long wood transport .	-3.7183
Even wood from the " Kuhbach " area is partly transported through this route because the up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .	-10.4759
Moreover , the route serves as a redirect for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.6187
The train pass " Am " Hirschen " can also be important for a long period of time .	-18.8190
The Councils agreed to investigate the costs of widening the road .	-3.5186
Nevertheless , the majority voted in favour of rebuilding the railway transition with the assumption that the necessary supporting wall was built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " , if necessary for meeting traffic to around 5.5 meters .	-7.1300
The rebuilding of the transition to Gerberei Trautwein could lead to a completely different problem affecting access to the rapidly rising " Geroltzhauser Way " .	-5.2710
The administration had investigated the conversion plans of the railway from the Breinlinger Engineering Agency , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhauser Weg was easily possible .	-5.1681
The investigation came to the conclusion that the road tendencies could lead to longer vehicles sitting in .	-4.6947
Responsibility for this , in turn , bears the city as a street construction carrier .	-3.9818
The reconstruction could therefore entail liability disputes .	-2.9832
Since both the wooden departure and the descent were working in the current state of development , we should not agree to the rebuilding of the railway transition , Haas argued .	-6.5284
At this point too , the risk of a collision of train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than the other railway transitions , because the stop is right next to the centre , where there is a good vision connection .	-7.1575
Even trains from the main station would have to be slowed to the extent that no collision threatens .	-4.1089
The majority of people refused to approve the rebuilding of this railway transition because the city of Schiltach had to " exhaust " the problem of infiltrating vehicles , according to the Councils , since the railways could withdraw from the responsibility after completion of the construction work .	-7.6710
The body considers it unproblematic to convert to the railway transitions " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which cross-country agreements have already been concluded with the .	-6.4575
Esa ’ s Big Space Missions Missions	-2.1007
Far Planets , Gravitational Waves or Black Holes - Experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start in the coming years .	-3.9146
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-7.5888
Far worlds .	-0.9258
More than 1000 planets in other stars have found astronomers .	-7.6014
No one knows whether there are at least some of them .	-2.6387
The selection is difficult : Search for gravity waves ?	-3.4059
Or rather explore the origin of cosmos ?	-2.1105
Or found the planet similar , and thus perhaps discovered alien life ?	-4.9328
These questions are precisely the people responsible for the European Space Agency Esa .	-3.2867
For their " Cosmic Vision " programme , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects to make decisive progress in research .	-3.6692
The budget for such ' L missions ' is around EUR 1 billion each .	-8.5053
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.8461
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-1.7785
30 ideas were up for debate , five of them have now come into the narrower choice .	-3.6537
Numerous bodies evaluated the proposals and follow the researchers .	-3.8394
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-2.5241
A total of four major questions has chosen the esa to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision programme initiated in 2007 will find answers .	-4.1269
What are the conditions for the creation of planets and life ?	-1.7565
The precise processes of the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and hence the emergence of planets circulating these stars - are still in the proverbial darkness .	-5.0129
A large infrared telescope in all could penetrate this darkness .	-2.3364
And when a star has a planet , under what circumstances can life emerge there ?	-3.2725
To investigate this question , 2017 will launch the space telescope " Cheops " , which will examine 500 already known planetary systems in our area .	-5.0798
But the opportunities are limited , cheops are a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.5846
With larger instruments , astronomers could reflect similar planets , even analyzing the composition of their atmospheres , seeking “ biomarkers ” : gases that are considered to be an indication of biological activity .	-4.2494
How does the solar system work ?	-0.7813
This question , too , should ultimately reveal the conditions for the emergence of life .	-4.2575
The magnetic activity of a star and the interaction of its magnetic field , as well as the particle radiation that it emerges with the planet system , plays an important role .	-4.4090
In our solar system , these processes can be examined in a copof . of .	-7.8599
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already approved a M class mission ( there is a budget of around half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-3.5688
The probe will launch 2017 and watch the surface and activity of the sun carefully . to the of , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.5576
Jupiter and his moons are of great interest to the researchers .	-2.0486
They want to find out what role the Giant Planet played in developing the solar system .	-2.5226
The Esa provides for this the first of the three L missions of the Cosmic Vision programme in total .	-2.9209
The probe " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to start their journey in 2022 .	-2.8975
Eight years later , she reached Jupiter and is supposed to examine the atmosphere of the planet as well as the icy moons of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-6.8663
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-0.9370
The universe offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the natural laws we know are still valid there .	-4.7233
Perhaps there are also divergences that could point physicists towards a new theory under which all the known laws of nature can be united .	-8.7918
How did the universe originate and what consists of ?	-2.9214
Our cosmos emerged 13.7 billion years ago through the bang .	-3.2596
In addition to the matter we common , stars , planets and living creatures such as us , there are dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and clusters of galaxies together , and dark energy that accelerates the expansion of space .	-5.4893
So far , researchers do not know what physical laws were valid in the first second fractions of the big bang , nor what dark matter and dark energy consist of .	-4.0017
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved a M mission which is scheduled to start in 2020 .	-4.1444
With a special telescope , the probe is intended to examine the distribution of material in the universe for the first time on the whole sky , allowing conclusions to be found on the nature of dark matter and dark energy .	-5.3118
Who Could Make the Race	-2.5774
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain at the end of the selection procedure .	-1.8999
In the opinion of many experts , the best chances of granting permission as L-Mission is " E-Lisa " , a demanding concept for detecting waves of gravity .	-4.5677
This includes physicists understand changes in the structure of space time that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-3.2675
They have still not been proven .	-1.9686
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-2.4666
The mission provides for a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is stationed in all .	-3.0847
In contrast to plants on Earth , it could also prove waves of gravity that emerged during the bang , providing new insights into the origin of cosmos .	-5.8643
Four more suggestions compete for the second L mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " to explore , among other things , black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , to track and examine the earthquakes planet .	-5.0949
Among other things , proposals on sample return transport from Mars , research into moon , Venus and asteroids as well as sun physics .	-4.8351
Snowden Willing to “ cooperate with Germany in relation to US surveillance ”	-7.9491
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US intelligence service , has declared that he is prepared to travel to Berlin and tell the German Bundestag that the American National Security Agency and its director , Keith Alexander , do not provide answers about their activities .	-4.3611
German Member Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where he received the asylum to discuss the statement in Germany .	-3.3593
In a letter from Snowden , presented to the media in Berlin on Friday by Ströbele , he wrote : “ Although the result of my efforts was proven to be positive , my government continues to treat different views as a faithful break , trying to criminalize political opinion with a criminal threat that is impossible to defend . ”	-5.8340
Saying the truth is not a crime .	-1.6694
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the international community ’ s support can persuade the American Government to fall the charge against him .	-4.4470
The indictment made by the US Department of Justice includes spies and state property theft .	-3.4484
German Home Secretary Hans-Peter Friedrich said online towards time : “ If Mr Snowden is willing to speak to German representatives , we find ways to make this possible . ”	-4.1754
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has heard Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.1523
Thomas Oppermann , the MEP who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that we should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , “ without jeopardising him and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-4.5966
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published a picture of him and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-2.6595
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.3094
Ströble explained that , according to the lawyer of former NSA employee , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-3.0884
If Snowden says in Germany , he needs an assurance that he is ‘ safe ’ , so the honourable Member .	-6.3909
Snowden explains in his letter that he would face a “ serious and ongoing ” persecution campaign that had driven him out of his home .	-3.3414
But he touches on the global response to “ my act of political opinion . ”	-2.4777
Citizens around the world , as well as high-level politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of extensive monitoring as a merit of the general public .	-3.7312
In his letter , Snowden makes an offer to the German authorities to cooperate “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-3.2452
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage	-1.1127
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who want to store hand baggage on their flight .	-3.2213
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even though it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers would be allowed to keep the enti.	-8.9207
The new fee is valid for hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of .	-3.3804
Frontier explained that US $ 25 is charged when the fee is paid in advance , and US $ 100 for travellers who paid only at the flight .	-4.8870
Frontier Speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is designed to persuade travellers to take care of the payment beforehanin adv.	-10.6762
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.0890
Airlines began charging for the first and second piece of checked baggage in 2008 .	-2.4898
Passengers trying to bypass them have therefore stuffed as much as possible into hand baggage , which means that the baggage compartments are often crowded over the seat .	-4.3716
Fees are one way to persuade passengers to take less on board .	-2.8434
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-1.7472
It is about Frontier ’ s most loyal customers , who would have expressed clearly that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find place above the seat .	-4.7387
Passengers purchasing their tickets on the airline 's website do not have to pay .	-2.4347
This means that a passenger at Frontier 's flight may take a piece of baggage free of charge , but the next person may have to pay $ 100 for a similar piece of baggage .	-4.0213
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and check-in procedures would be changed , so passengers are informed about the charge before they arrive at the flight .	-4.1277
Frontier 's new hand baggage fee will not enter into force until the summer , but there is no exact date yet .	-3.3998
Passengers often swamp over baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines are happy to use them .	-3.5555
They argue that baggage transport costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-3.0542
Many on Wall Street see the new luggage fees as a sign that airlines take enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss .	-3.4317
Most , however , still leave the fingers of hand baggage fees .	-3.6460
Spirit Airlines Inc. requested first hand baggage fees three years ago and later , Allegiant Air , also followed a low-cost aircraft .	-4.1541
The only other airline company with such a fee is Hungarian Wizz Air , declared Airline Advisor Jay Sorensen , who is closely following the extra charges .	-4.4659
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand luggage fee Spirit brought $ 50 million per year .	-3.7052
Sorensen , who had previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown to Spirit and was curious to expect him at the plane if passengers faced the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-5.0959
“ The boarding process was among the smooth I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-3.0071
I expected to see teeth knees and hands-on discussions at the plane .	-3.4863
“ The aircraft was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding ran like lubricated . ”	-3.1494
Frontier also follows Spirit on the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.8063
The company explained that passengers purchasing limonade or juice are allowed to keep the entire cans and that coffee is refilled free of charge .	-4.0999
Water remains free .	-0.9281
In 2008 , US Airways sought to demand money for refreshment drinks , but reversed it seven months later , after passengers complained and no other major company retreated .	-4.8061
Frontier ’ s move to charge hand baggage fees if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to direct customers to their own website .	-3.6702
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to $ 25 per ticket sold .	-2.5414
This provides all companies with an incentive to move passengers for direct purchases with them instead of through an online travel agency .	-8.2009
However , Frontier has gone far in this area .	-3.0719
In September the company began to award only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agent .	-3.3728
On Wednesday , the miles were reduced to 25 % of the route .	-2.7496
Air travel with Frontier over 1000 miles booked on a third party provider therefore only brings customers 250 miles in . .	-11.4903
Passengers can also reserve seats exclusively during direct purchases on the Frontier Seats website .	-11.1985
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business is shrinking and the company loses money .	-8.8528
The earnings declined by 9 percent and the aircraft capacity shrinked almost 13 percent in the first quarter , as stated in the financial report published on Wednesday by the Mother Group , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-4.4984
Republic has tried to control the finances of Frontier as part of the sof society .	-3.9604
The Bible ’ s Talk Words	-2.4964
Some 40 women visited the last breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .	-3.0877
The topic of the day in the municipal house was " proverb words from the Bible " and " Middle Ages ' speeches .	-3.3400
Zita Köhler , Chairman of the Church Community Council , entered into a lecture after breakfast on the biblical sayings .	-3.9267
" Talk words contain lifestyles , rules or warnings , " she explained .	-2.6267
It compared several proverb words with the corresponding Bible points and explained the meaning .	-3.1614
She called sayings like : wooden eye is vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone , the His Lord gives in sleep , his hands wash in innocence .	-4.7100
Several times the speaker also advised her listeners what the proverb was .	-3.5384
The Middle Ages expressions were adopted by the Church Community Christel Dehner : all good things are three , blue , somewhat blue .	-4.5968
She explained the importance and origin of the expressions she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.6050
A raffle was lost at the end .	-3.0677
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously rewritten before being passed to the winners .	-3.2767
Among the visitors of the breakfast round , Roman Waizenegger was also a mayor candidate .	-3.3863
Learning instead of unemployment : pilot project for unlearned in tourism	-2.4161
At the Mecklenburgischen Seenplatte , a pilot project for the tourism industry started .	-3.6274
Under the leadership of the Federal Labour Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unlearned in the industry are to be qualified over three winters to professionals for hotels and restaurants .	-4.1005
" New is that the six-month courses end with qualifications , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Agency .	-4.0379
The benefits are multifaceted : the participants would not be unemployed , the companies would receive trained professionals who lacked ever more in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-5.0644
The project also includes the Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gastättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpomern .	-3.0066
NSA explains that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame on the site ’ s crash	-3.2656
The shadowy National Security Agency declared late Friday that a mistake had launched their public website a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-4.0068
“ NSA.gov was not reachable for a few hours tonight because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in an e-mail notification .	-4.4241
The problem will be resolved this evening .	-1.5214
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.3325
During the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not accessible for at least six hours , and that is still not accessible for some users .	-14.2915
Previously , a NSA spokesman had declared to ABC News that the Authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.5044
Some secret information is not in danger , so the speak.	-2.6944
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralysed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.0110
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page views until the servers are overloaded and the website collapses .	-11.8240
Cybertactics are relatively simple and the attacks do not serve to enter the target system 's internal network .	-3.0229
The previously supersecret NSA , whose nickname once was No Such Agency ( no such authority ) , is now found in the bright light of the public , seeing harsh criticism from the disillusioned former NSA employees , Edward Snowden , stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA employees .	-13.3839
The growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-3.1438
The number of people without jobs has fallen easily in October by 22 to 1,307 .	-2.4724
While the 3.1 percent quota is better than last year and better than in September , " we would have hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Managing Director of the Agency for Work in Sonthofen , says .	-7.8666
The fact is that many companies have so far reacted to settings .	-4.3463
One reason for this is , according to Felder-Bauer , " we have few professionals in the craft , in the healthcare system and in the care of the elderly " .	-5.3156
Since September , job offers for staff in the hotel and restaurant industry have been underway .	-4.7584

Prize losses in Bombardier after decline in delivery numbers and orders	-3.7761
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc announced a 15-percent decline in net profit on Thursday , having been under pressure from declining orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter and contractual problems in the railway section .	-4.7441
Bombardier , based in Montreal , did not publish any flight testing data for his brand new CSeries aircraft , and did not provide any new information about whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September .	-4.6469
One and a half months ago , the jungle flight of the test plane only followed three further launches , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is conducted as planned .	-6.0499
The results remained behind the forecasts and led to a fall in excess of eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-3.4961
Cameron Doererersen , analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered its assessment from “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” on Thursday , with a view to limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-4.1213
“ Although weaker aircraft delivery figures were expected to a large extent , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” Doererksen said in a customer letter . the of , and , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.7506
We believe that Bombardier will receive new CSeries orders when the aircraft test program moves forward .	-3.1489
However , if no new orders are made over the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the program .	-9.2011
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries aircraft can catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-2.5720
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delay .	-2.3857
But , so far , binding orders for the CSeries are moderate , as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost-saving potential of the new nozzle jet aircraft are .	-5.0285
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-2.0337
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will achieve his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of the jet .	-2.9704
The company management also assured analysts and media on Thursday , and the program is in the schedule .	-4.2598
“ The test plane no longer remained on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that the aircraft ’ s lifetime had been slow testing and software updates .	-4.9922
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.3834
We have decided to make a first flight and then append a revision period , which we have also done .	-3.1988
This is happening throughout the flight programme .	-2.2902
The second of five test aircraft will probably start in the next few weeks , the remaining ones , as it was said by the company .	-4.7420
Nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical about whether twelve months after the jungle flight the first customer can operate a CSeries aircraft .	-4.4542
Bombardier explained it will review the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the next few months .	-3.1390
“ The slow progress of the flight tests – even if they appear to be in line with Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning shifts to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doererksen .	-4.7061
In the third quarter , at the end of September 30 , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , respectively 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or 9 cents per share per year earlier .	-3.7937
The adjusted profit per share is 9 cents .	-2.9365
Sales slightly slowed , declining from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.8157
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and sales of $ 4.56 billion , says Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-2.5846
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that he has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-7.6883
Net estimates fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.4760
The order book in the aerospace section was $ 32.9 billion on September 30 , unchanged compared to December 31 .	-3.4317
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were within the framework of our requirements , but low order intake and market conditions as a whole were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-3.9026
Sales in the aerospace section fell 13 percent to $ 2 billion .	-1.9154
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this division rose by just under 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.3287
The order book in the transport section was $ 32.6 billion on September 30 , slightly increased compared to December 31 .	-3.0907
The profit margin in the field of transport has been affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.2847
According to corporate governance , new targets will be set for the fourth quarter .	-3.7394
In the afternoon trade on Thursday , the Bombardier share declined by 8.5 % , and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , having also been announced that the Google Finance Board will change Patrick Pichette to the Board of Direc.	-5.2821
Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier ’ s closest rival , announced a ten-percent decline in quarterly profit on Thursday .	-3.5599
Shots at Los Angeles Airport	-1.2828
On Friday morning ( local time ) , an unknown person fired shots at LAX Airport .	-4.4117

Cocaine-dependent lawyer , who warned drug boss against police investigation , must jail	-3.6055
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to Neil Scarborough Sub-Size	-2.6549
The Lawyer was afraid that his secret drug dependence could come to light	-8.1449
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpooler Crown Court	-1.9820
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron against a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be discovered has been sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.7395
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about its drug trafficking activities after he had been compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-3.2538
Criminalists as “ first-class ” lawyer with the nickname “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the police Scarborough monitored that he represented in a previous drug procedure .	-12.0777
Officials watched Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine at the house of lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a meal of the bar chamber .	-3.9942
The investigations revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after traces of cocaine had been found in his hair , wallet , and credit cards at tests .	-4.3567
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorised information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.6510
All four suspects were supervised by the police during a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trading in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.0221
Together with 32 other people , they were arrested later , after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth 1.5 million pounds and 200,000 pounds of cash in a number of house searches .	-4.3242
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared his drug addiction could become public .	-2.4347
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and convicted at Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial in two indictments for obstructing the judiciary .	-4.3894
He admitted cocaine possession at an earlier survey .	-2.7214
The lawyer was convicted after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that they had regularly stood in telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 . the of .	-10.7396
Two investigative officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta 's house and put the drugs under the lawyer 's rubbish tonne with a purity of 60 % in a black golf glove .	-4.3446
Shortly after having delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly called Ditta , who was in the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park during dinner .	-9.2081
The lawyer returned home , picked up the drugs and then exchanged nine communications between the two .	-2.6840
Before the court it was known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocain after tests of class A had been discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-3.9152
Ditta was arrested later , but disputed to take cocaine and said he had spoken to the alleged dealer because he was his client , and claimed that her discussion was subject to “ lawyer secrecy . ”	-4.2408
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and a hair test was taken away .	-2.9321
At the police interrogation , he indicated that he would operate an office and clients at home due to legal matters under both his private address and workplace .	-5.2953
It was announced before the courts that he had called and informed major drug trafficking players , some of whom he had represented before , of significant arrests and of what the investigators knew about them .	-4.4559
Public Prosecutor Anne Whyte said , “ One criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not breaked . ”	-2.6608
Ditta is charged with abusing his position as a criminal defender , as he has joined too much with certain clients .	-4.3477
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug trafficker , but a drug trafficker who provides his lawyer with drugs .	-2.3256
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-2.8263
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.1119
He opposed police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to carry out their criminal activities .	-3.6557
This brought Mr Ditta into disrepute .	-2.6310
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.3410
Ditta pointed out each misconduct and claimed , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I am not , and wanted to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait for 15 hours , but would do so immediately . ”	-4.7286
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from one criminal defender to a criminal at the moment when he began acquiring drugs from organized criminals . ”	-3.6265
His cocaine addiction led to a hopeless compromise , making him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime , who commissioned him to obtain valuable information about police investigations .	-4.1994
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public .	-1.9485
Ditta lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-3.5308
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigation against Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases because of the possession of cocaine and disability of justice , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-7.6060
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that nobody can escape the arm of the law .	-2.8153
We will find you and bring you to court .	-1.7167
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison , having declared guilty of the conspiracy of heroin , cocaine and cannabis .	-2.8358
Thirty-five others involved in drug trafficking were sentenced to a total penalty of 153 years for drug crimes .	-3.6092
Ditta published on his website a field of questions and answers in which he indicated that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , that his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inof opportunity .	-4.9948
Revolutionary Work of Church Music	-1.1989
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary , the song crane Dunningen will frame two services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.5086
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which the spectators enthusiastically performed in the spring of this year , the song 's crane will enrich two services at the end of the year with the performance of the German Fair of Franz Schubert .	-5.8397
On Saturday 26 October , this extraordinary trade fair will be heard from 19 during the evening fair at the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October , from 10.15 a.m. at the service at the St. Johannes Baptistkirche in Lackendorf .	-4.6536
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Sanges to the celebration of the holy victim of the fair " , D 872 , is a spiritual music work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was considered almost revolutionary at the time of the origin .	-4.8976
The exhibition will be listed within the framework of the services , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-3.7974
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the music association Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ .	-2.9072
Haslach ’ s Skepticism Growing Confidence	-2.5055
The 2015 parish council elections , for example , will change fundamental in the Haslach ( SE ) Plain Sea Service Unit .	-5.1938
There is only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-2.4206
In a joint meeting on Saturday the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welshenstein prepared for change .	-2.6014
The fundamental decisions of the Diocese no longer change , and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-4.2141
Over the course of the day became particularly clear : scepticism about the new shifts hesitantly but increasingly confidence .	-4.9885
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsorg Team extended . to the of . , , , , ,	-8.7496
By means of a presentation , Georg Schmitt described the newly developed guidelines for sea care units in the archdiocese of Freiburg .	-5.1635
Afterwards , as a parish of the church , SE Haslach will form a body of public law that will enter into the rights and obligations of the six individual church commun.	-6.1339
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation board representing the parish power .	-3.4031
Each parish should have at least two elected members , in which six parish parishes are formed on site so-called community teams .	-4.3521
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future .	-3.2890
The question of the finances of the individual parish community then demonstrated a great deal of discussion .	-4.6246
The innovations stipulate that accumulated credits are tied in the parishes for purpose .	-4.8893
In contrast , the liabilities pass on to the general community .	-3.1382
There were major concerns , particularly with regard to the major planned investments , the commitment to which all parishes meet .	-4.8752
" Even in the past , investment was made only in projects that could be handled by the individual parishes alone , " relativised Haslach 's parish council chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-4.9490
Practical experience with a common body for five parishes described Barbar Knights , the chairman of the body in the Schutterwald-Neuried Sailing Unit .	-3.9070
They had made their task in 2006 , ' one to become , to stay five ' and had to say that this is not so easy .	-5.7982
The bodies of the Haslach Sailing Unit then answered questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-4.7433
The drafting will be defined in further meetings and will be adopted in another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-4.1184
In the end , the parish council Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of sea care unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-3.9839
In Pfullendorf , the electricity is becoming more expensive	-2.9977
Pullendorf citizens must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-2.7430
As the Managing Director of the City Works , Jörg-Arne Bias , confirmed to the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pullendorfer family will have additional costs 70 to 90 euros per year .	-5.1784
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEC transfer from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.0002
This transfer is re-established every year in October by the four operators of the large electricity roads .	-8.9006
These put the additional costs incurred by the energy transition , which they can impose on the electricity price .	-4.7886
The city works Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-2.4241
The supervisory board of the energy company even assumed in its forecasts a higher levy , as Jörg-Arne Bias reported .	-3.2566
Now the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the urban plants could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-3.9216
" We start from an increase of 1 cent plus x , " says Bias , where the number will be closer to 2 cents .	-4.2093
Time for Permanent Red	-3.5267
Sometimes a traffic light simply does not become green .	-2.1879
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is broken .	-2.1960
What should be done - ride with red ?	-3.8549
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart attorney Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-4.2064
But the waiting time must be ' reasonable ' , which can be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.6901
Becker advises to remain at least five minutes before the traffic light can be determined .	-4.4751
Anyone who continues the journey despite red lights must be aware , however , that he is fully guilty of an accident caused by it .	-4.8865
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision by the Hamm Superland Court .	-3.3706
In the negotiated case , after about three minutes , a driver had ignored the traffic lights and had to blame for a negligent redshift .	-4.1667
The traffic light was not broken , but did not jump to green a little later .	-3.1346
He was spared a driving ban because of the special situation - but he did not punish .	-8.5540
Community council is pleased with sound budgets	-6.5267
Whenever the budget is involved in local councils , Mayor Ralph Gerster is laughing well .	-3.7614
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debts have been unknown to the administration since 2005 .	-3.3438
In this sense , the 2012 financial year can also be a full success .	-3.4252
This became clear when the annual accounts for 2012 were presented .	-2.4065
As Andrea Rothmund said , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was higher than planned .	-2.4749
The surplus of the administrative budget , at around EUR 1.8 million , is around EUR 1 million above the approach .	-3.1580
Thanks to the surplus , in particular , higher tax revenues and the local share of the income tax .	-4.4093
The asset budget was again clear about the planned values .	-3.2148
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million planned , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-1.8079
" This is largely due to the increased influence of the administrative budget , " said Rothmund .	-3.8772
As the 2012 financial year made less investment than was planned , reserve injection has also been higher .	-4.4724
In total , the overall reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-2.4912
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the excellent work .	-5.4427
" Such a work is not simply shaken out of sleeves , " praised Gerster with the annual accounts .	-4.1155
He and the local councils looked forward to the good figures .	-2.9146
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that could cost citizens soon .	-3.6438
Through the good financial position , the municipality has been able to avoid high leverages in the past .	-7.6947
In turn , according to Gerster , subsidies have often been cut back by the country .	-4.6539
There are requirements for these subsidies from various compensatory sticks .	-3.5818
Among other things , cities and communities requesting subsidies must have certain leverages .	-3.5427
'We need to look at the issue of leverage , because in the coming years investments we would like to have grants ' , Gerster announced in this context .	-5.4139
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in Chor for 60 years	-2.2312
At 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the Caecilia Men ’ s Sangle Association is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was solemnly honored .	-4.9889
Hubert Wermter stood as usual in the colors of his male song club on stage .	-3.3722
Even after 60 years , singing with the choir , which has been won , is still a lot of fun .	-5.9615
Verein was also active in the association , including 28 years as a member of the committee .	-2.9414
He received several awards for his commitment and his inspiration : Jörg Kohr , pastoral speaker on behalf of the Caecilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a document of the association and a honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince .	-5.4026
His singer colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German Choral Association and a serious tinteller .	-3.4044
In addition to the honour , the 31st autumn festival was conducted in usual tracks : the MGV Betra , the song crane Salzstetten , the singer department of Baisingen and the local music association , the Vollmaringer had loaded a colourful mix of various choirs and singing styles , which had maintained the around 400 visitors .	-7.3451
The MGV Vollmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In Wine Paradise " and " Lustig , her brothers " .	-3.9954
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared her to honor a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart " Bundeslied " .	-3.7777
The Betra Manner Sang Association also sang classic choral songs such as Julius Wengert 's " Hunter Werken " , " Weit , weg " von Hubert Goisern and the " When you go through the valley " .	-8.2321
With its mixed choir and its women 's group - the " Impulschor " - the song crane Salzstetten caused the female quota of the festival .	-5.3399
The mixed choir kidnapped with the Neapolitan folk " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " by Antos Gus in foreign countries , while the " Impulschor " also referred to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " belonged to their program . the of , , and , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.9718
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to domestic films with " What isch der Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts , where the Fullmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical degree .	-4.9221

Kenya ’ s Press Indignated by Controversial Media Act	-3.2582
‘ We are in a frightening position , and we must ask ourselves : what is Parliament preventing tomorrow from simply abolishing judicial independence ? ’ was to be read in the newspaper , which considers the draft legislation to be unconstitutional .	-5.2390
“ The law is draconian and very punishable and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , CEO of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of the most prestigious independent radio stations and news sites in Kenya .	-3.1134
He said that the new media covenant “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.8776
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.9683
According to the newspaper The Star , the government , through the new law , “ takes the media effectively into a stranglehold , ” writing The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Speech in Kenya , “ suffered a serious blow , ” calling it “ draconian . ”	-5.1625
Adoption of the law is part of a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the follow-up to the attacks by armed Islamists on the Western Gate shopping centre in September .	-7.6384
The Kenyan media attracted the authorities ’ anger because they published photographs of security cameras where the units sent to the town allegedly robbed the luxurious shopping centre .	-5.1608
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to interrogation by appointing two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the submission was withdrawn after an outcry from the media .	-3.5127
Under the new law , media houses can be punished with a punishment of up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to a million and the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-3.9488

Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-1.3275
Bearings like this will no longer be available at Vienna-Schwechat Airport .	-3.5648

Lockers are dogs instead of eggs with a mixture of a tea pool baking powder , a dining spoon dining power and three dining spoons mineral water .	-4.6487
But also 50 grams of soyajoghurt or silk tofu can fulfil this purpose .	-3.4322
According to the Vebu , around 800 000 people currently feed vegan in Germany , i.e. purely vegan .	-2.7940
New York Sleepless	-0.7119
On the way to their hostel families in Weymouth , Massachusetts , the students of the Black Forest Gymnasium met the American large city of New York .	-4.1077
After eight hours of flight , the Brooklyn Bridge was reached on foot by the heart of the city , Manhattan .	-4.3793
Here you have already had a fascinating view of the world famous skyline , which is a special attraction in evening light .	-9.7544
Due to the time shift , the students were almost 24 hours on the legs , but according to the motto " The city does not sleep " the day was decided on at Times Square .	-4.7217
Despite Shutdown , the second day the Statue of Liberty was reached by a ferry and climbed on foot .	-3.9001
Afterwards the financial center went around Wall Street to the memorial site of September 11 .	-4.2622
On the third day , the students of the 373 metre-high viewing platform of the Empire-State Building gained an overview of the fascinating city , enjoying the view .	-4.7283
After that , through the hectic activity of the New York streets , the Rockefeller Center came to the Central Park , which offered an ideal opportunity to stay in the autumn sun .	-5.8932
After a short flight from New York to Boston , students have arrived in their host families and experience school days at Weymouth High School .	-3.4616
This year , too , a Hubertus fair will be celebrated on the name day of the Saint Hubertus in the parish church of St. Marien on the Hülsbergstra<unk>e .	-3.9225
St. Hubertus was a rather ruthless hunter , converted by a vision and later appointed the bishop of Liege .	-3.2779
The hunting group of Westphalia , led by Brigitte Kluth , musizes on perforce grains ( natural horns in the mood Es ) after old , originally French melodies .	-4.7931
The brass wears riding clothes because they mainly accompany riders , horses and dog mouth on town hunting .	-5.3061
The solemn fair takes place on Sunday , November 3 , at 11.30 a.m.	-9.0462
The newly designed Opschlag shines with a new cafe .	-2.8443
One that invites you to stay and come back .	-3.4384
One that wants to make the name a program .	-2.9565
According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the feeling that a new situation has already experienced or seen .	-3.9231
In case of visiting the same name café at the Opschlag in the district town of Kleve in sight of the Rhine-Waal University , it does not have to remain with the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-5.0927
Finally , the café with its beautiful name has the objective : to make a real stay not only thoughtful but handy .	-6.4351
Because it 's just fun and simply beautiful .	-2.7001
A glance into the inner life at Opschlag 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at the beginning .	-4.3073
The state-of-the-art but not cool café atmosphere looks like a place to feel good .	-2.9751
Here , the team spoils guests with the founders Mirjam van der Stelt and Daniel Büttner at the top with various coffee and cocktail variants .	-3.7624
There are also delicious cakes or individually documented fresh baguettes .	-3.6894
The owners , both 33 years old , have already named the " Art Lounge " in Kranenburg before the opening of the jewellery café at the of the ops.	-9.8048
From moving to Kleve to the Opschlag , sympathic café lovers hope for more audiences .	-3.7559
Last but not least , the university .	-3.0847
" We do not have a specific target group , " says Daniel Büttner .	-2.9400
Instead , the two young students here want to address as well as seniors and all age classes in between .	-4.1586
Apropos café lovers .	-2.6919
The sympathetic couple is behind the coffee pleasure .	-3.1852
Enjoy the fragrant hot brew in various variations .	-2.8457
Expressofan	-0.8477
Daniel Büttner is the expresso fan and Mirjam van der Stelt the cappuccino drinker .	-13.0544
" A baguette - that 's my thing , " she tells the NRZ .	-3.7118
Two events were already in the bright café .	-2.7351
Better to say one .	-1.8457
The port festival was rather outside - the Café Déjà Vu did not benefit from it .	-3.5052
But there was also the ring night .	-3.2245
" Beautiful , successful and funny " found the two 33 year-olds .	-2.8931
But it is not everyone 's business .	-2.2063
That is why Daniel Büttner may not be a pronounced fan of event evenings : " You can 't do everything right now .	-11.3396
And with an event I only address those who are interested in the special event .	-3.0554
Events will therefore be the exception here .	-3.2327
" We want to disturb the very normal operation as little as possible " .	-3.1971
Should be said : Déjà Vu stands for reliability .	-2.1838
Regarding the quality of the products offered here , as well as the team and the beautiful surroundings at Opschlag in Kleve .	-3.3930
The road , which is becoming more and more a catering mile .	-7.6724
To the pleasure of many adults , the guests from near and far , and the students who discover the catering mile and hence the Café Déjà Vu for themselves .	-5.5793

The UN ’ s New Goals to Poverty Reduction	-2.7294
The United Nations is beginning immediately to draw up a set of new objectives aimed at replacing the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago to combat poverty .	-3.4269
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro this evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in moving towards “ sustainable development goals , ” which will replace the Millennium Development Goals that expire in 2015 .	-4.1449
They have been included in the final draft document , which will be adopted at the summit by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard .	-6.5426
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-2.5971
“ I am pleased that the member states have agreed to start a process with which universal , sustainable development goals are to be agreed , ” he said .	-3.2677
“ These goals will be based on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the framework for development after 2015 .	-2.6757
I will spare no effort in implementing this mandate granted to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the sustainable development objectives built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-4.0401
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the Handball Ligists still have a good mood .	-4.0922
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt at all .	-1.9245
Everyone remains fully motivated on the matter .	-2.3686
Nevertheless , I hope that we will finally win again .	-3.2693
" Because I no longer know how such a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-3.0131
Although Fredenbeck ’ s third-liga reserve has not yet cast out trees , Malmon is warning in advance .	-5.2795
Many players trained me myself in the A youth .	-3.1581
Therefore , they will be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-2.7114
" It is also important to wait for the SG-Coach to be reinforced .	-4.8355
To finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must certainly increase compared to the previous performances .	-4.0386
Especially in covering and switching games it recently had a huge amount .	-15.2969
The recycling of opportunities must also definitely improve .	-2.5175
Therefore , I hope that my players finally got their head free during the short break .	-3.3788
Mozambique ’ s security concerns are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-2.7371
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder and first president of Mozambique , to agree peace calls to a rare public demonstration .	-3.9853
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , managing director of an investment company .	-9.3318
For fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her business clothing for a T-shirt labelling “ We ask for security ” in Portuguese and joined in the capital ’ s independence square on Thursday .	-4.9033
For two weeks now , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , which are among the worst fighting since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.3768
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by White Rhodesia and later the apartheid government of South Africa in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.3658
According to the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.1480
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will fall back into a grown conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.3923
The stakes for the rapidly growing economy are high , because discovering huge gas deposits off the coast and coal stores in the northwest could bring investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anadarko to the US in the next few years .	-4.5718
The ruling Frelimo Party , the dominant force since 1975 , and Renamo blame each other for tensions .	-2.2405
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province on 17 October , a traditional Renamos stronghold .	-2.7481
The attacks on the previous rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the leader of the group , Renamo ’ s spokesman toward the Financial Times .	-3.3409
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.1384
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-2.0726
Faced with AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considered a “ loser , ” who wants to use “ all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.2073
Both Frelimo and Renamo emphasise that they want to avoid war .	-1.6681
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words that Renamo abandoned the 1992 peace agreement .	-10.1964
He explained to the FT that he meant Frelimo no longer respecting the agreement .	-2.9838
“ Our vision is to resume negotiations and to be serious , ” Mazanga said .	-2.7627
Previous talks between the parties have contributed little to resolving the tensions fuelled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.1912
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who collapse their heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.2349
None of them are well negotiated and none is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.2686
Renamo , pressing for electoral reforms , has already said that it will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.7103
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-1.5034
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to create concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-2.8147
Renamo ’ s election success has shrinked since 1992 , while a newer party , founded by a former Renamo member , Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections .	-3.0252
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.8273
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.5505
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but she has attacked police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection .	-4.0628
Most of the fighting took place in the Sofala province , which is located a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , in which Beira is located , using the port , mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale to export coal .	-4.3136
In June , Rio suspended the use of the railway for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the route .	-2.9539
Mazanga replied cautiously to the question whether Renamo would repeat this threat .	-11.0598
Renamo wanted “ the international community to warn that things are not good in Mozambique , ” Mazanga said .	-1.8550
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , Head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent abduction wave .	-3.4481
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-2.5989
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.5733
“ No one interests Renamo and Frelimo , they simply want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-2.9590
Children should receive myths and legends as “ models for life , ” says an author .	-2.7542
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.6720
But many of the myths are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught at schools , ” which is why Crossley Holland called for a “ careful selection ” of old works .	-3.7308
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-1.8442
I have been proposing this as a plan for 20 years .	-11.8385
He added that , with authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ shut down completely , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ undermined . ”	-4.4787
Crossley-Holland , who has translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and is the author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background as possible . ”	-7.1728
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to give hope .	-2.8482
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.4560
This must be underlying , revealing history and not explaining it .	-2.6617
This is the old story of showing instead of telling .	-2.5516
Hansyakob ’ s Freihof Once . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-9.8124
100 years ago , Heinrich Hansjakob moved to Haslach , and on Sunday his last years became alive in the " Freihof " .	-9.0393

Erich Becherer from Mühlenbach , he drove in style with the two-spanner and " Black Forest " of Erich .	-6.2660
He was not only received by the audience with a lot of applause ; his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-3.3980
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to play in the role of the sister and gave her enormous life in mimik and gesture .	-3.9661
Between the individual game scenes the Mühlenbach farm chapel played appropriately selected pieces of music and completed the performance .	-4.5506
Haslach ’ s mayor Heinz Winkler gave the honor to the award of the honorary citizenship , who , in representation of the then incumbent Hättich , together with a part of the City Council , gave his presence .	-6.9233
Their awareness was subsequently caused by the Three-King singers who caused Hansjakob to declare : " Oh how beautiful , there are youth memories to my own three-kingdom " .	-8.1448
With her song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork days children with their loud " release , release " .	-4.8553
His criticism of the Church of Office at the time had expressed Hansjakob as much as his concerns about the balances in agriculture , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-5.4850
In the home , behind his tomb chapel on the fire near Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-2.8367
" A troubled spirit had finally found his peace and had gone hurried forever , " it said at the end of the scene game .	-4.8064
There was plenty of applause and many praise words from the audience for the performance .	-3.2069
Basketball : Growing the Neckar Giants ’ Hope	-2.0593
Opportunities for the league remaining of the Bundesliga basketballer in Ludwigsburg have increased .	-4.4807
Because if there should be a wildcard procedure , there is now one competitor less for the Neckar giants .	-16.5176
The basketball project Hamburg Towers refrains from applying for a possible replacement .	-10.4330
" We are not going to participate in the Wildcard process , " said ex-national player Pascal Roller , who has since 2012 set up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic City .	-3.7849
Nevertheless , a first breathing was not heard from Ludwigsburg .	-3.0662
" We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure so long as it is not established that Düsseldorf receives no license , " said Neckar-Giant Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-3.8958
Until May 23 , Aussteger Düsseldorf Baskets can still submit documents to the arbitration court and prove his economic federal liga suitability .	-5.1853
But so far the Rhine countries have been refused license twice .	-3.2511
The arbitration court is the last resort .	-1.3191

Triple Piepses Disrupts Residents	-4.8301
Rhenus Midgard has also invested heavily on land .	-1.5274
They distribute the coal coming from ships into the neck .	-3.8300
The company has several irons in the fire at its site .	-2.8171
In addition to coal imports , Rhenus Midgard relies , among other things , on wind plant logistics .	-2.9150
Black coal shimmers in the warehouse in front of the kitchen .	-4.0427
Two massive blue shake and back chargers distribute or load coal here as needed .	-3.7189
Each movement of the handling devices sounds a warning noise over the terrain .	-4.8080
" The signals serve security and are required by law , " says Matthias Schrell , CEO of the Rhenus Midgard in Wilhelmshaven .	-2.6220
Unfortunately , in the case of unfavourable wind , this is widely heard - and there have already been some complaints from people from the north of the city .	-5.2691
He takes the complaints very seriously and has therefore contacted the people concerned , says the 40-year-old .	-3.3734
In close consultation with the authorities , we should now keep the warning signals with technical measures quieter .	-3.5673

In addition to the on-site power station , import coal goes to power stations in the internal country .	-3.7464
If the GDF-Suez power station goes to the network , approximately 5 million tonnes of coal import per year would be realistic .	-3.9004
The three ship loaders on the bridge and the second shipping belt could create up to 10 million .	-3.2071

Oil prices have also fallen further on Friday , having overshadowed a report that China ’ s energy-hungry manufacturing sector is growing .	-3.6251
The reference holes for deliveries in December had fallen in Europe late morning in electronic trading at the New York Mercantile Exchange by 14 cents to USD 96.24 per barrel .	-4.2966

The US Department of Energy declared on Wednesday that the US supply increased by 4.1 million barrels last week .	-2.0926
Over five weeks , the supply has increased by 25 million barrels .	-2.2445
But on Friday there was evidence of greater demand by two reports of increased activity in China ’ s manufacturing .	-2.9131

Blocking the NYPD Stop and Frisk Directive	-2.4878
On Thursday , a Federal Appeal Court in the US blocked a judge ’ s arrangement calling for changes to the New York Police Department ’ s Stop and Frisk Program ( “ Stop and Search ” ) , and released the judge from the case .	-4.3542
The second US Appeal Court declared that judge Shira Scheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until the city ’ s appeal was decided .	-3.7968
The judge had judged in August that the city violates the Constitution with the way in which the programme for the stopping and surveying of individuals was implemented . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.1261
The city appealed against its assessment and the orderly remedies , including the decision to set up a supervisory body to help the police amend their directive and the relevant training programme .	-4.5424
The Appeal Court heard the arguments for suspension on Tuesday .	-1.8394
The Appeal Report stated that the judge should be exempted from the case , because they violated the code of conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of party ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which it had publicly responded to the criticism of the court .	-5.8131
The judge had judged that police officers violate the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they unreasonably targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk program .	-3.6220
It appointed an external body to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and arranged a pilot program with cameras carried out on the body in quarters where most controls were carried out .	-4.3160
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of people who were released after police control .	-2.7905
An oral negotiation to appoint the city is planned after March 14 , 2014 .	-3.5083
Stop-and-Frisk tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights advocates .	-2.9154
Such controls have existed in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded controls rose during the term of office of partisan mayor Michael Bloomberg to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-3.3912
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities submitted complaints that became a collective action .	-3.7815
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop and Frisk Program say that changes will end unfair practices and create a more trustworthy and effective police force , as well as influence the way other police presidents use the rule .	-4.2207
Opponents believe that change would dampen police morality , but not crime ; nor would money be wasted and not solved the broader problem of police forces that are under pressure after the removal of thousands of jobs over the last decade .	-8.2964
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-harisk practice , which is constitutional , but only reform the way NYPD implements controls .	-3.9858

With this wisdom of Beduin , the first chairman Wolfgang Henne described the history and fascination of the association " Helping Hands " .	-2.7473
On Saturday afternoon the tenth birthday of the association was celebrated , which can already have considerable success .	-3.5634
The first chairman , Henne , reported in detail about the work of the association .	-2.9042
He himself was the first time in Mauritania in the Cheijk-Zajed-Hospital in Nouakchott in 2004 .	-2.4036
As a result , further cooperation developed and the gynaecologist Henne performed numerous operations on several occasions .	-4.3492
During the speeches , pictures of the stakes were shown on a large screen so that the guests of the anniversary event were able to make a picture of the actions mentioned .	-4.8553
The desert vehicle of the association has also been shown .	-2.1603
It is a former German border vehicle .	-2.3424
Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had suggested that this vehicle should be equipped with a photovoltaic system and now plans , according to Henne , to work with the association in an advisory function .	-10.5879
In 2008 , the room Schleeh from Baiersbronn created a poverty district on the outskirts of the capital - volunteering during the record period of just under a week .	-5.0809
Henne also mentioned a New Mother Kind Hospital in Nouakchott	-1.6211
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic is to be removed in Nagold .	-3.6376
Much is learned in Africa as a medical professional , such as Henne , for example , acceleration against burn-out .	-3.7752
Due to the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to make as many journeys as planned , but many medical professionals came to Germany to hospitalize in various areas .	-5.7560
In addition , regular containers are sent to Africa with material , as in March of this year medical equipment , medications , association material , hospital beds and glasses .	-4.0151
Mitinitiator Hans-Joachim Fuchtel himself delivered plenty of local colours by telling Mauritania of Mercedes vehicles converted to the mobile goat stable and describing the experiences of hermitage musicians who traditionally support the association during their journey to Mauritania .	-5.2861

Coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip	-1.9343
The former News of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly used “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to try to confirm a false tip on the affair of then Interior Minister Charles Clarke .	-3.8675
Attorney Andrew Edis QC declared to the court in Old Bailey , News of the World heard a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke had a ratio with his “ attractive special advisor ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.9631
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby ’ s voicemails , and tracked them , but Coulson also called them and left news as the court learned .	-3.9965
“ According to the Public Prosecutor , Coulson , who is now editor of the NotW , nobody who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to meet them in fresh deed , but one who likes to face a story to see their reaction , ” Edis explained .	-5.5093
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories : telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation .	-9.7731
The editor is personally involved in the third method .	-1.4773
Obviously he knows of the second , of surveillance , otherwise it cannot be .	-3.8198
What about the first ?	-0.9266
Do he know about the telephone hacking ?	-6.7836
He disputes that , but we say , ‘ And whether he knew about it ’ .	-2.5346
Rumours about a Clarkes affair were first taken up by NotW ’ s feature editorial when a source sexually interested in Pawlby said : “ Don ’ t waste your time , it ’ s together with Charles . ”	-3.7164
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was secured in Mulcaire 's apartment in August 2006 .	-2.8019
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer , on which Pawlby and her sister were stored as “ projects ” .	-2.6940
At the time when the research was run , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking for information about them , Edis declared .	-3.5582
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the movements of Pawlby .	-2.5796
On June 18 , 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to bring out tomorrow , which I would like to talk about with Charles . ”	-3.5653
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important figures , such as former Interior Minister David Blunkett .	-3.2786
On Thursday , the swords heard that Coulson Blunkett faced an affair with a married woman when he was lied with the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married .	-4.3305
Coulson and Brooks dispute having conspired with others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .	-3.5935
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted the telephone hacking .	-2.2649
France ’ s football will indeed pass through the first strike since 1972 from protest against the planned rich tax .	-3.7069
A meeting of conciliation ends without result .	-2.8243
In the conflict over the rich tax , the government and professional football in France took a stalemate after a failed conciliation meeting .	-3.3845
On Thursday , President François Hollande received a member of the Paris <unk>lysée Palace of Associations and Associations and souncomplaints .	-5.1823
But he refused to spare football from the planned 75 % levy on incomes of more than EUR 1 million per year , which all firms in the country will pay for two years from 2014 .	-3.6806
The opposite also remained hard .	-2.4236

Giving No Absolute Protection	-2.4770
" We want to involve the inhabitants in the planning at an early stage , " Mayor Jens Häu<unk>ler opened the citizens information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.6217
Around 80 participants came to the Municipal Hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and bring forward ideas .	-4.0387
Häusler made it clear : " The ultimate decisions are taken by the members of the council " .	-4.0035
The floods , which Geching met unprepared on 15 May 2009 , were a radical event that raised the question of protection for the future , says Häusler .	-4.4147
A river area examination was commissioned with the neighbouring community Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.7310
" The protection of as many built lands as possible is the objective , " says Häusler .	-3.5437
According to the German weather service , the planning of the protection is based on statistical floods to be expected every 100 years .	-4.4630
Climate change is taken into account by a 15 % surcharge .	-1.9355
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-2.5457
The water masses that caused significant damage in Gechingen in 2009 were equivalent to 100 years of flooding .	-3.4075
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " says Häusler .	-2.4486
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima , around EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality expecting national aid of around 70 % .	-4.7280
Householders pointed out , however , that promotion only exists if an overall approach is implemented .	-4.0604
To this end , the community needs the involvement of the citizens .	-3.7783
A complex planning and authorisation procedure must be completed .	-1.9786
In the best case , implementation could begin in 2016 .	-2.4710
Among other things , the concept of protection , which was already presented at the Municipal Council last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the influx of the river Irm from the Stammeheim Valley .	-3.9296
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to introduce their concerns .	-2.9438
Among other things , it called into question why there are no more insulation and restraint basins for the protection of the place .	-4.4665
Gregor Kühn , the specialist planner of the commissioned engineering office Forest and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , stressed that the interplay of all presented measures required to achieve the desired goal in the sum .	-5.3346
Furthermore , the most economic solution is to find Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-3.6701
There was displeasure among lovers of the old town who , even in normal thunderstorms , suffer from congestion of the channel network .	-5.8618
The problem is well known with administration and initial measures have already been taken .	-2.9115
Householders pointed out , however , that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed .	-4.0185
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that two to three years of rain could be cope .	-4.4899

Serious Injured After Columbing	-2.5894
On early Friday afternoon on the road 44 near Revensdorf two drivers were seriously injured in a frontal collision .	-3.1455
The police immediately blocked the road , but initially said little about the accident .	-2.9232
However , there are various testimonials that should only be evaluated .	-2.9721
It is certain that the 19-year-old guide from a VW golf towards Revensdorf , and the 38-year-old gettorf man met her with his hyundai .	-5.3257
Both vehicles clashed together , with the woman so hard clashed down that the fire brigade needed half an hour to get them out of the vehicle wreck .	-5.2461
The real cause of the accident remained unresolved .	-2.1850
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals .	-1.7539
The route remained closed about two hours .	-2.8998

Dick had experiences of God , his late books read as a mixture of the John Revelation and a computer manual .	-2.6664
Perhaps he was crazy , drugs had put his brain in .	-2.3134
He has captured early that the computers are divinities .	-3.2295

At the instruction of the Federal Office for Constitutional Protection and Terrorism ( BVT ) , the German Internal Security Service , he should photograph the roof of the US External Post , which is less than 5 km from the European Central Bank and the Bundesbank .	-3.6510
According to the German media , the BVT wanted to prove the existence of surveillance antennas , and the action led to a change of words between the US and the German Department of State in Berlin .	-3.7733
James Clapper , US Director of National Intelligence , again insisted in September that the US did not use foreign spionage opportunities “ to steal the operating secrets of foreign companies on behalf of US firms , so that they could expand their international competitiveness or profit . ”	-4.5975
But , since Edward Snowden , the former employee who became a whistleblower , began publishing his horn of American surveillance secrets , European governments and corporate leaders are no longer sure whether they can take the director at the word .	-5.2192
Reports that the American National Security Agency has spied the Brazilian oil company Petrobas and obtained data from American cloud providers , including Google and Yahoo , have brought corporate paranoia to a new high level for state surveillance .	-4.1910
The barrel overflowed the revelation that Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s phone was targeted , perhaps for ten years .	-16.0551

“ Germany needs to wake up , ” says Oliver Grün , President of the BITM , representing small and medium-sized IT companies in Germany .	-2.7637
German companies believe that the US is now almost as risky as China when it comes to industrial espionage and data theft , such a survey published in July by the EY consultant .	-4.1262
But there has been no evidence in the documents leaked by Snowden that the US has passed on the operating secrets of foreign companies to its own companies .	-3.9601
Politicians have expressed their concern that the EU should lack certain IT and Internet opportunities and reduce its dependence on the US .	-2.2138

Nevertheless , the reach and technical refinement of US spy companies revealed by Snowden revelations have shocked companies that had previously seen the greatest espionage risk in China .	-3.9957
Cloud Computing is a major change , because European managers are now more aware that US-stored data are subject to jurisdiction and are potentially at risk .	-4.3766
According to a survey carried out by the Cloud Security Alliance , a trade institution , according to revelations of US data mining activities , Prism accounted for about 10 % of US members ’ plans to use an American provider .	-4.6024

" They are convinced that their son was murdered " , Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , towards FoxNews.com.	-2.5965
They never thought he had died as the Sheriff concluded .	-2.2150
“ They believe that there is no logic whatsoever in violating the laws of physics and common sense , ” says Crump .	-3.6431
Rather , they are convinced that the truth is covered up to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-2.8021

US Public Prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into Johnson ’ s death , as a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-3.3586
What was the cause of death ?	-0.7212
Is his death a crime ?	-1.6954
The declared Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.9060
I follow the facts in which direction they are taking .	-2.4077
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.3006
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.1293
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsy suggested that Johnson died of the consequences of “ position-related dripping . ”	-3.5528

CDC Publishing Allergy Policy for Schools	-2.0749
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for handling food allergies from children at schools .	-2.5650
These are the first such directives that the US Government has issued , as the number of school-compulsory children with food allergies rises .	-3.4850
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.7585
According to the CDC between 1997 and 2007 , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % .	-2.2976
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies in the teaching body and employees and how to handle children showaller.	-8.4108
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin stock – the EpiPen brand ’ s auto-injection is most commonly used – in order to meet a potentially deadly oversensitivity reaction .	-4.3463

Parents of intersexual children can vote “ gender indeterminate ”	-2.0451
Germany is the first European nation in which a third sex is recognised for children born with unclear genitals .	-2.4604
Newborns are no longer assigned rigid male or female .	-2.0770
Under the new law , parents no longer need to declare gender for such children , but can “ indeterminate ” or “ not specified ” on birth certificate .	-4.1110
The aim of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for sexual assignment in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-9.2762
According to BBC , one intersexual person later said , “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”	-2.5741
I remain the patchwork created by doctors maimed and full of scars .	-2.1842
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children each year will neither be a boy nor a girl .	-3.3901
They belong to the intersexuals , a group falling under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a concept of collection for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( eggs or hodes ) or unusually developed genitals .	-4.6802
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.3352
Understanding gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise to use the best available gender assignment information if a provision is not possible , and do not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before choosing – if anything – an operation .	-5.7981
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specialized in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-2.9953
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-5.1725
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgery , but most children do not , ” he said .	-2.9564
Gender allocation can be made without operation and then wait for identity to develop .	-3.5853
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity is not very precise .	-2.7899
Nobody knows why it is happening .	-1.5605
It is like the secret why people are gay .	-1.3877
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people should be distinguished from transsexual or transgender individuals , because their status is not gender-based , but because of their biological constitution , which is neither exclusively male nor female , but typically defines both at the same time or not clearly as one of them .	-5.3169
These characteristics were shown in substantial sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breast and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproductive organs and genitals , or chromosom structures and hormones .	-4.2344
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination facing intersexual and transgender people in working life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-3.3807
Not consistent with the gender image now have a special camp . . .	-8.3344
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to specify male , female , or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.1541
In June , Australian Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person after a court had agreed to maintain a “ non-defined ” gender status .	-4.0690
In addition to M and W , German ID has a third assignment , X for intersexual , so the Ministry of the Interior .	-3.5075
In neighbouring France , gender issues are still controversial , such as a news report to France 24 .	-3.4148
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from schoolbooks .	-2.3318
The US website Catholic Online also opposed German law , justifying : “ If the world is dragged into a new state where sex is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we distort two other pillars of civilization . ”	-5.2283
The mother of a newborn from Maryland explained to Baby Zone that it would be better if babies were assigned a gender at birth .	-3.5790
“ Parental life is already stressful enough without further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your child , ” she said to the parent website .	-4.2988
Children need stability and security .	-0.9483
Historically , children born with both male and female sexual parts were called hermaphrodites according to the attractive Greek God , who had both sexes .	-3.2402
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be eliminated and then rebuilt .	-3.0731
But , in the meantime , the ethical foundations of an operation are being questioned , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels in growing with the sex they assign .	-5.3881
“ In the middle of the 20th century one was called a psychiatric emergency , ” said Drescher .	-2.6617
When such a child was born , it was not called the psychiatrist , but the surgeon .	-2.6202
The prevailing theory about the treatment of children with unclear genitals dates back to Dr. John Money from John Hopkins University , who took the view that gender is formable .	-4.0103
He characterized the term “ gender identity , ” and argued that social and environmental impetus – such as parents educate a child – interacted with the genes and hormones of a child , shaping whether a person considers themselves male or female .	-4.7336
But in a case of 1966 , known as John / Joan , his theories became controversial .	-2.7695
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated at a bored circumcision , to castrate the child and also to remove his hods and then move it as a girl .	-6.3764
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of what he was not , ” says Drescher .	-2.4385
When the boy was about 15 , he switched back to male sex and married a woman .	-7.7392
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-2.2372
According to the Drescher , there are still doctors who would practise this model .	-2.1302
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the Internet , survivors of these gender operations have entered the public , which are “ not happy with the result . ”	-4.1054
For example , with Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old Montana author born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-2.9981
The doctors were not clear whether he had a great clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-3.6376
So his external organ and the hodes were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 and was generated as a girl .	-3.6938
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.8488
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he explained to ABCNews.com	-1.8261
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.3952
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic . , , , , , , , , and , , , , , ,	-6.7706
But since he was depressive and knew that something was not true , he demanded his medical files .	-2.9488
What he found out was shocking .	-0.5943
I was sterilized at my birth – and nobody ever told me that .	-2.3353
Bruce was born with a DSD whereby his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop genitals .	-2.4769
After learning the truth , he switched back to male identity , received testosterone injections and removed his breasts .	-3.9226
The operation has made it infertile .	-2.1618
Today , he fights for others in an organization called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-2.6645
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , CEO of the Advocates for Informed Choice Law Group in California , worries that German law could “ encourage stand and stigmatize . ”	-3.5797
“ Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and not to “ assign ” the child , she explained .	-4.0090
We fear this favours intervention .	-2.2082
We think it would be better to allocate male or female gender and then wait .	-2.1143
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.1257
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports the Australian law , because “ it allows adults to recognize as the third sex . ”	-3.2576
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal gender , ” she explained .	-2.0778
German law is about assigning birth .	-2.7366
This is not a battle to force small children at this time .	-3.0861
When they are adults , they can decide their own bodies .	-3.1154
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a breast adiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual disorder and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ authorized ” both parents and children .	-3.6434
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete resistance to drugs .	-2.2653
Due to the recipe refect of the target cells for testosterone developed Katie female characteristics .	-3.2157
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-2.1385
Today Katie is 29 and married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff in children 's psychiatry .	-3.3043
Although it is infertile , it hopes to have a child by adoption or surrogate mother .	-2.8804
“ The law gives parents space whereby they do not have to make overwhelmingly decisions , ” Baratz said .	-4.1195
It gives them the time to make different tests and clarify things , giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female . ”	-3.8482
That way everything is fine – you pull the child large and loves it .	-3.9602
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy the parent happiness .	-2.4892
And we do not have to rush through an operation that can no longer be reversed .	-4.4135
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are driving because they believe they would not do the right thing , ” she explained .	-3.0532
Ultimately , the child decides about the gender that better fits him – and that is wonderful .	-3.2510
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-1.8080
Unknown Injured Girls by Car Shot	-1.8599
Unknown have injured a twelve year-old in Saxony-Anhalt for shots from a car .	-4.0472
The perpetrators probably fired on a group of children in Genthin on Thursday evening .	-2.2683
The police informed this in Burg .	-2.3293
The girl was easily injured on the left wall .	-1.9680
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital .	-2.1680
The shot came from a small car passed by a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-2.3390
Two witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.9434
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .	-1.3662
A disk broke .	-1.4533
They subsequently drove . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-13.2935
The crime police were determined , as was said on Friday .	-3.1516
Until now , Kempten ’ s police inspection can look back on a quiet Halloween night . of , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.4005
Officials were called only twice children who threw them against household façades .	-3.5774
Since homeowners recognized this in time and removed the eggs equally , no material damage was caused .	-4.7378
Furthermore , several sylvester oils have also been ignited in the urban area , but no proper damage has been done .	-10.4563
A resident in the Bischof-Freunderfer path announced that his car was wrapped up with cloppy and his cycling blends were taken away .	-5.4487
Until the arrival of the police , however , the man found his bicycle blinds in the immediate vicinity of everyone , so the police did not need to go further .	-5.7882
Staying with a Future Opportunity	-3.0754
Actually Waltraud Ries lives fantastically .	-2.3934
Your house is situated in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , ancient trees , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-3.5510
It is only a few minutes by public transport to the city .	-11.3077
" You hopefully have no fear of spiders ? " asks Waltraud Ries and shows a fat spider at the door frame .	-3.6614
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-2.2928
But you know how difficult this is in Stuttgart .	-1.7969
The reason , however , is not spinning phobias , but the concern not to be able to cope with the many stairs at home and in the apartment at age , explains them .	-6.1200
Furthermore , since a meniscus operation , the midfifty woman has to know what it means to move from floor to floor with handicap .	-4.6774
Recently a book of her has been published on the subject of ' happy living in age - What kind of residence is the best for me ? ' .	-5.1674
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not get at all at age ' , begins to tell them .	-4.0483
When she moved to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was just a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-3.5448
Today , with mid-fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about this .	-2.6398
She also knows , however , that she is one of the few people who deal with the issue of ' living in age ' .	-4.9109
Most are suppressing as long as it goes .	-3.2194
Old are always only the others , ' she says smiling .	-3.1150
Only when the pressure of suffering is truly large can we think .	-7.7627
'Then it may be too late ' , says Ries .	-2.9192
In her book , the interior designer introduces 17 models for a self-determined living in age .	-3.7459
'Which type of home you choose is always an individual decision ' , she explains .	-2.7938
D i e solution does not exist for age .	-2.0284
Even if you can afford the rest of age in Tuscany or Brittany , you should always think that it can become ill .	-4.1967
And : ' Without good knowledge of the national language , you will join together in the Dolce Vita , ' the author of the specialist book will consider settlement willingnesses .	-6.7731
Their models include classic care models , alternative housing forms or the often quoted retired WG .	-4.1541
At Age everyone has such ticks and Makes	-8.9107
'For me , though , such a community of residence would not mean anything ' , she means with an eye angle .	-5.2153
Even not like a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-3.5078
'At old age , you just need your retreat rooms ' , says Ries .	-3.7140
Nevertheless , the author does not want to exclude the possibility of a senior residential community .	-4.0035
That would have to be different from that of the classic student EC .	-5.0153
And sometimes you just want your peace and quiet , ' she believes .	-3.5191
In this opinion , it is not alone , at least in the national capital .	-3.7116
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment for as long as it goes , " is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of the citizens ' service life at the age of the city .	-4.5694
Your department advises people around the subject of ' Older to become ' .	-4.4266
Therefore , the elderly would often accept inconveniences and restrictions only to stay in their usual environment , which is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-4.9977
There are many possibilities today to make the house or the apartment accessible .	-4.0321
Ries recommends that everyone who deals with the age-oriented rebuilding of their home or apartment should be thoroughly informed and not commissioned the first craftsman .	-6.2980
Today there are also specialists for age-just refurbishment .	-9.1674
Even in the rental apartment there is one or the other , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior designer clears up .	-5.2933
But the existing apartment cannot always be changed age-oriented and thus accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .	-4.9636
Waltraud Ries had to do this experience .	-2.6755
Although you could install a staircase inside the apartment , the path paved with stairs to the door would be far more obstacles .	-5.8094
She will continue to search until she has found the ideal object for her and her husband .	-2.1405
Before moving it greys her more than in front of the spider at her door .	-3.2464
The US Wants to continue to prosecute Snowden	-11.2478
The US has not changed its attitude to former US intelligence worker Edward Snowden .	-2.4081
He will continue to be accused of having disclosed unauthorized secret information .	-2.9583
So he had to face criminal proceedings in the US , the spokesman of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , said in Washington .	-3.5851
The recent statements by Snowden would not change that .	-11.8673
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele called on the US not to punish him further .	-3.1661
Psaki emphasised that Ströbel 's remarks were that of a parliamentarian and not that of a German government member .	-3.7300
Secret service huller Edward Snowden is willing to talk to German authorities in principle .	-3.6108
But first he wants to know what his situation is .	-2.9091
This is what the former NSA employees sought by the USA have clarified in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , Bundestag , and General Prosecutor .	-4.8215
The letter has the following wording :	-2.8222
Jurisdictions	-2.6336
I have been asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass surveillance .	-2.0945
I am a member of Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the United States Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) .	-3.8250
In the course of my employment in these institutions , I witnessed systematic breaches of my government , which led me to take moral action .	-4.2715
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I was exposed to a serious and lasting heat that forced me to leave my family and home .	-3.6752
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-2.4315
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the United States and elsewhere .	-1.7896
Citizens around the world and also high officials - including the United States - have judged revelations on a system of all-encompassing surveillance that no one is accountable as a public service .	-4.1342
These spy revelations entailed many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence .	-3.8673
The benefits for society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while the risks assumed have clearly been reduced .	-3.9606
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government still treats Dissen as a faithful break , seeking to criminalise and charge political opinion .	-3.7684
However , to say the truth is not a crime .	-2.4733
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will take this detrimental stance .	-2.7625
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to participate in the responsible information on the matters relating to the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports , adequately and leg. , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.8554
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and I thank you for your efforts to uphold international law that protects us all .	-3.4675

Kindergarten has found a Private Buyer	-1.7976
" The building is in good hands , " says Winterlingen 's mayor Michael Maier .	-1.8116
The municipality has sold the former kindergarten in the garden road to a private individual .	-3.0882

The budget had EUR 100 000 .	-1.8257
It is not yet clear how the new owner intends to use the former nursery .	-2.4325
The Mayor is right that Winterlingen handed over responsibility for the building before the winter to someone else and therefore no longer has to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , look after the garden and clear the path .	-4.9381
" This effort is now away , " Maier is pleased .	-2.6079

Report : Obama ’ s Campaign Considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.5588
The closest consultants of President Barack Obama have secretly considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in the 2012 campaign , according to the New York Times .	-9.8434
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work by Mark Halperin and John Heilemann about the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-3.1317
The Times has a copy of the forthcoming book , reporting on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers had “ conducted large group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether it would look better for Obama ’ s diminishing hope of re-election if he let biden fall .	-5.4671
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ national correspondent , the book thoroughly records the history of the efforts of leading staff of the campaign and the White House , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , of what effect it has on the poll values to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton for the Vice-President .	-4.4752
The potential change was a strictly guarded secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.6050
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , the former campaign leader , Obama , Jim Messina , and former White House leader , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew the intended change .	-3.6251
Double Down claims that Daley led the effort to exchange Biden despite her “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before finally opting for such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy would not “ improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-9.1359
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government has actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.0467
“ I expressed a whole series of things to consider , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine .	-2.8700
It must be remembered that the President had terrible poll values then , so we thought : “ For God ’ s sake , what do we do ? ”	-3.6192
While Daley called the research “ due diligence , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that significant effort had been made during the re-election campaign to find out whether such a train would pay for the ballot box .	-4.2941
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups unless you think seriously about something , ” Martin explained at AC360 .	-3.3796
But it is not clear whether Obama knew his team thought about an exchange .	-2.0523
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley whether his boss at the time knew about the potential change .	-2.7567
Although Daley said that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former Chief of Staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew about it .	-3.5564
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political probes have reached a desk .	-3.2965
Cooper asked Martin whether he thinked seriously that Obama did not know anything about whether to let biden fall in the elections .	-3.7200
“ Possibly , ” Martin replied .	-1.5222
What happens on the way with my email ?	-2.0956
E-mail actually means electronic letter .	-1.5625
Has the design of the Internet service email been technically implemented as in conventional mail ?	-5.0809
The concept of early Internet services focused on making communication possible .	-2.9844
Therefore , the basic technical protocols have not taken care to create a stable foundation for a consultative exchange of letters .	-3.9306
Therefore , a conventional e-mail corresponds more to an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-3.0533
If user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " , are the machines of the two connected directly ?	-2.9129
The e-mail program or Anna browser sends the mail to the service provider 's mail server in the first step .	-15.5034
For example , if you have a GMail account , it would be Google .	-1.8808
This mail server sends the content to the provider that uses Benni .	-1.8475
On the route the mail can run over several other servers on the Internet .	-3.1023
Bennie can call the content from his provider .	-2.7756
Will traditional e-mails be read through the network ?	-2.9011
Most mails are read several times by software robots on the road .	-2.8841
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail carries a malicious program as an attachment .	-3.9964
A virus check is also made on the receiver systems .	-2.4307
Furthermore , providers check whether it is a burdensome and unwanted spam mail that is deleted or sorted away into a spam folder .	-5.0558
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.6474
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.9390
When Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google can display relevant links to vacation offers .	-4.2621
Also unknown people are reading the e-mails with ?	-2.8231
The likelihood that unauthorised persons read mail is extremely small .	-3.5054
In theory , however , this is possible .	-2.4242
In companies , administrators often have the opportunity to read electronic mail .	-2.3864
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence agencies also have legal means of intercepting or taking note of e-mails .	-2.8477
In addition , there are possible illegal suspension actions . the and . . the .	-12.1129
Is it possible to protect emails against mid-reading ?	-2.0714
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an e-mail can be encrypted effectively against mid-reading .	-13.1765
With a high technical effort it is also possible to conceal the metadata of e-mail communication , so that it is not even easy to detect who communicated with whom .	-4.7189
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-1.5899
Yahoo and Google , according to an investigation by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , play only a subordinate role among the mainly used privately .	-4.3534
While the shares of Yahoo mail last fallen , GMail from Google could clearly increase .	-3.6229
Mother Kills in the Forest and Cashes Pension	-4.0202
When his betrayed mother died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-1.3523
He buried the deaths in a forest - and continued to collect their pensions and care .	-8.0473
In order to collect further pensions and care money , a 67-year-old Wolfsburger buried his dead mother after the police investigated in the forest .	-3.7820
First he covered the death of the 89-year-old , then he collected the money for more than a half years .	-3.4281
Now , as a spokesman said on Friday , the 67-year-old must be responsible for fraud .	-8.5372
So the man hided the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.3770
The man was already suspected in May : at that time , it became clear that no drugs were needed for the careful mother .	-4.7041
The pensioner told the investigators that his mother was travelling to Spain .	-2.6081
Because the officials were strange , they continued to identify it .	-3.6314
It emerged that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and last he had maintained it .	-3.5927
After all , the 67-year-old recognized the death of his mother .	-2.9824
Obduction , according to the police , did not provide any evidence to a capital crime .	-8.5085
Fancy on ice cream that lights in the dark ?	-3.0755
A British entrepreneur has developed the first dark shining ice with the help of qualls .	-3.6118
Charlie Francis took advantage of the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animals and created a shining delicacy .	-3.5769
His idea came to him when he had read a research on pitfalls and persuaded Chinese scientists to artificially produce the bright protein .	-9.8446
The ice cream responds when eating with the tongue , increasing the pH value in the protein and triggering the luminaire .	-3.4913
Chris explains that the food responds to the warmth in the mouth and shines – the more you lick , the brighter it gets .	-11.1676
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company Lick Me I 'm Delicious , says : “ The product is incredible but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.7832
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-2.0371
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH value rises and the ice shines .	-2.9308
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed ideal to bring it to Halloween because it has this wonderful luminaire effect .	-4.0307
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever manufactured , since the quantum luminaire is four times more expensive than gold .	-4.0336
Each ball costs about 140 pounds .	-1.7533
But it tastes delicious .	-2.7324
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and leaf gold .	-2.7183
But his latest creation should become even more ambitious .	-2.1271
He says : ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ’	-6.8343
This is in itself impossible because of the break of light caused by the ice crystals that consist of ice cream ; but I suspect we find a way to make it .	-8.9256
Ice cream uses the fluorescent characteristics of a trunk artificially manufactured by Chinese scientists	-3.1851
The TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League after six days of play .	-8.4963
Excellently now , the team of Ingo Ehlers will join the Derby against TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-4.4636
With this game the season starts new for us .	-1.8935
" I hope we finally have the head free , " Ehler 's behavior is optimistic .	-2.9438
At last , with the exception of the permanent injured hendrik Blohme , he has his complete cadre available .	-4.5673
Daverden also relies on tempogame .	-2.5227
We must therefore keep our error rate low .	-2.1271
First and foremost , however , we must increase the cover , which has last left anything but a safe impression .	-4.7204
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz is relaxing after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-3.8353
The game was of course a house number .	-1.1502
But that ’ s why we ’ re not favorite , because everything can always happen in Derby .	-4.1841
However , Panitz now wants to launch in Morsum to launch a series .	-8.7915
Jan-Malte Jodat is missing .	-1.6783
The A-Youth Joost Windsuss is celebrating its seasonal debut with a double playing right at the A-Youth Federal Ligist HC Bremen .	-5.1657
Who is not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.4665
Halloween 2013 : In numbers	-1.5906
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.7697
My sister and I was allowed to eat sweets , stay late and dress for the neighbourhood .	-2.6325
Today I have become the Halloween muffle .	-3.1256
Over the last two years I have not agreed to distribute from my apartment from sweets , and I do not think it will do so this year .	-8.8245
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep with regard to Halloween .	-2.3720
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on candles , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Retailers Association ( NRF ) .	-3.0821
One thing that I am looking forward to again every Halloween is the trend value .	-3.8269
The costumes will make up about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , according to the NRF .	-2.1871
This year , impressive unlively items are the last cry .	-3.8665
Women no longer have to cover up in sexy clothing , they can now embody seductive food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .	-3.7178
As far as men are concerned , I expect lots of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet the Daft-Punk space men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-3.2166
According to Google , the most sought-after costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches . . of . , , , , , , , ,	-8.3426
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.1327
Last year we covered our dogs and I was surprised not alone .	-4.1980
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , says the NRF .	-2.1341
These are a lot of “ hot dogs . ”	-2.1313
As far as candles are concerned , we are not quite impressive .	-3.8507
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , said The Nielsen Company .	-1.6332
These are approximately 270 million kilograms of chocolate , slides , candies and rubber bears .	-4.0332
So good news for the US Department of Trade , according to the US Department , is 41 million people drawing through the neighborhood by saying “ sweets or saures . ”	-4.8145
In fact , we will buy over 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not delude ourselves – eat .	-2.5201
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet Candy Corn , yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of Sweets Producers .	-3.6961
That is about nine billion grains of maize .	-2.0003
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to resolve .	-5.4913
Nothing belongs to Halloween more than houses in which it spuns .	-2.7281
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is , incidentally , a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-6.8631
There are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States that achieve $ 500 million in revenue , according to America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photos that are being pinkelt in pinkels and friends on Facebook , where they are not going to get rid of them , and then leave a comment like “ nice facial expression . ”	-7.0956
But we finally come to the cumbers .	-3.4530
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Kürbis when we were children , and the carving of a pumpkin is like decorating the Christmas tree – something we made from small ones .	-4.1268
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend only began last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with cutting the pumpkin and not sitting in it .	-4.2300
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on returns , according to the US Census Bureau .	-8.5178
The pumpkin lateral , which is slowly rotting in the front garden , is probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkins were harvested this year .	-4.4014
If you want to make the right points , call Tintin and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut some pretty glasses from their 921 kilos heavy pumps .	-4.7039
Helmbrecht ’ s Fire : Life Forces Behind Cold Corpse. . . . . . . . , , , , ,	-13.9665
The fire brigade had to express itself in Helmbrechts on the late Thursday evening .	-2.3977
A three-family house in the county courtyard catches Friday fire during the night .	-2.8348
The rescue forces hold a cold corpse from the house .	-3.3390
Rescue forces found a cold body in a three-family house in a fire in Helmbrecht .	-3.8464
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-2.9390
Late Thursday evening it burned on the ground floor of the house .	-2.8112
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames already beat out of a window .	-2.0727
The staff went to the apartment and found the body in a room .	-2.4458
This and another room burned out completely .	-2.5566
The entire ground floor was damaged .	-1.7016
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued to explain .	-2.8028
The building is not inhabitable for the time being .	-9.2439
The exact cause of fire was initially not clear .	-2.0627
Germany ’ s largest state church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor .	-3.0896
The background is a possible parish shortage : the Evangelic Lutheran Church Hannover expects the number of its currently around 1,800 pastors to halve by 2030 , according to current situation .	-5.2427
Today 's young people are very attractive and offer good future prospects , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical press service .	-3.7551
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day-to-day process itself .	-3.4409
With Burfien , for the first time , the Church of Landeskirche has appointed a pastor in a full place to inspire young people to study theology .	-4.7024
At present , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after bitur .	-2.7770
Burfien attributes this to the process of deception : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-3.5147
The profession is of great freedom and diversity .	-2.5581
I am a master of my calendar and can place my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.1300
As a patron , pastors could be very close to people .	-3.7764
They earned as much as teachers and could live well from them .	-2.3913
To be sure , more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-3.2844
That is something for today 's young people , who are not just concerned with careers , but with meaningful work .	-4.7729
According to the Church of Lower Saxony , around 60 pastors are retiring every year .	-3.1547
At the same time , about 40 graduates from theology studies begin their vicariat .	-2.5133
In sparsely populated peripheral areas , such as resin , the Emsland or the Wendland , it will be difficult to fill jobs in future .	-4.1118
Among other things , Burfien wants to organise study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied in theand . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.9916
Theology studies offer broad education .	-2.4043

Land Rover Rally Series	-1.2397
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as an open-air connec. , , , , of , , , , , , and , and , .	-8.8997
The options range from reinforced brakes , a service package with care for bowler works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle storage between events .	-3.8568
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ Rally clients coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.8211
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as for an accessible way to world class events .	-4.1723
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format will open up new possibilities for experiencing the various Rally disciplines in the United Kingdom and abroad and preparing new ones for the straps and reality of Rally Raid .	-5.1547
We really had fun developing the Defender Challenge car – this will be an entertaining championship .	-3.1123
The Defender Challenge also has a training and test day in February and the option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.2246
Fire brigade called to save a little bitch , which cast 15 metres above the ground on a dangerous rock leap in a quarry	-14.3269
Cockerspaniel Hündin Ruby went away after a smaller traffic accident	-3.0905
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her predicament .	-3.0125
Fire fighters roped on the rock wall and saved the dog from safe death	-3.3051
The fire brigade succeeded in safeguarding a little bitch caught in a rock wall at a height of 15 meters .	-5.3763
The nine months old Cockerspaniel Hündin Ruby went away after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .	-4.1647
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry of Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby again and thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.5932
They had desperately sought their missing bitches and published calls for assistance in social networks when they came to the quarry after the small accident .	-4.7746
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who took his dog , saw the stranded Ruby on the 15 meters high sale in the quarry .	-4.9678
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to rescue Rubys , which was then transported to the top of a dog box .	-4.4458
Andy Clayton , a technical rescue team specialist , said : “ She was in a dangerous position .	-2.1180
It was situated in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from above and from the ground .	-7.5094
She did not move muscles during her rescue – she was like step-frozen .	-3.8539
But now you are doing well . .	-13.1723
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-1.9193
That was quite an unusual commitment .	-2.9601
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.2273
Peter Lau , the technical rescue team specialist , said : “ Ruby had a huge happiness . ”	-2.4079
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-1.9966
Ruby was investigated as a veterinarian , but he found nothing but exhaustion and dehydration .	-3.4044
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ Watching the rescue was frightening . ”	-2.4646
I could not believe that she was really there above . .	-9.4528
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-1.4470
The veterinarian explained that if exhaustion had become too large and collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.7090
The fire fighters have done great things .	-1.9325
It was really courageous what they did .	-2.1490
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.1804
Scott Alderson from Keighley added : “ We were afraid she would fall , but she remained above . ”	-2.1950
The fire fighters were great .	-1.6135
I can hardly believe where it was .	-0.9959
Mick Jagger explained that he never took Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-3.0558
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said that she worked as a background singer to Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits Die Hard ” in 2004 .	-3.6139
Perry explained that she did dinner with the dryer and that “ he dried me when I was 18 ” .	-4.8184
She added : ‘ That has long been a long time ago and he was very nice to me ’ .	-3.4805
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , on Thursday said that he was “ categorically denied that he ever tried to converge with Katy Perry . ”	-3.7075
The representative added : “ Perhaps she mistaken him with someone else . ”	-2.2239
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones Tour this year .	-1.9969

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the Choice	-1.7357
A new day , a new history of independence .	-2.0041
This time we are warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.0733
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire border along the Hadrian Wall .	-2.9377
In fact , the Strathclyde template pointed out the possible economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but it did not matter in the headlines , as expected .	-4.7647
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often bend their strict rules if they are more favourable .	-3.5755
Since Scotland is not part of the Schengen area at the moment , continued non-attention for Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what the Scots really want .	-3.5285
So no story .	-2.4689
And one that has come so far in the years that it is already like a fossil : The first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” -duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.6393
An interesting point in constantly repeating this ancient story is lost .	-2.7612
Why expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European pipe ?	-1.8407
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels , especially now ?	-2.2972
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan to unite Europe has stalled .	-2.6433
With the euro crisis , the European project died officially .	-2.0816
Throughout the EU , parties are gaining ground that are anti-EU or want to throw the euro on board as a common currency .	-3.7017
Even in Germany , the Eurosceptic Party , founded only this year , was able to rally nearly five million votes in September ’ s federal election , effectively driving the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-5.2114
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.5021
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.5447
Because of the rigorous austerity imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the forced jacket in which the respective national economy is required by maintaining the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.2497
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – that was only the case in Greece .	-2.2231
Instead , the euro system has fixed its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German politicians want to let that happen .	-3.4918
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe will find itself again with an integrated productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-3.2574
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-1.8317
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems , there is a deeper European productivity problem .	-2.1002
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives prescribed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays double in terms of electricity and gas compared with the United States .	-3.3513
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have seen in Grangemouth .	-2.7293
All wage fixes in the world do not protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner of cheap American shale gas .	-3.0681
As a result , a revolt rises , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-2.5873
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle to keep Germany in check and raise Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-2.6909
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has imposed Europe ’ s own economic policy , with the struggling French economy .	-4.0533
The result : Marine Le Pen 's right-wing , anti-EU Front National has just won a decisive election , thereby pointing the ruling Socialists to three .	-3.9982
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of the vote , a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that a right-wing division would automatically benefit the left .	-3.1225
What does Le Pen do with its newly won popularity among the white French working class ?	-3.1573
It wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.3832
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.7419
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-2.8799
The EU will not disappear , but it will become more like the “ Europe of sovereign nations ” that General de Gaulle favored .	-2.2684
Germany and some of its satellite economies may stick to the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.2396
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering with the US .	-2.7019
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific Area suggests that Britain will be in Atlantic rain alone .	-2.3079
Where does Scotland stay with all this ?	-2.3559
We can decide to be a region of ( lastly ) small England .	-2.8817
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hit .	-2.9946
I suspect Scotland could go quite well in a looser European association , provided we keep our own currency .	-4.0246
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.5448
Otherwise , we should consider equating Norway and maintaining our economic independence .	-2.2002
The SNP administration in Scotland is , remarkably , the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and gained a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and made ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem Coalition had to account for .	-8.2929
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to choose independence now , only to impose austerity on Berlin and Brussels .	-3.0826
Adult Puberty	-1.7139
African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age genocides , as studies show .	-3.1431
Physical change does not immediately mean puberty	-2.0617
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.5249
Experts believe that epidemic obesity is a trigger of early puberty	-1.3764
The Early Puberty Trend is Less prominent among boys	-2.6125
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etheridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-2.0994
Should a mother be worried if her daughter already grows breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight years ?	-11.2644
At the annual conference of the American Academy of Pediatrics Association this week in Orlando , Florida , the pediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz declared that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and were a new norm .	-3.2047
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no indication that puberty is entering quickly , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-3.8477
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hairs and body smell , are shown earlier in girls .	-4.3021
Nevertheless , there has been only a slight shift in menary age ( occurrence of first control bleeding ) over the last 40 years .	-4.1681
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , a little less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-2.2205
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to the menarche , ” said Kaplowitz , author of the book “ Early Puberty in girls : The essential advisor to deal with this often occurring problem . ”	-4.5695
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-1.6076
It is controversial what is actually the beginning of puberty , but it must be ‘ early ’ if the breast increase is accompanied by a boost of growth a year ago .	-5.1326
In most cases , the process is slowing or stagnating – something that a child doctor can monitor closely .	-2.9347
When progressing faster , tests could be shown by an end cronologist to avoid serious problems such as tumors or cystes .	-4.6136
There are treatment methods for delaying an early menstruation and defending another consequence : the premature ageing of the bones , which can ultimately lead to the restriction of growth and therefore small body growth in adults .	-5.1213
The recommendations for a drug or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the growth rate and emotional maturity .	-9.9765
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-0.9381
Kaplowitz is cautious about medicines , but he acknowledges : “ Oppressing puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and the feelings of girls to be different from their peers . ”	-4.4318
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.9639
“ They worry about the risk of pregnancy or how they handle the hygienic side , ” said Kaplowitz .	-3.0457
“ It was a shock , ” remembers a woman whose daughter got her ten days .	-2.6512
Even though there were some signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was emotionally not prepared .	-2.8757
She came fearful and excited from school home because she was the first circle of friends .	-3.1330
There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.7296
But there is no coherent evidence that hormones in milk or other foodstuffs , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media would be caused .	-3.5288
Boys , like girls , come into puberty earlier .	-3.2824
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.2588
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine years , which established a connection between body fat and entry into puberty .	-3.7674
Other investigations support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that played a role .	-2.1698
In that country , African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white age colleagues .	-3.1435
There are different explanations for this .	-1.5473
Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all sorts of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-2.6099
Another puzzle : although boys grow their face and shamefulness earlier , the trend toward a fully-fledged former puberty is not as prominent as girls .	-9.6740
Other doctors at the AAP conference highlighted the complexity of the issue .	-1.9844
The emergence of acne and shamhair is common even in babies and infants .	-3.1599
“ We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr. Lawrence Silverman , a paediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.1291
Parents should not hesitate to be consulted by their children ’ s doctor as they should speak to their children .	-3.3564
“ This can mean that you have to talk earlier than expected , ” Kaplowitz said .	-3.9537
If you stay calm , the child usually responds well .	-2.8835
Girls flourishing early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than thought .	-3.2613
Jumbo manufacturers contend with large orders about the width of seats	-3.2856
There has been a conflict between leading aircraft manufacturers over the width of tourist seats on long-haul flights , which indicates the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.2551
The dispute is about the width of seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always those who make the most effort to carry out airlines , but this designated space is the key to the efficiency assertions of the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co . .	-6.3541
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring a minimum seat of 46 cm ( 18 inch ) in the tourist class , but the US Archrival Boeing says that this should be decided by the airlines .	-4.0156
The discussion comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul aircraft , and are expecting record orders during the event from November 17th to 21.	-4.6844
As the rear part of the aircraft has been designed – especially whether there are nine or ten seats – is crucial to the economic results given that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design is supplied .	-5.0606
Boeing claims that its modernized 777X consists of 406 people in tourist class seats that are more than 17 inches wide , allowing 10 per row .	-5.0694
Airbus declares that the competitive version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine perper.	-3.5030
Aircraft giants often distribute loves about technical details by means of advertising in the specialist press .	-3.8300
Now Airbus is appealing before the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to race with more than 100 orders , directly to the public .	-10.6659
Recently , the company presented an advertisement that could be the beginning of a new advertising war and showed a picture in which three people sit together in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.2924
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats tighter than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus Chief of Sales John Leahy .	-3.1129
With changes in food habits , people are thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.2674
Between the early 1970s , when the Boeing 747 defined modern long-haul journey , and the end of the century , the weight of the male average American increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to data from the US Department of Health .	-3.9985
The waist range of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm according to US health statistics .	-2.9752
Airbus says that its rival kept to a seating concept from the 1950s , when the average body range of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-4.0394
According to Airbus , investigations have been carried out that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleeping quality by 53 percent .	-4.0204
Boeing disputes the figures from Airbus to its seats and says that it is not at the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines make the balance between airlines and facilities .	-4.4741
The company also explains that , according to investigations , the aircraft experience depends on more than the width of the seat .	-3.7087
“ It really amounts to giving flexibility to airlines so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains the expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-11.4857
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.5052
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.3365
Passengers are talking about more elbow freedom , but it is increasingly an issue for manufacturers that can affect sales .	-3.9091
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a sustainable impact on the US or Europe ’ s export balance .	-4.1278
As Reuters first reported in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the discussion about the new jets .	-3.2879
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.1032
Boeing ’ s statements on the results depend partly on the 777X being compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777 series with its ten seats per row .	-3.6236
The increased costs per unit are still lower than currently used machines with ten seats per range .	-3.0706
“ Boeing therefore quets more seats in his plane to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Comfort at European Airbus .	-3.2143
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per series of 777s indicate that many passengers chose the closer arrangement , which could go hand in hand with cheaper fares .	-4.4436
“ Eighteen customs seats would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert in cabin setup , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-8.4877
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but rather a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can select .	-8.1924
The world-travelling jet sellers even carry band-measure to measure the institution in competition .	-4.7893
Even if they arrive at comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compacted design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-3.8736
Airbus offers a ten-seated A350 , but has not sold anything according to its own statement .	-4.0332
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of adapting cabins and offering wide seats at the corridors for some jets .	-3.4286
Without the support of the only other modern manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to buff , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.5350
New Anti-Nicotine Vaccine Could Garaus Enjoy Smoking	-3.5504
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.7574
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetime .	-7.4245
Further trials are needed before human testing , which may take several years to come , but Professor Ronald Crystal of the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results were good .	-4.1694
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying out all the methods available on the market , but have seen that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” says Cornell .	-4.3897
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed to include genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-2.7536
The virus selectively infects the liver cells that then produce a constant flow of antibodies .	-2.4256
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving a smoker with no nicotine high .	-3.0113
In trials , vaccinated mice administered by nicotine retained their normal level of activity .	-2.7152
By contrast , mice without vaccination would have taken a “ time out , ” researchers said , a sign that the nicotine had reached her brain .	-3.8432
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine page .	-2.0473
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.4351
The vaccinations had to be given so often to maintain the antibody level that they were expensive and impractical .	-2.6409
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.6141
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .	-3.5227
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-1.7647
" They know , when they start smoking again , they no longer feel pleased about the nicotine vaccine , which helps them to store the habit , " he explains .	-5.1368
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.5643
Tripodi Defended to have been influenced by Obeid	-7.3094
The former laboratory minister Joe Tripodi from New South Wales is launching an investigation by government corruption supervi.	-4.6426
The former NSW minister disputes having changed maritime control rules at his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had hidden participations in three lands on state-controlled land .	-4.5908
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) expanded its investigation into the question of whether Obeid influenced various State Ministers in terms of extending leasing contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café , without tendering after their expiry in August 2005 .	-6.1361
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi knew Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the properties after Tripodis ’ former deputy chief of staff , Lynne Ashpole , had stated it on Thursday .	-5.4670
In many years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the length contracts .	-4.0943
The staff were friendly and helpful .	-4.3123
In 2009 , the leasing contracts for companies at the Circular Quay , which introduced the Obeids $ 2.5 million annually , were extended without public tender .	-4.7381
Tripodi , who was Port Minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , originally called for public tenders .	-2.8808
But he disputes having made the changes to Obeid ’ s requests , which , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a transformation of the government ’ s leasing regulations .	-4.9450
A telephone address presented by ICAC showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who had changed to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the Fisheries Authority .	-4.3741
“ Was the issue discussed in these telephone calls the drawing up of commercial payment rules ? ” asked the deputy Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi .	-4.2214
“ No , ” Tripodi replied .	-1.5196
I cannot remember what was discussed , but it was definitely not .	-2.1766
Definitively not between me and Mr Obeid .	-1.7789
Israeli combat aircraft attack targets in Syria , so official sources	-7.5216
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked a goal in the Syrian port of Latakia on Thursday night , confirming a senior government staff vis-à-vis Fox News .	-3.1271
The official did not explain what the objective was , however , said that it was at least one .	-2.7321
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.7647
At least twice this year , Israel has already carried out airstrikes on missile deliveries in Syria .	-1.8876
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be “ authenticity test ”	-2.8058
The government is considering an “ authenticity test ” for foreign workers with 457 visas as part of extended measures .	-3.2535
If the test were to be introduced , it would be used by means of a criterion to prevent the 457 from being used to fill unqualified jobs or as a back door to train family and friends to Australia .	-4.3678
Today , a proposal for discussion has been published by the government , having condemned the former Labor Party MEPs , Maxine McKew , the government 's comments with regard to foreign workers , because they could be considered insult by Australia 's neighbours .	-5.5428
“ Strong declarations like foreigners are to backfire – and Australians first stop – are a very unpleasant recurrence in times when trade unions demanded a protected labour market , ” she said to Australia India Institute today .	-5.1384
Historically , this meant that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region hear an echo of this historic artifact , I would not be surprised .	-3.5823
The discussion proposal outlines twelve measures once considered by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-2.4724
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was in Sri Lanka yesterday ’ s discussion on trafficking in human beings , implemented five of the recommended changes , and the others are still being considered .	-3.9253
If the ‘ authenticity criterion ’ is adopted , someone applying for a visa could be checked to see whether ‘ the application is real in cases where the applicant is related or personally associated with the holder or a relevant person of the supporting company ’ .	-4.8346
Furthermore , firms could be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders , having finally hired hundreds of companies that first wanted to support a small number of workers .	-8.6077
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum probably died from a heart attack after he arrived this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas Island .	-3.1041
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came to Australia has been cared for since the death of his father on Wednesday by an adult cousin who was also on the boat .	-3.7399
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital , where he died .	-1.6326
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.1296
In the work of HS2 Ltd , high-speed connections between Scotland and the north of England are proposed , even at the start of phase 1 in 2026 .	-11.4864
Secretary of Transport Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring Britain closer together . ”	-2.0055
The Scottish Transport Minister , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-7.5610
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway link between London and the West Midlands .	-1.8472
After Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.2474
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and North England from GBP 32.7 billion to GBP 42.6 billion .	-2.2545
The UK Government , which is in talks with Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland .	-6.4182
This includes the possibility of a travel time of three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-2.5425
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.5599
We are moving forward with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.4421
Without it we face a crisis of capacity on our railway network .	-2.8374
But there is also the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.6998
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-1.5882
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for a “ clear ” approach to Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-2.8818
Brown said , “ The high-speed rail link has enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for rapid rail connections across the UK . ”	-4.1120
That is why we are pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for high-speed rail links in Scotland , which creates benefits for all and complements the Glasgow Edinburgh connection , which the Scottish Government is already planning .	-4.3850
I look forward to examining the report of inquiry with the British ministers next year and to adopting the next steps together .	-3.0675
Regulations on aircraft electronically in force in Australia	-2.4688
Australian airline passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones on start and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease regulations for such devices .	-3.8768
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read e-books , watch or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.2982
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-4.4121
Australian companies observe the decision to implement which US airlines have to do a huge amount of work , but do not pursue immediate plans to change their regulations .	-4.4735
The CASA Aviation Safety Authority also stated that it would be looked at the announcement , but emphasised that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment still apply in critical air phases in Australia .	-4.6729
“ CASA has currently no specific regulations regarding the use of electronic devices on the aircraft ” , has been announced .	-3.7608
The subject is subject to provisions that airlines must always maintain safety and passengers comply with the safety instructions given by cabin staff .	-16.4014
Virgin has already held discussions with the CASA on the exploitation of its Wi-Fi entertainment system on flights and has said that it is open to change , but it should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.0235
“ We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic equipment by the CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer experience after we offer wireless entertainment during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.2366
Qantas explained that it would remain in the current regulations until further notice .	-4.6100
“ Our current directives provide that electronic equipment must not be used when starting and landing , and we do not currently have any plans to change it , ” said the company .	-4.0747
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.3561
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.4096
The decision affects US companies differently depending on the age of the fleet .	-3.0108
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate the radio disorders by mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs and customer instructions .	-4.1886
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable , lightweight electronic equipment such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at any level , ” the FAA announced .	-3.3949
In rare cases , in bad vision , the crew will tell passengers to switch off the devices while landing .	-4.2860
The group also recommended storing heavier devices on start and landing safely under the seat or in the subjects over the seats .	-4.1551
Before the Revierderby against Schalke , BVB trailers with luminosity caused ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-4.9821
Borussia Dortmund then announced tough consequences .	-1.4936
Before the Friday game of the Bundesliga football league against the VfB Stuttgart , the ultras reacted with a silen- . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.5399
It was an unusual , almost spectacular acoustic that offered the viewer in the signal Iduna Park until just before the attack of the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart .	-4.3114
The guests were mostly listened to with their vocals .	-4.7698
The southern gallery , on the other hand , where the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand , initially presented themselves extraordinarily quiet : no singing , no battle calls .	-5.7204
The capo ’ s podium , which otherwise coordinates the common fire , remained unoccupied .	-3.0113
And the front flag in the gallery lonely blowed with a label " Stadium Ban " .	-5.4252
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player , broke up short-term cheers .	-4.6242
When his team colleagues followed , there was loud singing and blowing scarves - but far from everywhere .	-3.6661
There was nothing in the central blocs 12 and 13 of the southern gallery .	-2.9058
Also that stadium spokesperson Norbert Dickel listed the positive experiences of recent days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , contract renewal by Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause celebration .	-4.4498
Only five minutes before the plague , the Capo climbed his podium - and the tension that was tangible until then escaped in a loud cry , when thickets as usual requested the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-6.9110
Finally , as always the South Gallery was the turn - and here , as usual , was the loudest place in the stadium .	-4.7769
And , at the latest , when the southern gallery received a loud call for " Derbyzeiger stands up " , everything was as always .	-6.0088
Silence before was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-2.4887
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the following BVB followers had fired lamps in the spectators and on the square - almost goal-hut novel Weidenfeller .	-6.1478
The game was played late because of the chaotic scenes .	-2.2060
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke then received the tips of Dortmunder Ultras in his office - and you think Watzke 's words , this was a rather uncomfortable date for fan representatives .	-3.8233
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-2.8142
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited Ultras from choreographing the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-3.6917
'I prohibited this ' , he declared .	-2.5031
We cannot give up the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-2.0185
In addition , the Ultras have shown various ways of punishing - until Tuesday they now have time to choose one .	-5.1270
Otherwise , Watzke says , the BVB will determine a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.6914
" This becomes dramatic " , insured watzke .	-3.1879
It is interesting to know how the reactions in the Southern Gallery are then .	-4.5563
Pfandhouses Boom in Singapore , because the MiddCCrishas arrived .	-4.7469
In a departure house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden armreef , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of its daughters .	-4.3992
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-2.7408
Although every month she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars ( approximately EUR 1,730 ) as an administrative staff and works her husband , she does not enough monthly family income , she explains .	-4.6695
Indeed , in parts of South-East Asia – where household debt is growing – demand is so large that ValueMax , where she has exchanged , was the third detention house this week listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-4.3316
Putting jewelry is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as favorable as an unsecured bank loan . the of . , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.9064
Pfandhouses in Singapore typically require an effective annual rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same shopping centre .	-3.6090
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that there is no need to review creditworthiness or proof of income , which is why loans are faster than banks can .	-4.9568
That is why millions of people in the region turn to default houses after families feel the pressure of rising costs of living , as well as increasing household and consumer debt .	-3.9370
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis and cheap credit , owing to easy fiscal policies in the developed economies , families with lower and middle-income seek default houses to compensate for the difference in terrible economies .	-4.9604
This week , the credit rating agency called Standard & Poor 's growing budget debt , mainly through rising mortgages , a risk factor for the creditworthiness of Asian banks .	-3.1208
Malaysia , Thailand , and Singapore , according to the Agency , have the highest level of budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-3.4097
Malaysia , at 80 % of GDP , is at the top of the list , an increase of 60 % in 2008 .	-2.7928
Economists are also worried about Thailand ’ s high levels of consumer debt , which emerged scarcely this week from a technical recession .	-3.4020
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing export weakness and a decline in consumer demand .	-3.3341
“ In effect , this means that , with rising costs , people in the middle to the lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-3.6291
Historical highs in gold prices over the last two years have increased the trend towards pledging personal objects , as people use the opportunity to turn the family 's jewellery into cash .	-4.2985
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged items are in the 200 deposit houses of the city state of gold .	-3.7239
People say , “ The price of gold looks good , let us pledge Grandmother ’ s gold chain and return next month . ”	-3.1090
The largest Thai department house operator , EasyMoney , has experienced a 20 % increase in its branches in recent months .	-3.3460
Growth in the deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the Bendemeer branch and 15 others in Singapore , wants to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia , where the company operates four houses , but also outside Asia , according to Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.2076

Rescue package over $ 325 million in Australian Health Care	-2.6272
The Australian Government insists on the hard conditions associated with the rescue package of more than $ 325 million in Australia ’ s health care system to ensure that the federal government cannot waste the money .	-3.8143
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will “ take immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.4086
Funding for a four-year period was decided after government consultations with the independent Tasman Member Andrew Wilkie .	-3.1063
“ The government has created an emergency rescue package that we believe addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” Plibersek said today .	-3.4538
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for electoral serv.	-3.0178
Other 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for grey star , are intended to eliminate residues .	-3.8142
There is also money for daily clinics in Hobart and Launceston , better aftercare for stationary residences , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-3.6851
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected clinical workers have told me that they are the best way to improve the Tasman health system , ” Tanya Plibersek said .	-3.4253
The Minister insisted on the Tasman Government 's strict reporting and accountability .	-2.1600
The federal state must maintain the current level of funding in order to obtain money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where the additional funds have been spent .	-3.9174
A three-man Commission will be set up and will ensure that the state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.3597
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would benefit little if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the Tasman public health system on a more sustainable path . ”	-3.0801
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-2.9857
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the worry list , ” said Wilkie .	-2.9947
According to the federal government , these electoral benefits will largely compete with recent cuts .	-3.0096
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is only a “ pavement solution . ”	-3.1456
“ We are in today ’ s position because the laboratory government has deducted $ 430 million from the health system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.0955
It is unacceptable for a government to tear almost half a billion dollars out of the system and for the Commonwealth to go into 300 million and then pretend to be good news .	-5.0309
Dutton called for Pliberseck to guarantee that not one dollar of the rescue package will be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.5798

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such as a surveillance group	-2.4355
Syria destroyed important chemical weapons and toxic gas munitions , the global chemical weapons surveillance group declared on Thursday , while serious clashes occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites where allegedly toxic substances are stored .	-4.1754
On Thursday , a Syrian activist group also announced that more than 120,000 people had been killed soon three years ago since the civil war began .	-8.7537
The announcement of the Organisation for the Ban on Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline	-6.1854
1 November , which the organisation based in The Hague set Damascus to destroy all facilities for the manufacture of chemical weapons or “ inoperable ” , including all machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling of ammunition .	-4.4506
The completion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syrian chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-2.8506
The destruction of institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.0798
But Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-2.7931
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senfgas and nerve gas sarin .	-2.8956
The announcement came at a time when fighting in the city of Safira on Thursday , experts say that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and storage facilities , as stated in the United Kingdom ’ s Syrian Observatory on Human Rights .	-4.2835
On Thursday , Thursday , 120,296 people died through a network of activists in Syria .	-2.8673
Of these , 61,067 are civilians , including 6,365 children .	-6.9570
On the part of the government , 29,954 of them belonged to President Bashar Assad 's army that 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.2795
Also among the dead are 2,202 deserted army soldiers and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.1755
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011 .	-2.2194
This figure has not been updated yet .	-3.2510
The conflict has forced around two million people to flee the country .	-6.3608
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of which have links with al-Qaeda groups .	-2.6994
The observatory said that on Thursday there were losses on both sides , but there were no details .	-2.5481
The struggles underline the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a deep civil war .	-4.1309
According to the OPCW , which works closely with the United Nations , the team “ now convinces that it has seen all the important production and mixing / filling facilities mentioned by Syria and has seen their destruction . ”	-4.4993
That is why “ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment . ” , , , or .	-7.9501
Earlier this week , the inspectors explained that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the sites specified by Damascus .	-3.4593
Because of security concerns the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .	-3.3936
On Thursday , OPWC declared that , according to Syria , the two sites had been “ abandoned ... and that the Chemical Weapons Program objects there had been relocated to other mentioned facilities inspected . ”	-4.1115
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit the OPCW inspectors .	-2.5098
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved by the OPWC 's executive committee next month .	-2.8781
“ I take care of the bravery and the courage you have shown in fulfilling the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Monitoring Organization , in a comment published by OPCW .	-4.1478
For three years now , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels have been fighting against Assad ’ s government in this civil war and their security forces , which are many members of the Alawites , a secession of Shia Islam .	-6.8725
As regards further developments , the head of the observatory , Rami Abdurrahman , said that on Wednesday there was a strong explosion in an air defense facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-3.6241
The cause of the explosion is not known , he explained .	-1.9842
Anger of Bali ’ s Bombs ’ Judgment	-3.6959
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died during the Bali bombing in 2002 were angry at the judgment of the last of the incitement to be brought to justice , as Umar Patek believed that it should be shot by st.	-5.8748
Patek , who was on flight for almost ten years as one of the most sought-after people in Southeast Asia , was sentenced yesterday for his role in the construction of explosives for the bombing to a prison sentence of 20 years .	-4.8625
With criminal execution , he could be made redundant after 15 years .	-3.0958
The 45-year-old was found guilty of the mass murder because of the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist district of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.0794
A debt was also made in a series of terrorist-related charges , including a wave of explosives in churches in Indonesia on Sanctuary evening in 2000 .	-4.0504
The Public Prosecutor had called for a lifelong prison sentence , even if it could have applied for the death penalty for the man who , because of his reputation as a masterpiece of bombardment , would have been called “ demolition man ” .	-5.0934
The decision has awakened painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39 years old twin daughter Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-conspirators almost ten years ago .	-4.0846
With tears she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.1733
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-1.6222
“ One should put him before a shooting command , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-3.3374
I have to live every day with no more grandchildren and I will never see my daughters .	-3.4051
The Sari Club was equated to the ground , when on 12 October 2002 , shortly after 23 p.m. , a huge bomb exploded in a small laster that was parked in front of the night club .	-5.7455
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber exploded a backpack filled with explosives .	-2.9378
He fell into a coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times , while he dropped from a life support system .	-4.8154
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.4692
Really , this type should be given the death penalty above all .	-2.6926
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.8808

Patek is the last Bali bomber to be tried .	-2.0393
He withdrew almost a decade of arrest , but finally , in January 2011 , in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just under four months later .	-4.0439
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.3233
“ He did not stand up , ” Corteen said .	-2.1390
Until recently , he has shown no repentance for how much suffering he has inflicted on other people .	-2.9020
The judgment came before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , commemorated with commemorative celebrations in Bali and Australia .	-3.3809
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.4222
Patek may appeal against his verdict .	-2.5119
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment in aircraft ( but do not conduct mobile phone calls )	-2.9750
Air passengers can now use their electronic devices to read , work , games , music and use the image of films , but not by mobile phones , so the new guidelines published by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA on Thursday .	-9.0064
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.3086
How quickly they would be implemented depends on the respective airline , FAA staff Michael Huerta declared at a press conference .	-8.4091
Airlines must prove to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new guidelines and that they have updated the training manuals of the air staff and the rules governing the consumption of equipment in accordance with the new regulations .	-4.8784
The FAA stated that it has already received plans from some airlines that want to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.7580
Delta and JetBlue were among these airlines .	-2.0248
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could authorise the extended use of electronic devices very soon , ” the FAA announced in a statement .	-3.5383
Passengers currently need to shut down smart phones , tablets and other devices when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.1945
They can only restart them when the aircraft reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-3.7552
When landing , passengers must shut down and must not restart them before the aircraft has landed .	-4.8192
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft were safeguarded against electronic disorders could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at start , landing and rolling fields , the FAA explained .	-5.1508
Most new traffic aircraft and other aircraft converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.7268
Laura Glading , President of the Professional Association of Professional Passengers , welcomed the changes .	-2.2762
“ If the new regulation is certainly implemented – and we are working closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” said Glading .	-3.2618
Frankly , we are sorry to have to feel like watchful on this issue .	-4.1069
Nevertheless , internet connections for surfing , exchanging emails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .	-3.6107
Passengers are asked to place smartphones , tablets and other devices in flight mode .	-2.6980
So still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines for refusing to shut off the device while the aircraft was parked at the plane .	-4.4981
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be stuck , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-3.4656
Mobile calls during the flight remain prohibited .	-2.5737
The Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) does not belong to the FAA .	-2.9785
FAA may lift certain electronic devices on start and landing .	-2.7086
Last month , Mark Rosenker of the National Transportation Safety Board , safety expert on CBS News , said that mobile phones would still be regarded as a risk .	-3.6901
“ Cellular phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmission masts , ” says Rosenker .	-4.4468
A consultancy committee of the industry , which was created by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow for wider use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.8086
In recent years , the pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on the use of the and .	-3.7093
Critics like Missouri ’ s democratic Senator Claire McCaskill believe there are no valid safety reasons for banning it .	-3.6784
Restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of equipment has become omnipresent .	-3.4172
Some studies have mentioned that up to a third of passengers have forgotten or ignored the switching off the device .	-4.0404
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic equipment by air travellers after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment had become known by passenger carried out UK radios , which were the latest technical trend .	-5.6477
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed in such a way that the FAA authorises them to make no difference to electronic interferences .	-3.9424
Airlines have been offering passengers Wi-Fi for several years when the air height is reached .	-3.9932
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more vulnerable to interferences .	-3.1567
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , said Huerta .	-2.9546
Today ’ s electronic devices generally give much less radio than previous generations .	-3.0007
E-Reader , for example , only gives off minimal radiation when rendered .	-4.4500
But when downloading or sending data , the transmission values are stronger .	-2.1917
Amazon.com advocates relaxing the restrictions on the use of equipment by passengers .	-3.2296
In 2011 , company employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-readers and made a test flight to identify problems , but could not discover .	-3.9696
Members of the FAA Consulting Committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using devices .	-2.2332
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believed that the devices disruption is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.8861
Other committee members said that there were only individual reports of pilots who talk about disruption of aircraft systems by the devices , and most of them are very old .	-4.1442
However , the committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange for passenger switching off of equipment in bad visibility for instrument landing .	-5.1852
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a reasonable adjustment for travellers , who today would be extensively equipped with technology .	-3.5652
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.5097
Released Bird Rescued by North Sea Bohrinsel	-3.3320
A bird flown by air rescue service to the coast , which had been exhausted on a North Sea borinsula , was released once again into . , , , , , and .	-7.9054
The water rall was flown last month with a helicopter to Aberdeen , where it was packed up by the Scottish animal welfare organisation SPCA in its rescue centre in Alloa .	-3.8773
Colin Seddon , head of the Centre , said : “ This water rall was probably a winter bird from northern Europe , stopped by strong winds across the North Sea . ”	-3.8914
Apparently the exhausted bird looked for refuge on the borinsel .	-2.7734
He added : ‘ He could no longer fly on , so we were contacted with the request for help ’ .	-3.0174
In their release , the water rall was again fit and healthy .	-2.6746
Is Europe ’ s Elite prepared to do business with Britain ? , , , or , , , , , , , , , and . , , of . , of , , ,	-9.7246
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those who care for prosperity and work in the UK want to change in our relations with the EU .	-3.0751
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-3.2482
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders , representing about British business sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.5035
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.7854
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while the EU stagnate .	-3.3630
They want governmental connections to countries such as China , India and Brazil to be favoured rather than stopping with the long and hard process of reforming obscure EU institutions .	-4.5102
When asked about their view on certain legislative issues – from antitrust law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control over these key competences should be brought back to Westminster .	-4.9848
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , because , according to companies , the cost of the Brussels rules would now exceed the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies who traditionally are the most pro-European .	-4.7505
Finally , and probably most says , our consultation with economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course towards changing the agreement , and a relationship with the EU based on trade , not politics .	-4.8897
This recognition , found among companies of all sizes and leading corporations , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the set of action back to Britain .	-4.4273
A lot is at stake – changing the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU in a referendum .	-3.8517
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership .	-2.9809
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power back to Britain from renegotiation .	-2.7219
A better deal for the British economy is possible , and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone moves toward closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.2477
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain , as the result of our survey shows , which means increased attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulations .	-3.4416
Alexei Miller of Gazprom refers to pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era	-2.8456
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the start of one of the biggest European energy projects , explained by the Gazprom bo. the , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.5484
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : building work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said the Chairman of the Executive Board of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.4951
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.8679
South Stream is supposed to increase the diversity of Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.0631
A contractual dispute between Gazprom and its counterpart in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , creates an increased risk of conventional routes , as official says .	-4.1285
Miller said that the direct link with Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ forever . ”	-2.7750
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at low-cost rates when the entire project starts in 2015 .	-3.1648
According to Gazprom , construction works in other subordinate countries are scheduled to begin on the planned route at the end of .	-3.1812

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff accused of alleging Jonathan Lord for sex crimes	-2.7632
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were accused of sexual crimes relating to children before 2011 of charges against the child carer Jonathan Lord of Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for sexual abuse of children told .	-4.5255
But in the opening declaration before the Commission , the YMCA stated that ‘ the organization never had to deal with an incident of sexual abuse of children ’ .	-4.5979
Managing Director Phillip Hare was interviewed on a case in which a YMCA employee was charged with child pornography crimes , and another in which a sports teacher of YMCA Caringbah Hall 1991 had been condemned for abuse of entrusted children .	-5.4920
Hare said , Gail Furness , a lawyer assisting the Commission , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-2.7038
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that ‘ there have been external reviews of the YMCA in which the YMCA was recognised as the front front for child safety ’ .	-4.7578
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.5859
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , acknowledged that the management failed “ from me down ” in Lord ’ s recruitment and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of child safety policy .	-10.3107
Lord was sentenced to twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA at the beginning of the year .	-3.5291
He was sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.4212
But Hare disputes that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s violations of child safety .	-3.8536
The staff said they had observed infringements , including that Lord was alone with children , served them as babysitters , let them sit on his lap , to one said that he loved it and let children play with his mobile phone .	-5.8910
Danielle Ockwell , whose chief executive , Lord , had asked for training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child service provider Jacqui Barnat , who was Lord ’ s superior in YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and , most of the time , very unacceptable . ”	-5.9301
The Managing Director said he would not accept statements made by employees that they would not have dared to refund their superior mes.	-4.0471
Instead , he said , her friendship with Lord has affected her judgment , which is why they would not have reported it .	-3.8917
Hare explained that he told the Executive Board of YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization had to learn from the “ Jonathan Lord Incident ” concerns “ not reporting ” by employees , and the Executive Board agreed to it .	-4.5603
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations shortly after the accusations occurred was taken by the Managing Director of the Child Services of YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-3.9517
He said that this should prevent contamination of evidence , but that was “ overzealous ” and badly implemented .	-3.7080
The YMCA NSW was not safe for children at the time when Jonathan Lord was employed there between 2009 and 2011 , declared Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , Expert for sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-3.6492
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , verification , incorporation , training and supervision of employees .	-3.4051
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-1.0606
Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but acknowledges that a comeback is unlikely .	-2.8643
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his leaving office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-2.8546
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided expressing an opinion on British politics , and his comments are mostly confined to foreign policy and his role as messenger of the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers .	-4.8416
When asked whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted in London ’ s Evening Standard : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-4.4307
When horse show experts found themselves in droves in Cardiff to make the horse of the year , they knew that a hard competition was going on .	-5.0459
But none of them was prepared for the three-year old Fenton Kirkland . , .	-9.2499
The knirp , which is not even in the kindergarten and made its first steps only a few months ago , and its Shetland-Pony Toffee went loosely through the three rounds and won the first prize – with 30 opponents left behind .	-6.1966
The inseparable couple , both equally large , were praised for their performance , behavior and style in the annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-6.6938
During his appearance in competition against men and women with elegant melons , he had put up his plate cap in a cheeky angle and led the two year-old Toffee through the ring .	-5.6482
Fenton was praised by the judges for his natural skills in dealing with the pony far above his age .	-3.4022
And Toffee received best notes for his performance and his personality .	-2.5865
Fenton had received Toffee as a gift to his third birthday last March and since practised Shetland Pony every day .	-3.6572
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great player . ”	-2.1917
They had to compete against the whole field of participants and got off the course with gold and rosette .	-4.7795
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-2.6217
Full strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-2.7835
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his Aunt Sharon Howells , which has been showing horses for over ten years .	-3.4988
Howells told us : “ The whole audience was like electricity , and everyone fired and clapped it . ”	-3.8861
He ran on sand all the length of the arena and although he looked so tiny he did a fantastic job .	-3.5180
Fenton is crazy about animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens to care for .	-2.6616
As it is started , it will not take long for it to be on the “ horse of the year ” show – and I am sure it will do well .	-3.6955
A spokesman of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.9745
Together they are a great team .	-1.1469
The jurors evaluated Fenton and Toffee after how well they beaten and presented in the demonstration ring .	-3.6674
They pay attention to good collaboration between Pony and Leader – and there Fenton and Toffee were the best on .	-3.3333
I am sure that Fenton 's sweet clothing has contributed its part to making this fit perfectly for the occasion .	-4.0224
China ’ s Newspaper ’ s Call for Reforming	-3.2870
A Chinese newspaper , which called on the front page to release a reporter charged with defamation , was to be reformed , declared a press regulator .	-3.2621
The Neue Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call for the release of journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.2227
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports about a part-state firm .	-3.3761
Now the New Express is subject to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulator declared .	-8.9641
The “ Rectification Order ” was published by the Guangdong Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and TV .	-6.9505
Preliminary investigations showed that between September 2012 and August 2013 , the New Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several incorrect reports on the listed company Zoomlion .	-3.3334
“ The editorial management of the New Express was disordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-2.4779
She said that she decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporter license . ”	-3.4860
In addition , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to carry out a full rectification of the New Express and recommend that the relevant leaders be identified at the New Express and immediately checked the New Express leadership team . ”	-4.7018
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities in a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-2.5286
Having been arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-2.6830
But then Chen appeared on state television and admitted that he had published false reports against payment .	-3.2123
“ In this case , I damaged zoomlion , as did the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he explained to the state news channel CCTV .	-3.2104
I did so primarily because I was on money and fame .	-9.2728
I have realised that I have acted wrongly .	-2.5937
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page , declaring that it failed to review the reports correctly .	-3.8165
Various well-known suspects have recently made concessions on television .	-2.8640
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced , despite changing the law at the beginning of the year when the authorities were banned from forcing someone to accuse themselves .	-3.2658
Drug Tunnels Discovered by rail between the US and Mexico	-3.3072
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electric rail operations , has now been discovered .	-2.9126
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages ever found .	-2.5729
The tunnel that runs in the zigzack pattern over a length of almost six football fields connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.4158
There are countless unknown warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide trucks loaded with drugs .	-3.7704
The tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized , the authorities declared it .	-2.5556
Eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured during the discovery of the tunnel , so the records of the court .	-3.5452
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as drivers were charged for the property and the intended sale of marijuana and cocaine .	-8.7711
They are threatened with prison sentences between ten years and for life .	-2.7004
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels .	-1.8909
The tunnel is the eighth large passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-1.8739
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after the marijuana harvest in Central Mexico , which poses the challenge of bringing their product to consumers quickly .	-3.6925
In 2010 , authorities found an almost 640-metre long passage with rails that ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-7.2787
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr Still Love	-1.3130
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate paths in the future .	-2.8644
In an interview , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-1.9145
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn .	-1.4744
Actor Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-1.7983
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes does not run exactly as we plan or hope it " .	-3.7707
Kerr and he himself still loved , emphasized the 36-year-old .	-2.4272
" We will support each other and love each other as parents of Flynn " .	-2.2311
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their sons were born Flynn .	-6.4743
According to Lexica , vegetarianism is subject to vegetarianism , but it is very different from that one .	-3.9655
Because while vegetarians allow the consumption of cream torts , ice or a powerful Edam , these worrys are not on the menu of a vegan .	-5.3535
Milk , cheese , egg , besides the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan leaves the consumption of animal products - honey is denied .	-10.1377
What remains to be asked , but if you look at it , the vegan food world is characterized by a considerable level of ingenuity .	-5.1625
" Brota spreads are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local House of Reforms , who has a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.6287
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop in the Domgasse .	-2.1713
For 13 years the native New Zealand has lived vegan , in Lampertheim he finds everything he needs to live . " In 1997 I changed my diet and became a vegetarian " .	-4.5930
At the turn of the century , the next step was taken and I became Vegan .	-2.2451
" The conviction came not only because of nutrition but because of the choice of footwear , " says Proctor , who prefers art leather .	-4.1770
He recognized that it also goes on in other everyday matters without animal products .	-4.1379
Vegan is primarily an ethics .	-1.9063
" I don 't want animals to die for me , " Proctor expresses the maxim of vegans that extends to the whole consumer behavior .	-3.8814
Instead of mourning burgers , stirrings or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered new products , the enthusiasm increased .	-3.7866
" It 's a double bonus , " Proctor says today , " in fact vegan is not a waiver , not an askesis , but an enrichment " .	-5.4461
And it was precisely these conditionations that led some of the well-intentioned attempts to fail .	-4.8537
" The addiction factor is a crucial factor that allows many to give up quickly , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-4.4983
And it turns out : ' Some tastes are not to be fixed on the animal ' .	-5.7760
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make the taste .	-7.5735
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " explains the vegan .	-3.5623
Proctor brings with it a barbecue festival such as Aubergines , Champignons and a few vegan sausages .	-4.4979
He pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , which is definitely intended to taste heav.	-6.2090
Of course you want something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.6226
" It should taste , but this is not just to reduce animal food , " says Proctor .	-3.2250
He did not suffer health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption .	-2.2685
I had a positive aspect of the changeover .	-11.6426
I am not taking a foreign cholesterol and I have an increased vitamin share .	-3.3148
There are high-performance athletes who feed exclusively vegan .	-1.7495
" My blood values are excellent , I often let myself check " , betrays Proctor .	-3.4712
In particular , many vegansimus critics warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-2.2838
" Since animals are nourished with feedingstuffs rather than grass on pasture , it is questionable whether in the meat you buy in the cooling sleep the vitamin B12 is high , " Proctor finds .	-5.4806
Vegan also has the possibility to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.6725
" My B12 values are in order " , he explains .	-2.0014
Large ways should not go for food procurement .	-3.4103
After all , basic foodstuffs are available everywhere and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-3.8945
I find everything I need on .	-2.3660
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-2.8819
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but that is how it behaves in " ordinary " completed products , as we all know .	-5.4716
Without this , the preparation of vegan dishes is much cheaper and less time-consuming than is commonly assumed .	-3.7036
" There is a lot to discover in the house kitchen , with a few small tips you can achieve good results if not partly better " , says Proctor .	-4.4458
Margarine instead of butter , a little more baking powder and carbon acid instead of eggs , with its vegan cheese cakes , Proctor was also able to amaze his parents ' sile.	-9.6214
The vegan gives a new season for family celebrations .	-3.5985
That is what dynamism , when you cook together , is of new importance .	-4.3266
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " Proctor says .	-7.5503
Of course , he has already been sceptical .	-2.9052
Do not taste my meals anymore ?	-2.6947
" Should I feel bad now , because I drink milk ? " - when it comes to such questions , you have to act as a vegan with a sense of finger .	-5.2973
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to deadline any enclave .	-3.5509
And , more precisely , the world of everyday life does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not seem as constrained in everyday life as usually assumed . .	-9.4525
Also fast food is allowed .	-1.3954
Pommes everywhere !	-2.2978
" Many döner shops offer Falafel , or even a vegetarian yufka , " says Proctor .	-3.1711
In a pizzeria , it softens on pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , everything a matter of habit .	-11.6420
The restaurants look so slowly at it .	-2.9747
" When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was much more difficult , " the New Zealand can find a development : " You have to talk to the people , to make them aware of it . "	-5.3673
" If there are enough demands , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , " he hopes .	-2.9487
Vegan restaurants develop , such as the combo in Mannheim or the café bird free .	-4.0021
Proctor hopes that other restaurants will at least have a vegan menu .	-3.2147
Basically vegan dishes are there for everyone .	-2.3584
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-1.9529
" Meat dishes are exclusive in the true sense of the word , because they exclude others , " says Proctor .	-2.8729
" If you want to avoid food scandals , veganism is a safe way to make the greatest part impossible from the outset , " says Proctor .	-3.2133
But buying vegan products could be somewhat difficult at the beginning .	-2.8595
In particular , if you learn to understand which can also contain animal additives as colors in earthnuts , you seem to be leaving the courage with respect to ethics in so many hurdles and traps quick.	-5.8370
Not only for this reason have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are supplied with food and also cleaning agents .	-3.9005
" After and after you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to pay attention to " It is sometimes better to take small steps than standing or stumbling , " Proctor knows .	-4.4056
Veganism , it is an important moral fingerpoint that beats awareness .	-2.8489
Perhaps he is not entirely able to discard his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to challenge his habits critically .	-4.3757
Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath .	-2.0849
Nasdaq Options Market trading was interrupted on Friday afternoon in Ger.	-8.9156
In a communication , the operator blamed technical problems .	-2.0496
The other 11 US option markets , including two of Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-1.8097
The recent incident continues with the stock market operator a whole series of smaller and larger margins .	-2.9164
Only on Tuesday , the Nasdaq indexes were not charged for an hour for errors in data transport .	-3.5513
In August of this year alone , there were two breaks in one week .	-2.7025
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs sent mass defective purchase orders to option markets due to technical problems .	-3.3167
As a result , stock market operators nearly needed a whole day to view and delete the orders .	-4.0661
Two days later , half of the entire stock trade in the US came to a halt due to a computer break on the Nasdaq stock exchange for several hours .	-3.3714
Furthermore , last year , the Facebook Stock Exchange caused attention .	-4.0872
Nasdaq systems failed to grow the flood of buying and sales orders , later determined the SEC stock exchange supervision and spilled the company into a record penalty of $ 10 million .	-5.0634
Constance : Cyclists Have 63 Years	-1.7692
According to the police , the accident occurred when a 26-year-old man was on Thursday evening , at 22 p.m. with a ladies ' bicycle on the left hand side of the station in the direction of the market center .	-6.9605
Suddenly a 63-year-old man from a restaurant went on his way , according to the police , the bicycle driver could no longer stop in .	-6.3268
During the following collision , the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall , went to the ground during the course , and an approximately 15 centimeters long wound went to the head .	-7.3169
A rescue car team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment .	-2.8887
Assange ’ s British Police Display	-2.6490
The British police have today passed an extradition notice to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked for asylum .	-3.5869
Scotland Yard declared that the 40-year-old Australian had been called upon to “ face up , ” which called on him to appear in a police guard , and added that if he failed to do so , he threatened to arrest him .	-6.0599
Assange is threatening to extradite to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence , having exhausted his possibilities under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his objection to extradition at the beginning of the month .	-3.7584
Since he fears that Stockholm will extradite him to the US , he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London on 19 June , asking the South American country for political asylum .	-3.3412
Scotland Yard “ sent a 40-year-old man an invitation to face up to a police guard at a time we elected , ” a speaker declared .	-11.8890
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail .	-1.9067
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police invitation .	-6.8704
Assange fears that he will be delivered to the United States by Sweden and charged with possible spy accusations after publishing more than 250,000 diplomatic news on the WikiLeaks revelation website .	-4.6169
Drivers who were left with 210 km / h and hot drinks between the legs receive 1,000 <unk> punishment	-3.8534
A driver was imposed on a penalty of 1,000 <unk> because he had driven up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs .	-3.9212
Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree .	-2.7704
After the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage between his legs .	-2.5868
Before the Colchester court , Howie knew himself guilty without having driven the necessary care and attention .	-3.6320
He received seven points and a six-month ban on driving .	-2.0050
Howie was also sentenced to pay 90 <unk> and a victim surcharge of 100 <unk> .	-3.1278
Tax on Foreign Real Estate Against London ’ s Speculation Bubble	-2.0341
The Treasury has provisionally calculated the CGT measure , but it is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne , who had imposed a stamp tax in the 2012 budget of 7 % on homes costing more than two million pounds , and annual fees for buyers who hold apartments as a company and not as individuals .	-5.0482
Already , the revenue from stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which were 708 million pounds in the 2012 / 13 tax year , taken together revenue for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the Northwest , Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-4.7832
Cook said : “ After the stamp tax increases on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention , it is difficult to claim that high-quality properties are too low , regardless of the effects of the obsolete community tax system . ”	-4.7255
“ But this step could make some foreign investors more restrained in terms of buying real estate in London , or preventing owners from selling it , ” he added .	-8.4181
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – in the wealthy south-west belt of London , which extends from Fulham to Wimbledon , has increased by the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-4.8687
The prices in Central London had an even annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as an investigation by Savills .	-4.4620
Scientists were able to give more light to the context in which the tail of a dog with his mood is linked .	-4.4519
Previous research showed that happy dogs went with the tail more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while nervous dogs were the left side .	-3.4472
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-1.9091
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ Humans know well that the left and right half react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative emotions . ”	-3.3608
Here we have tried to look at other species .	-2.2528
He also noted that , in dogs just like in humans , the right brain half was responsible for the left side movement and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-4.2198
To learn more about how dogs react to the lateral tail of their species , researchers monitor the animals while watching other dogs ’ films .	-4.9307
They measured the heart rate of the four-legs and analysed the behavior .	-2.5090
We will probably soon understand why the tail moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-3.2123
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We showed the dogs films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we managed the tail ’ s movement more to the left or right . ”	-4.0333
When the animals saw how an otherwise expressless dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wedeling dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-4.1820
But if the tail inclination was primarily to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog who went ) , their heart frequency rose and looked troubled .	-5.4293
According to Professor Vallortigara , dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .	-11.4858
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience on which movements they should worry and when not .	-3.9742
He said , “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the tail is linked to a rather friendly behavior , and the right is more likely to produce less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-6.1636
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to improve understanding of their animal 's emotions .	-3.8877
John Bradshaw , an expert in dog behavior and guest hostility at the Faculty of Animal Health Academy of the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study investigating whether left or right is important for dogs .	-4.8033
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn the head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .	-3.6040
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ Dogs go to a robot dog rather than being tail <unk> left , rather than becoming troubled – exactly the other way than in the Italian study . ”	-5.4516
According to his statement , the differences could result from the fact that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or robot dogs as dogs .	-3.7753
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-1.8716
“ Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-3.6272
But since their behaviour is easy to record , it will probably not take long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-4.2578
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow because of Alex Turners disease	-2.8246
The rock band Arctic Monkeys postponed an appearance in Glasgow after her lead singer was sick of throat infection .	-3.5490
The band from Sheffield should play in the hydro on Friday .	-2.1848
Because of the disease of the lead singer Alex Turner , however , the concert must now be laid .	-4.1424
The band 's announcement came after she had to move an appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-2.9977
In a statement on its official website , Arctic Monkeys announced : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening , and on medical advice , the Arctic Monkeys must also cancel the show at Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , 1 November . ”	-4.5109
“ In Alex Turner , a throat inflammation was diagnosed , which is why it is unfortunately unable to occur . ”	-4.0556
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham is now taking place on November 20th , which was relocated in Hydro in Glasgow to November 21 .	-3.9475

In February , Pope Francis appoints the first cardinal cases	-3.4039
Pope Francis will first appoint new Cardinal inhabitants of the Catholic Church on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.0495
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who choose a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-3.7828
There are currently 201 cardinals .	-1.5902
However , a cardinal that reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ eligible cardinals . ”	-3.9067
In a statement in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman of the Vatican , said that there would be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony for the appointment of the new cardinals , which is also known as a consistent body . , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.8494
“ Pope Francis decided to announce his decision to convene the Consistent Board in February in advance so that other meetings requiring cardinal participation from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-3.6100
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinals eligible to vote probably declined by February .	-3.8967
He declared that a Pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary so that the number of cardinals eligible for voting is again 120 , and as many cardinals as he wants to .	-11.6506
Next year 's consistency is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , says Valero .	-3.0748
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and Italy in particular .	-2.3856
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinals from the rest of the world to restore the balance , ” he said .	-2.3357
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.3232
The Cardinals will also be the first to be called since the Cardinals Council founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world , which have the task of finding ways of reforming the Church .	-4.5978
In the past , the Pope decided it all .	-2.0394
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-2.5082
He explained that it was “ well possible ” that Francis asked the cardinal.	-9.8057
But we have not been in a position to date – that is all very new .	-3.4652
Valero said that typically bishops from large places would be appointed to cardinals , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints . ”	-3.4308
GM Calls New Pickup Trucks in the US to Repair the Seat Repair	-3.1663
General Motors calls back nearly 19,000 of his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup Trucks with construction year 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , so a communication from the US regulatory authority on Friday .	-4.9337
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for depositing the front seat rest .	-3.6687
That is why they do not comply with the Federal Guidelines on vehicle safety on head restraints .	-3.4527
“ When lifted from behind the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so there is an increased risk of injury ” , was read on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-4.1027
The recalled models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.4368
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the leading American car manufacturer ’ s most important model start since insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-3.6541

Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-1.9764
I am currently reading a terribly sad book .	-1.3999
It is a book I thought it would stop me during my second year of medical studies and give me hope again .	-4.8875
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes the Memoiren Barack Obama as presidential election in 2008 .	-3.3878
When I finished my patient labels in the evening and go to bed , I return the book to a time when politics was inspired by millions and breathing a speech .	-4.7394

Switching back to the present is a malicious awakening as if you are torn out of a dream .	-3.6661
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed possibilities .	-7.3594
In fact , in the years since I first cast my vote , something has changed .	-2.2850
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-1.8957
I recognise the great and versatile things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced concealment of homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-2.8759
I agree that the party political blockade detactics have overturned too many efforts to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.1657
But , having defended countless times the Obama administration against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my explanation attempts .	-3.5133
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.4255
Republican blockade policy cannot explain why it allows foreign leaders to tap or kill innocent children by overseas drones .	-2.9914
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data about American private life and why whistleblowers are punished , reveal government misconduct .	-3.4143
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , has been murdered without trials , nor why public financing and spending limits will be circumvented during the presidential elections .	-3.4888

The mining magnate , which is in judicial dispute over the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 tax , gave the claim that it wanted to ask questions about whether it was in conflict .	-5.5786
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether the CO2 and mining taxes are deleted or reduced .	-3.2310
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and that the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws .	-2.5330
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not it receives holidays , ” said Palmer .	-4.2698
Two months after the election , the Palmer Election Commission officially declared Palmer 53 votes ahead of the new count as the winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat .	-3.4560

RBS Suspends Two Foreign Traders	-1.6771
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , so two people familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global regulatory investigation into the alleged manipulation of the currency market is swiftly on the way .	-5.0880
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they are working with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market , where US $ 5.3 trillion changes every day .	-3.7380
The two traders would be the first RBS employees to be suspended in the extensive investigation that the scandal surrounding the Libor Interbanking Trade .	-4.3432
The Bank , which made no comment on suspending , confirmed this month that it had received requests for information from authorities .	-3.2269
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-2.7116
Last month , individuals close to the situation indicated that the RBS has forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a previous dealer to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-4.1870
This trader , Richard Usher , had left the RBS in 2010 and is now said to have been authorised by his current position as European Head of Forex Spot trading at JPMorgan .	-4.5849
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading at Citi , was told this week and Matt Gardiner , former senior currency trader at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.6845
None of these traders were accused of any misconduct .	-2.4263
The Instant Message Group of Usher included bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup , said the situation close to people .	-3.6205
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority Finma had declared that it was investigating a suspected manipulation of the foreign exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-3.7786
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss competition authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently concerned with allegations that bankers should have agreed to transactions on the currency market .	-4.0294
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also initiated internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said familiar people with the situation .	-2.6101
Banks struggle through instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-2.8167
The news of these investigations has turned traders into an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment bank trading units in recent years , but this year has been under pressure , because low volatility in currencies limits the chances for speculators .	-4.9846
Some bankers have tried to downplay the affair , saying that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.4218
A leading trader noted that , despite the huge daily volume in foreign exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to “ influencing the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-4.9098
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she announced this week to a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after causing a loss of almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-3.4526
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-1.7452

Prior to the BI action , a transparent message was sent with the message ' We are ' .	-4.9673

In conversation with many passers-by before the site , it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city project will be better for many , although not a few of the same questions have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-5.9851
But they are beginning to resign because the city continues to delay these answers , it is called the BI .	-2.9790
As was said , public statements by the mayor have an impact .	-4.2048
At the municipal meeting in May , he said that he feared the exit for the thermal bath , should the population vote against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow during the citizens ' decision .	-5.4342
For this reason , some seem alarmed , while others regard it as a ' bumpy blackmail ' attempt by the population , it is still stated in the press release of the BI .	-6.5765
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .	-2.3166
Rangnick Schiris ’ s Road Man	-3.4664
As satisfied as Ralf Rangnick is with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , so disappointed the sports director of the " bulls " was shown by the referees .	-4.9592
" There is a dangerous tendency for man and Alan to be pushed into the category of Swalbenkings , " he took the two offensive wirblers in protection on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-3.9309
Recent reason for Rangnick ’ s criticism was yellow for Man at 3 : 0 against Val Gardena last Sunday , in which Senegalese became a supposed actress – who was not , of course , as the TV images show. a of , , , and , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.6756
" A crazy misdecision , " said Rangnick , the judge of arbitration Harkam called " totally overwhelmed .	-4.7668
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Grödig Trainer Adi Hütter after the game .	-3.5357
He defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved the same way in every single situation as Roger Schmidt .	-3.3211
Schmidt himself does not want to have had any contact with his colleague after the skirmit with him .	-3.8256
I do not know why .	-1.0115
" For I am the one who was insulted , " the 46 year-old emphasised . .	-8.2762
In view of the success story , Rangnick gave his praise .	-4.6105
'There are only two words for this : correct good ' , he stated .	-4.1966
There is not much to suspend .	-1.4082
Above all , the way the team plays is impressive .	-2.1368

Supreme Court Confirms Obama ’ s Health Act	-1.3238
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the health law , closely linked to Barack Obama , is constitutional .	-3.2174
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act ’ s individual mandate – forcing US citizens to take out health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the government ’ s tax authority .	-3.7042
The chief judge John Robert was on the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy chose .	-3.3555
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of comprehensive law , and also took the view that the provision of the Health Act that states would either have to extend the conditions of access for Medicaid , or would otherwise delete all State Medicaid subsidies , was not unconstitutional .	-6.6056
The action against the law was taken by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.3954
The law was firmly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the 2012 pre-election campaign .	-2.5154
Norway : Norwegian Light Mirrors	-2.2744
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village brought light into their gloomy valley .	-2.8568
Due to the low degree of sunshine , the Rjukan in the Vestfjord Valley usually descends in the shadow of the surrounding mountains from autumn to spring .	-4.8366

Ten years ago , the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to draw rays into the valley with mirrors .	-3.1827
However , this idea has been in place since 1913 .	-2.9388
After several years of debate , the City Council finally adopted the 5 million Kronen ( approximately EUR 615 000 ) expensive project .	-3.7436

Mail Little Sundays	-12.3702
" Many citizens will not have noticed yet that the red points for the Sunday blank are still at various letter boxes in the core city and the districts , but you read the small print on the yellow containers of Post AG , you quickly find out that the void on Sundays is no longer taking place " , the FDP notifies you .	-7.0513
A FDP request confirmed this .	-1.6546
On Sundays and public holidays , emptied only before the post building on Ernst-Ludwig Strasse 36 and on Jakob-Müller-Strasse 1 in Hüttenfeld .	-3.9750
Whether empty in Hofheim and Rosengarten is still empty on Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP request .	-3.8311
The social and youth spokesperson of the FDP , Fritz Röhrenbeck , is trying to laugh here .	-13.0534
Sunday blanket is an important postal service especially at appointment mail .	-3.7431
" This undertaking , despite the price increase in letters on January 2013 , is radically and unreasonable " .	-3.3092
Thomas Bittner , Liberal Group Chairman and City Association , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that , in this case , blanket times are being changed or deleted ' .	-5.4816
The postal service is a long way from the citizens ' proximity .	-3.1353
" At least the letter boxes in the Neuschloss and Rosengarten districts must be emptied again on Sundays " , says Bittner and Röhrenbeck unisono .	-3.8017
The same applies to the nuclear city , especially non-mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a Sunday empty mailbox .	-9.5330
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration is planning talks with the post on this matter .	-3.9923
Mayor Erich Maier answered that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.5945
His knowledge also exists on Sundays in Hofheim .	-3.6601
Your party supported privatisation .	-2.4867
" Then decisions are made elsewhere , " said Maier .	-1.5595
Frankfurt ’ s Park Charges Growth	-3.8225
Parking in Frankfurt could soon become more sensitive .	-2.3902
This morning , the magistrate of the city discusses a template by Stefan Majer ( Green ) .	-3.9248
Parking fees should therefore be increased by 50 percent .	-2.7112
This is not to increase prices , but to reduce the time interval between parking clocks and automatic parking ticket machines from 30 to 20 minutes .	-5.1528
In December , the Municipal Assembly will have to decide .	-3.4129
The Retail Committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this ' not a good idea ' .	-2.7510
The parking facility in front of the shop is " an ununderestimated advantage for smaller dealers " .	-5.1298
Germany 's Transport Club believes that an increase after two decades is ' reasonable and actually long overdue ' .	-3.3060
Public transport also becomes more expensive .	-1.9615
Town of Freudence : Rapid Actions Curby of .	-5.5892
With a narrow bath , the men I of the TSV Freudenstadt in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen took over the TG Gönningen from the Schwabian Alb .	-4.2961
Although the Elbler stood with an experienced team on the other side .	-5.1229
Soon , however , it became apparent , age-related , that it could not fully compete with the rapid actions of the joy cities .	-5.7619
The Gönninger were extremely difficult to deal with the hard and placed premiums .	-5.4370
They repeatedly missed the passports and attacks that were cleanly passed by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz , and were not present at the block defence .	-6.0307
Two high first sentence profits clearly expressed the superiority of the Freude Cities in all matters .	-4.0454
Given this overwhelming and play-determining performance , the third sentence was won somewhat lax and loudless to the 3 : 0 final ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-5.1954
On November 2 , the TV Baiersbronn , which was clearly able to prevail in Nagold , will be a much more powerful opponent on the field .	-5.6450
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Palchen , Stefan Reller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-2.2025
The second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstown were in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-4.2940
They delivered a tough two-hour match .	-1.9966
Nervosity on both sides caused errors and points , especially in the ball adoption ; even in passports , the precision was sometimes deficient , and in some critical game scenes the overzeifer prevented the gaze for possible point gains .	-7.4141
In this highly balanced encounter , however , the TSV team at Marcus Blasutto was entirely in agreement with the great physical efforts and a pleasant commitment of both teams .	-5.8553
Day of care at the Little English Hut	-2.6406
A group of dedicated participants met with the small English refuge in Ibach .	-3.7556
Due to suggestions from the population , this day should be released in the area of the hut the view into the valley , said Mayor Helmut Kaiser .	-4.1599
Many hikers , according to Emperor , described this area as the gloss of the gorge , where the landscape offers the ideal setting for wonderful views .	-4.8991
He thanked the present for their willingness to collaborate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument for strengthening the link between man and nature .	-4.2149
It offers every citizen the opportunity to emphasize themselves in nature .	-3.5314
At the same time as the tourist aspect , environmental consideration can also be taken into account .	-3.4514
Friederike Tribukait explained this ecological aspect by the Nature Protection Department of the Freiburg Government following the welcome of Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the auspices and wished the action a good success .	-4.3645
According to Tribukait , the tourist objective of the vision is to preserve the strongly grown old Allmendweid field with its specific protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the still existing pastures .	-5.5084
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass butterflies , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest areas .	-2.4632
These free links are needed to maintain birds .	-3.6461
Tribukait said that she did not want to fail here to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-8.1059
The current measure is not only seamless in this planning .	-9.3712
A biosphere area also provides an opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development on the basis of internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous supplement to the future achieved with the Life project and with the days of care .	-10.3720
After these various designs , Revier Christoph Wehle and Life Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff split the helpers into groups .	-3.6498
The larger trees had already been beaten in advance , the forestry trawler may be ready to call .	-4.0421
A group of helpers should take care of the exemption of guard bushes and the maintenance of a dry strip .	-4.0602
The aim was to look at the prospect freely .	-4.3772
Löffingen : Heads still the only candidate	-3.4425
Information on the Internet : Although the Baarsmith Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children 's , youth and senior politics , as well as its own city works can be called an attractive city , no second mayor candidate has yet reported .	-5.0451
The only candidate for the succession of mayor Norbert Brugger , who was no longer candidate for reasons of age , has hitherto been celebrated by the 46-year-old bank businessman and operator Dieter Köpferer from Löpingen .	-5.9374
The application deadline expires on Monday 11 November at 6 p.m.	-4.9328
Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nortel patents	-2.1951
The group , which has thousands of previous Nortel patents , took an avalanche of complaints on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile manufacturers , including Google , the company that was outbidden in the insolvency auction of nortel .	-5.3918
Rockstar , the consortium that bought the nortel patents for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringements before the US District Court in Texas .	-3.1509
Rockstar is owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-1.9007
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .	-1.6587
Patents related to technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , so the complaint that affects the core of Google ’ s search engines business .	-3.9511
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-2.1314
Samsung , Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google 's Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft mobile products .	-3.0990
In 2011 , Google issued an initial bid for nortel patents over $ 900 million .	-3.0829
Google increased its offer several times , last but not least $ 4.4 billion .	-2.3310
After being offered to the nortel patents by Rockstar , Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also partly motivated by Motorola ’ s library of patents .	-14.0838
“ Although Google failed to acquire the patents of action at the auction , Google has infringed and continues to infringe the patents , ” says the action .	-10.4724
Rockstar calls for a high compensation from Google , as it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is intentional , so the accusation .	-3.6306
Egypt ’ s First Free-Elected Presid	-3.2770
Mohammed Morsi is sworn off , but his day of triumph should not mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt .	-3.3238
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn as the country ’ s first freely elected president , and thus took the succession of Husni Mubarak , who had been displaced from office 16 months earlier .	-4.3670
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi also became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth leader since the fall of the monarchy approximately 60 years ago .	-2.9486
He placed the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes , whose headquarters are on the Nile and found an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.7253
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” Morsi said in the solemn ceremony that was broadcast live on state television .	-3.1144
“ Today , the Egyptian people laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy , and stability , ” said Morsi , a US-trained engineer , and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been sharply targeted by the government since its foundation 84 years ago .	-4.4432
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen watch the building when Morsi arrived in a small autoconvoy shortly after eleven clock .	-9.5288
Only a few hundred followers had gathered before the court to juggle the new president , and unlike the Mubarak presidential Prunk , traffic was only stopped shortly so that the Autokonvoi could cross the usually lively road linking the city centre to the southern suburbs .	-5.4758
As the Brotherhood ’ s uncharismatic “ substitute wheel ” , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and a Friday speech , in which he presented not only as a candidate for Islamists , but all those who wanted to bring to the target the efforts of the 2011 insurgency against authoritarian Mubarak .	-4.8739
“ Egypt is a civil , national , constitutional , and modern state today , ” Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red ribbon , declared to judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he sworn office .	-4.5975
Later , Morsi joined the University of Cairo , where he was supposed to make his inaugural speech .	-8.0588
He was officially welcomed by an army chapel that played the national anthem he listened to in pigeon .	-3.9901
The military leader Feldmarshall Hussein Tantawi was present .	-2.0629
During his arrival he was welcomed by hundreds of present in the largest hearing hall of the university with speakers from “ The Army and the people are a hand ” .	-4.4228
The University of Cairo , built in 1908 as the bastion of secular education , became a high castle of Islamist student groups in the 1970s .	-2.8193
On Friday , Morsi deposited a symbolic oath on the Tahir Square , the birthplace of the insurgency that led last year to the end of Mubarak ’ s authoritarian rule , and vowed to reclaim presidential powers that the Military Council had taken over from the office .	-4.1924

Rapid in South Africa : Two life-loimprisonment	-2.4445
Nine months after the brutal rape and mutilation of a 17-year-old girl in South Africa , the perpetrator was sentenced to life twice on Friday .	-2.3245
This was reported by the SABC channel .	-10.9490
The victim died later on from the consequences of serious injuries .	-2.7026

The 21-year-old Anene Booysen raped in an industrial site in Bredasdorp near Cape Town in February .	-2.9510
Doctors struggled for the survival of the victim , but in vain .	-2.7305
The view of young people was so horrible that carers and sisters needed psychological assistance .	-9.7704
Kana had admitted during the process that he had been in a bar with boyses during the night .	-4.4925
He also admitted to beat and raped them , but he disputed being responsible for the death of the girl .	-3.3629
The police initially assumed several perpetrators , but dismissed two suspects because the evidence against them was not enough .	-3.0083
The Public Prosecutor also stressed during the process that she was convinced that Cana was alone at the time of the attack .	-2.8914
Rapes are almost everyday in South Africa : there are approximately 64 000 advertisements annually for sexual violence .	-3.4260
That is almost ten times that of Germany , but with 82 million people , it has a much larger population than South Africa ( 50 million ) .	-3.6869
However , in the case of sexual violence , the police and women 's associations in South Africa appreciate the dark rates of 10 to 25 times .	-4.4235

You thought travel agencies were belonging to the past thanks to the Internet ?	-2.4376
Flight Centre seems to oppose the trend .	-1.6416
The company has increased its profit prospects for the entire year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the United King.	-3.8237
Travel companies are now expecting $ 325 to $ 340 million in adjusted annual before taxes , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in their previous forecast .	-4.8932
When current targets are achieved , that means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record gain of $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .	-10.4885
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre earned eight percent profits in the first half of the year and bought a strong start to the second half , particularly in Australian and British private business .	-4.0135
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are well on the way to record revenue before interest and taxes , ” he said .	-4.1202
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which typically belong to our strongest profit providers .	-3.3706
In Australia , the leisure industry recovered in the second half of the year , offering a slightly weaker business travel market .	-2.9602
Similarly , it was good for Flight Centre ’ s recreational business in the UK , while business customers spent less .	-4.3721
The US business recovered compared to the seasonally weaker first half of the year , so that for the third year in a row a profit is expected for the entire year .	-4.8784

Tomorrow , the Ministry of Education will publish the new curricula for English and Mathematics – the first subjects that have been radically transformed .	-2.8641
Other core companies will be changed next year .	-1.8442
In a separate initiative , Ofqual , the Supervisory Authority for Verifications , will announce a reorganization of the GCSE structures , including a new demand system and less course work .	-3.9463
In a summer speech , education minister Michael Gove said that there is “ a broad consensus that we need to reform our audit system to restore public confidence , ” emphasising that the GCSE would become “ challenging , ambitious , and stricter . ”	-4.0758
Studies show that less time is spent on mathematics in English schools – 116 hours per year or three hours per school year – than in most other countries .	-2.2637
On the other hand , Australian schools teach an average of 143 hours per year and students in Singapore receive 138 hours .	-2.8426
Although there will be no formal requirement to provide more time for mathematics in the timetable , coalition circles say that the comprehensive math test – combined with greater weighting of the specialist in rankings – will probably encourage schools to spend more hours .	-5.2794
The curricula focuses more on “ problems from the right life , ” including financial mathematics .	-2.2878

Salem : Johanna Rahner ’ s Ecumenical Forum	-1.9877
The next Ecumenical Forum of Conversations on Monday , October 21 , at the New Museum of the Castle concerns the theme " Zur Helle mit der Helle - Theological Considerations on today 's handling of the last things " .	-4.6659
Speaker is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.1449
The Ecumenical Forum is an initiative of the Catholic and Evangelical Church communities of Salem , the Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of Lake Constance .	-3.4064
Johanna Rahner wants to investigate in the forum how people today classify " last things " after death .	-3.0014
If people had known too much of this over the past centuries , putting on the pictures of sky and hell , " which until now shape our ideas , " the contemporary prophetic teaching characterizes the hopes of completion rather by a certain embarrassment or even language .	-9.7194
" The greater hope was executed by religious critique by Christians , " says the speaker .	-7.8446
They have ' provided us with so many question marks that the declarations seem to have lost us ' .	-4.0164
Johanna Rahner continues to say : " But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death " .	-2.9034
That connects the question of the longing that ' dreams that everything will be good at the end ' .	-5.0143
Johanna Rahner , born in 1962 in Baden-Baden , studied Catholic Theology and Biology at Albert-Ludwigs University Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-2.2487
She also received a doctorate in 1997 for Dr. theol .	-3.7369
The habilitation of fundamental theology and ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms University .	-2.7533
Since 2010 , Johanna Rahner has hosted a chair of systematic theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology at the University of Kassel .	-2.8466

Illmensee : Second mountain bike race enthusiasts	-2.4491
In wonderful weather 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to handle the round course across the hills around the lake .	-3.8992
This is what Ulrich Knobel tells us about the sports club Illmensee .	-3.5263
Among the participants , especially at the short distance over 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous wheelchairs who wanted to exercise their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere .	-4.9043
Two junior drivers of the German top class were also at the start of this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation of good positions at the German Championships .	-10.7278
These two were expected to depart from the field .	-3.9182
As in the previous year , Felix Bader could save a small time lead to the target and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .	-4.4080
Two placed Pascal Treubel again .	-4.2731
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the team of nightmares who made it to the top of the victory stairs .	-4.4056
Two and three came Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen .	-2.4677
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-3.3756
Not only in terms of capacity , the whole range of sportsmen was represented .	-3.3011
The age structure ranged from 10 years in the youngest to 70 years at the oldest starters .	-4.2793
In the main separation , more absolute topathletes were starting this year .	-3.8197
Four drivers were able to leave the regional leaders .	-10.6481
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike half professional from the Black-Tusk-Racing team .	-2.6850
Pangerl , together with a team colleague , was already two times the world champion on twelve hours driving .	-3.9385
This year he became European champion in this special discipline .	-2.2852
Roland Ballerstedt , who already names two German championships in the Duathlon .	-3.9363
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , the final of the target started in front of the Three-Lakes Hall .	-9.1361
Pangerl rasted first over the finish line .	-3.0235
Only one second behind this , the routineer Ballerstedt could secure second place in the overall rating .	-3.8603
Then , at the same time , Hermann and Warthmann came to the finish as a third of the overall rating .	-4.4698
Christiane Cohsmann was the fastest time in the ladies evaluation .	-3.8610
The second place was Areane Blersch from Binzwangen in front of Natascha Werner from Stuttgart .	-2.4188

Dr. Georges Bwell brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon	-2.0089

You can vote for him or any other hero in the top 10 to choose him to “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-3.3534
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-1.8482
For 21 years , Georges Bwell saw how his sick father continually lost awareness and travelled to hospitals who did not have the means to help him .	-8.3100
Jamef Bwell was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital city of Cameroon .	-2.8858
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation spread to his brain , causing a hematom that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.2305
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwell .	-2.0235
We would have brought it out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-1.9100
Instead , Bwell spent years accompanying his father in crowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.2892
“ It is not easy , ” Bwell comments .	-2.5991
You can leave the house at 5 a.m. in the morning and run to the hospital in order to be the first , and yet it is not the first . . . . . . . . . .	-10.1252
There are a lot of patients .	-1.4686
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.1836
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell 's father died in 2002 .	-2.0829
In Cameroon there is only one doctor for every 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-2.6494
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.3260
But even if there was a doctor for her , most of the Cameroons could not afford to visit .	-7.5325
Two out of five people live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health expenditure in the country are private .	-11.8836
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwell .	-1.7768
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-1.0304
His father and so many of his fellow countrymen suffered to see Bwell decided to do something about it .	-3.6816
Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteer have carried out 700 free operations last year .	-2.1811
He himself became a doctor and works as a surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-2.8184
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels in rural areas at weekends and offers free medical care there .	-3.7424
Since 2008 , he and his volunteer group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-1.4851
Almost every Friday , he and up to 30 people are forcing into minibuses and drive on the roof over unfixed terrain to the villages that need help .	-5.9875
It is not always smooth .	-1.5409
They had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .	-2.2208
But when they arrive they will receive like heroes : a feast , singing , and dance , and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-8.4795
In these villages free medical care is really a reason to celebrate and shaft – with its broad smile and its borderless energy – is happy with the joyful celebration .	-4.7136
The next morning the team will start examining hundreds of patients .	-2.2963
“ We treat 500 people per trip ” says Bwell .	-9.9186
They come from a radius of 60 kilometres around the village – and that is on foot . of .	-7.9825
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.3248
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.3901
Others receive crushes , donated glasses , or free birth certificates – a document required for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.0419
In the evening , the team carries out simple operations with local stunning .	-2.4540
Operations usually take place in a school , the town hall or apartment ; after the intervention the patients stand up and go into the recreation area to make space for the next .	-5.3555
The lighting for the OP and the disinfection equipment is fed by the Group ’ s generator , so Baffle and its volunteers work until early Sunday .	-5.3267
It is an exhausting pension , but the village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-8.5727
“ They drum all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” Bwell says .	-3.9997
On Sunday the team then drives back to the city , tired , but proud of the work that has been done.	-3.8284
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes an enormous difference for the people to whom it helps .	-3.6396
A man explained that the free operation of a breakthrough he received now allows him to work again .	-3.2554
" This changes the future of my family , " said the man .	-2.2243
Besides the weekend clinics and his work as surgeon in hospital , Bwell also works at night in private clinics in Yaoundé .	-3.3813
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , says Bwell ; the rest come from private donations .	-3.7965
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied medicine at Drexel University in Philadelphia in the second year and voluntarily participates in Bwelles Group .	-3.3931
He is always trying to raise money for the organisation to go to these campaigns .	-3.5766
For medical and health students such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwell , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience they would never get at home .	-4.0296
“ We can be there during operations where we help to reduce blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwell , ” says O 'Malley .	-8.8623
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.9552
Students usually pay their journey to Cameroon themselves and bring frequently donated sanitation material with them .	-3.1801
But once in Yaoundé , Bwell takes over the accommodation , transport and guidance .	-3.7259
" He is undoubtedly a hero , " says O 'Malley .	-2.5712
He devotes his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people knows no borders .	-2.3428
For Bwell , the almost permanent work is not a burden .	-3.6183
Helping others to live happier and thus fulfilling a promise that he gave to his father is a great pleasure .	-5.0137
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwell .	-2.9182
And I have in mind my father .	-1.0371
I hope he will see what I do .	-1.1997
I make it to make people laugh and relieve the pain .	-2.8637

Making the Battle Excellently	-2.2093
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novelle " The Old Man and the Sea " , Horst Janson is cut to the body .	-3.3150
Janson himself is an old hand in his metier , the acting art .	-2.2611
The old man , Santiago , cannot fool anything about fishing .	-3.3515
So the two simply add great ones .	-3.8744
It is almost imaginable to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man who speaks of the fishing young manolo .	-4.5478
If Santiago is tired of life on the chair , that is real with Janson .	-3.2625
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson masters excellently .	-3.7020
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and ultimately wins the fight against the fish by his knowledge and also his strength .	-7.7671
Janson is the sole actor on the stage in large distances .	-3.8298
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention so that his monologues are not boring for a moment .	-3.2679
Its efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the viewers forget that the sea consists only of blue illuminated water bottles .	-4.1296
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man take action in front of the fishing village .	-2.4303
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene in light : the Santiago cottage , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise favor , with her songs and their splendid voice , the sense of life of Cuba .	-6.3290
The four musicians play rhythm in Cuba and are also guests of the bar .	-2.8455
Tourism : Departure to the Romans	-1.6929
A sanitation channel from the Roman period is preserved below Cologne on about 120 metres .	-4.1388
Those visiting Cologne will not pass by the Duomo .	-3.2645
About 157 meters the two towers carry into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-4.2557
But only a few visitors who surprise the two filigious church towers imagine that there is a lot to discover under the Duomo .	-4.6676
Rainer Schulze is an expert in the field of Cologne Un.	-1.9010
Meeting point for its guided tours is the Cologne Tourism Service Centre directly on .	-9.0361
The tour starts very unspectacularly : " We start in the underground garage " , says Schulze .	-3.0796
In the 1970s , the fathers wanted an autographic city , so the remains of the old city wall stood only what was not too big .	-5.1121
For this reason , most users of the car park are running through the remains of Roman times and are only depositing their car .	-6.7511
But those who look more closely discover an archaeological site separated by metal grids in the Park D2 .	-5.0276
There are about five metres high ruins of handheld stones .	-3.8234
" It is remains of the Roman city wall , built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " says Schulze .	-3.2149
Before returning to natural light , Schulze leaves participants at the top level a glance into a dark , 15 meters deep shaft .	-5.0812
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly perceived .	-10.0262
The next station of the tour is the Pretorium , where the participants return to the depth .	-4.7887
We are witnessing here the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the CCAA president .	-3.7888
What CCAA means would like to know a visitor .	-2.0295
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which in good German means " City of Roman law and City of Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius on the place of the Altar for the Kaiserkult " .	-4.4954
The pretorium is the former Statthalter Palace , the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-8.7575
A tunnel access to the Roman sanitation channel lengths from the pre-exhibition area .	-11.8316
" You can quietly walk along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want , " Schulze encourages guests .	-4.2385
Schulze still has a surprise .	-1.2985
After taking the key at the checkout , he leads the group to a 16-meter deep , commitable shaft .	-5.1033
" We are now in the mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.7556
The Jewish community built its bath deeply into the ground to reach the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-3.7032
To date , at the lower end of the mikwe , the origins of which date back to the eighth century , different water levels can be seen by alternating levels of the Rhine .	-4.7516
The mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the town hall square , for which the construction work will begin shortly .	-3.3617
However , a few years will go until completion .	-3.4124
Recovery of rocker	-3.2457
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years .	-2.9101
A trial for attempting to death , dangerous body injury and factual damage against two 30 years has begun before the Frankfurt District Court ( Oder ) .	-5.3049
It is accompanied by strict security measures .	-1.7133
The defendants remain silent to the start .	-10.0126
They should have been active in the rocker scene and then belonged to the bandidos .	-2.9307
The Public Prosecutor accuses them of joining with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt on three men in one car in June 2009 .	-3.4574
All victims were seriously injured , a man would almost have lost his leg .	-3.0587
The victims should have listened to the competing group of Hells Angels .	-2.5817
One should have been a high-level member of Berlin .	-3.1474
It seems that precedence was a tracking hunt with several cars .	-3.2096

Australian appeals against prison sentence in Thailand	-2.4994
A 21-year-old woman from Sydney , who was sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket because she mistakenly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver , appealed against the judgment and was released on bail .	-3.5148
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on 15 June to have made a mistaken statement after indicating to the Thai police that a local taxi driver raped them in the morning hours on Sunday 10 June , while two other men held them .	-4.6790
Later , however , a video camera showed that she had reached her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend .	-3.6884
The Phuket police interrogated Bamford for two days until she was able to conceive history .	-3.1722
Until the trial , it was in police custody on the ground .	-2.8842
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a prison office with low security levels on the edge of Phuket , rather than a prison for adult women .	-3.7150
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy League , who asked the Foreign Ministry in Canberra to help his daughter .	-3.2825
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely worried ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-7.2802

Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is against a deposit of 50,000 baht on free foot .	-3.0858
In Australian reports it was read that she has made holidays in the resort of Krabi in southern Thailand in the meantime .	-5.1305
The court was told that Bamford would be represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-4.3957
However , it is also possible that , following the recent murder of the Michelle Smith travel department in Phuket , Thailand could endeavour to improve its damaged tourist image and therefore leave it .	-6.2514
