It is nervous if maps are not current .	-2.7316
Everybody who had to worry about this is aware of this because the Auto-Navi instead of a bypass showed a green meadow .	-6.1651
The historical maps of the digital Bavarian atlase , an offer from the Geoportal of the State Government , are far from current - but this is why it is very interesting .	-5.3210
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-2.1754
Then it becomes clear how cities and communities in the spread area of Munich Merkur have changed since the 19th century .	-3.3484
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patch-and-piece that one does not recognize as such e.	-9.6271
The large overview map included more detailed maps for towns and communities , so-called urposition leaves .	-4.1371
According to the Bavarian survey management , this was established between 1810 and 1864 and originated from the first survey of Bavaria .	-4.7115
Your client : Napoleon .	-0.9951
The French army leader has occupied Bavaria with Austria since 1800 during the Second Coalition War .	-2.2705
Napoleon wanted an overview of the occupied country and commissioned a topographic acceptance of Bavaria for military purposes , of course .	-2.7814
Even though the French troops eventually withdrew with the peace of Lunéville of 9 February 1801 , it was today ’ s neighbors who created the idea of a wide-ranging Bavarian card .	-4.7372
Kurfürst Max IV Joseph continued to advance the project , founded the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian survey management .	-3.8986
The original sheet for Munich dates back to 1856 and can be found on the website of the Bavarian Library .	-4.2413
The comparison of earlier / today is the most impressive of the country 's capital .	-3.6774
The city has expanded in every direction and has grown together .	-2.5098
An example of this is undersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-2.4717
Sendling was merged 21 years after the map was created in 1877 , as a district in Munich .	-3.3150
Today , undersendling lies in the middle of the city . , , , and . , .	-8.5425
The houses undersendlings concentrate around 1856 along today ’ s Plinganser road , named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian farmers ’ insurgency against Austria in 1705 .	-4.2719
Where the Westpark is today , you can see nothing as a field - at first glance : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears at the hind-zooms : handwritten numbered bills from the so-called " take-off " that derived the property tax .	-7.2846
Small parcel cells no longer occupy farmers there - but small farmers of the " land in sun " plant .	-5.2123
A large green area appears north of undersendling .	-2.6756
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the scene of Oktoberfest , was actually a meadow in the 19th century - not a concrete desert .	-3.8107
On the other hand of Isar , the historical map gives an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.2017

Yes , here on the Auerfeldstra<unk>e people once blocked people with madness .	-3.3159
In 1858 / 59 the Munich Circle-Irrenstalt " On the Auer Lüften " was created .	-5.2952
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who was associated with the death of King Ludwig II .	-3.5933
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the label of the so-called errors .	-3.6857
In addition , he prohibited the staff from using violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Museum Haidhausen , who dealt with the Institute for an exhibition .	-9.1127
280 patients had initially been seats , and then 500 seats were expanded .	-4.4349
At some point , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the Circular Institute in Haar 1905 .	-4.2646

Marienplatz was recorded in 1856 as the " Main Square " , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was called " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-4.1881
The Second World War also brought a decisive change in the heart of Munich .	-2.4298
The Allied bombs brought many holes into the city in December 1944 .	-3.2255
A big thing remained until today - at the Marienhof .	-2.9929

Civil Law Group publishes travel warning for Missouri	-1.5535
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning to colourful people travelling to Missouri due to the discriminatory politics and the racist attacks of the state .	-3.9250
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the state of Missouri , which is to enter into force until 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors and missourians to pay particular attention and extreme caution when travelling through the state , as a series of questionable , racial incidents recently occur throughout the state and are noted here , " says the group 's opinion .	-5.7675
A recent Missouri law that makes it harder for people to win discrimination complaints , as well as the state law enforcement authorities , which focus disproportionately on minorities , induced the group to issue travel warning .	-5.0726
" They have violations of civil rights that people happen .	-2.7269
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the president of Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-2.9281
'We hear complaints in such a frequency that we have not heard yet . '	-1.6250
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the United States .	-2.4915
The group quoted incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.4741
Sanders died at the beginning of the year in questionable circumstances , having no longer had a petrol during his trip through the state and was detained by the Missouri police without being accused of a crime .	-4.7855
The Council also draws attention to a recent report by the Missouri Prosecutor 's Office , which shows that black drivers in the state are 75 % more frequently stopped than white .	-4.5868
" The recommendation is that people are aware of what might happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-2.3675
'People must be prepared to bring bail money or let the relatives know they travel through the state . '	-3.7947
Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes in 2015 , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime program , which classified the state as regards the number of such injuries to the country ’ s 16th rank .	-3.5270
Travel warning is also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it more difficult to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-2.9941
Previously , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona after the states had adopted immigration laws that oblige local law enforcement authorities to arrest people for violations of immigration , which , according to the ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-3.6351
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Department of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but recently stakeholders have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.7917
Wild fence project is elementary	-3.1370
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-2.1134
The CDU federal delegates Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac gave a picture on the ground .	-3.6352
At the Rechtgrabenhof of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbach CDU village association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two Members .	-3.5093
Markus Schwendemann initially gave an insight into his company , where he manages 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplies 40 dairy cows and so many young animals and houses holiday guests in five apartments .	-4.1861
For him the " Black Forest Milk " is the alternative marketing route for his cows , says Schwendemann .	-3.2189
On the table of the guests comes only regional .	-3.4566
Since he is also BLHV chairman of Fischerbach , he called the pasture fence project " fundamental " .	-3.3339
I cannot profit in such steep areas .	-2.8091
The green area provides a lot of work , much needs to be processed with the engine sense .	-4.3913
" We are fighting with the conditions and topography here , " Schwendemann stressed .	-3.1058
In 2003 , he took over the parental farm and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if it does not run biobetries .	-4.3546
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The municipality recognized the importance of the pasture fence project and is happy about the promotion of leaders ' .	-4.0744
With costs from EUR 3000 to EUR 4000 per hectare , farmers should be supported .	-2.7810
It is hoped that this will allow the reforestation of the areas to be drawn up for a while .	-5.0570
" The greatest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how they move forward , " the mayor stressed .	-3.9378
Farmers often stand in criticism for promotion	-3.3770
In 2013 , a total of 25 participants were fenced by 11 participants .	-3.2892
The area of openness is 40 hectares , which must not be forested by at least 2023 .	-3.7152
Of the total cost of EUR 71 500 , half were sponsored by leaders , a quarter bore the municipality of Fischerbach .	-3.8861
Thus , farmers remained EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 kilometres of pasture fence .	-7.3522
" The great advantage is the durability of fences " , explained Schwendemann .	-2.5201
Kordula Kovac emphasised : ' You are doing a really good job without farmers and farmers . '	-3.8076
Peter White also stated that ' the best foods are produced here ' .	-9.6089
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state promotion of pasture fences .	-3.1112
The aim is to keep the Black Forest open .	-2.0068
The presence of a LPR funding scene is required .	-3.7166
Furthermore , the area to be fenced must not be slow-farming ( hanging over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened by afforestation .	-4.9147
For the 2018 Fischerbach Weidezaunproject , eight participants are currently running with 24 pitches that want to build almost 16 kilometres of fence .	-5.1937
The open-air space is 35 hectares , the calculated costs are more than 112 000 euros .	-3.8024
Is nothing more sacred ?	-0.6465
Now Trump ’ s White House is Liberty Statue	-2.2081
The surest sign of regime change is when they start attacking statues .	-2.2713
Americans appreciate these as well as any other - hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein at Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-3.2339
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta of CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .	-3.7452
To stay fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.5996
A Horde of boat owners and liberty imitators would have lynched him if he had done so .	-1.7368
But he attacked their importance , and especially the importance attributed to it when the famous poem of Emma Lazarus in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument , was added to its base .	-3.5394
When Miller Acosta summoned : " I do not want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that enlightens the world .	-4.1289
The poem to which you refer , which was added later and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-2.5465
Miller is factually right , but , as he put it , it is not really about history .	-3.4786
It is about contemporary resonance to the incipient words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state invites not only any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : ' Your mortals , your poor , / Your afflicted masses , who long to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your rich coasts . '	-6.0168
There was never a time when the " miserable waste " was better seen on our screens .	-2.8861
Miller did not engage in literary criticism - he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.9430
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict over America ’ s importance .	-7.6198
Lazarus - and her friends who argued for placing their words on the grassroots following their death - knew very well that they had a high.	-4.7136
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicanism by representing the female embodiment of freedom in an exploited classical picture .	-4.1203
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-3.1134
And it gives itself a very different name : the mother of the exiles .	-7.0329
The combination of the poem with the picture is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.3686
And , just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to reverse it long ago . , , , and .	-10.5546
The great strike Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John of the Baptist for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not inviting anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative that brings the American flame into the night-time world : " Lady Liberty is moving forward .	-13.4614
It is supposed to carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.1109
The torch should not enlighten the road to the United States . '	-3.1309
Limbaugh was rather unusual in this area .	-3.5689
The importance of the statue is absolutely a question of the position of perc.	-2.6676
The great imaginative act of Lazarus was to see them in the way they were seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships . of La.	-9.7675
The real issue is to see the world from the perspective of people seeking refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-2.9497
Her statue speaks to them the words of hope and welcome that they must hear .	-2.2124
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognise .	-2.7388
Their torch should not enlighten the path , but inflame the hatred that is their only source of power .	-3.5898
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black praises Scottish members of the United Kingdom Tefor the of . , , , and , in , , , , , and , . , of ,	-9.5085
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots belonged to the UK team	-8.6466
The Director of the United Kingdom ’ s lightweight athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish quota will ' make a massive contribution to the team ' in the World Cup .	-4.4256
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , starting on Friday .	-2.0975
Black believes that ' something special is developing in Scotland ' and that the United Kingdom 's athletics must learn something from it .	-3.3287
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue it until we find out , " said Blac.	-10.8024
" I speak to people at the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.2355
The Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.0011
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-1.7451
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.2530
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant ' .	-1.8462
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal candidates , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart , who will take off against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 metre route , while Eilidh Doyle was elected by the team as team captain .	-7.7171
" Eilidh is quite modest .	-1.2119
Your captain 's speech was incredible , " says Black .	-1.6444
" A number of athletes , whether they were Scottish or wherever they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and very motivated .	-2.5920
The passion and real feeling that Eilidh brought naturally was great ' .	-3.0157
The Commonwealth silver medal winner , who will join the 400-m hurdle in her fifth World Championship , says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-4.0459
Scotland ’ s previous total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven that were achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-2.7473
The middle range runner Muir is taking this path and last year has set five British and two European records .	-3.6560
It will participate in the 1,500 m and 5,000 m of running .	-2.7203
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1,500 meters , is another Scot that should be observed after a great season that included the victory at the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-4.1190
Doyle remembers her first World Championships when the only other Scot was in the team Lee McConnell .	-3.0175
The team captain says that she is " enormously proud " of the fact that many of her compatriots are not only part of the team , but in some cases will also be involved in medals and finals .	-4.4979
" The special thing about being a team captain is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was anyway a great honour , but to know that my teammates voted for me and voted for me , makes it something very special for me , " she added .	-8.4211
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots that belong to the team .	-1.7852
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.4791
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to rise on podia .	-2.5868
What about my speech as a captain ?	-1.6625
Yes , I think she went well .	-1.2598
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a World Cup .	-2.5640
So it is really important to rely on this support for homes and to benefit from the fact that we are back in the Olympic Stadium .	-4.1808
I get a second chance to go out and compete and it will simply be such a great atmosphere outside . '	-3.6820
Blocking critics about Facebook : Do not apply for a public office if you cannot contract voters ’ heating	-3.9562
The father of our country knew something of a bad press .	-1.4684
Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for the newspapers to beat him for everything from domestic politics to his political principles .	-2.4531
He swamped safely in criticism .	-2.5279
But he did not silence his critics .	-1.1445
Because in 1783 , Washington said : ' Freedom of speech can be removed - and , stupid and mute , we are being led to slaughter like the sheep ' .	-4.0845
This brings me to Maryland to Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-1.9851
Hogan 's employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who have expressed their opinions on his official Facebook page .	-2.8151
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him for this reason at the beginning of .	-1.9774
The governor ’ s staff released the complaint as frivol , and the online commentary was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-3.3136
" It 's just Facebook " , said many people .	-1.6668
But it is important .	-0.8787
And it is particularly important when it is a type like Hogan .	-2.0838
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state that is amazingly popular .	-1.7511
He has the second highest approval of the 50 governors of the nation .	-6.2939
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.1133
He has shown a firm hand in leading his state and strict observance of the principles .	-3.2169
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary tool to connect with his voters and playing his hairless head for chemotherapy on his side .	-8.0403
Therefore , the blocking of people coming to the Governor 's side - a public forum that is described as official and paid for by public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-4.6705
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogan ’ s spokesman Amelia Chasse defended the governor ’ s actions , arguing that blocking comments was nothing more than a moderation .	-2.4478
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hateful people who swing the stick online .	-3.0308
The post spoke to some of the real people blocked by Hogan .	-1.8796
And these are only real people who speak with their elected leaders : a teacher , a entrepreneur , and a parish , no trolls .	-3.3127
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not profane .	-1.6952
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogan 's Catholic faith .	-1.8542
Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md . , was not hateful , but she asked about hate crimes .	-2.3667
" I politely commented that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " she wrote in the comments section of the news program " The Post " .	-3.6128
" I do not value this idea either if a number of people take a position on the same subject , then some people disregard it as a so-called collective use and do not recognise it as a large group of affected citizens . "	-8.7495
What governor staff called " concentrated spam attack " would probably call others " advocacy .	-3.3817
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or deleting a negative comment .	-1.9968
It is much cleaner than in previous times if we had done the same thing that employees were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical editorials or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-3.6260
But that is precisely what is happening digitally .	-1.8041
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticised for embracing Facebook and other social media .	-2.2530
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.6502
One of the first milestones on this issue fell in Virginia last week .	-1.6873
The chairman of the Board of Supervisors of the Loudoun County violated the First Amendment , according to US district judge James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she banned a voter from her Facebook side .	-3.2418
And in Kentucky Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.4108
That should not be so difficult .	-1.4788
At the time of affordable porto , Washington had a similar effect to the Internet .	-2.5407
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters beat his leadership .	-2.1237
Even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.2747
People who used pseudonyms like " Juricola " , " Valerius " , " Belisarius " and " Portius " wrote all letters to newspapers that made Washington 's decisions .	-2.7777
Petitions that criticized his position on the Treaty of Amity , Trade and Shipping with Britain overwhelmed his office , according to the historical documents collected by the online papers of George Washington Project .	-3.6253
But he did not silence them .	-1.1792
Freedom of speech , difference of opinion and discourse are the basis of our nation .	-2.1802
And true leadership means accepting that .	-1.5712

Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi in People ’ s Mund , promised to address inequalities and infringements in Papua during his 2014 campaign .	-3.2901
The former Zimmermann secured 27 of the total 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-2.4104
But little has changed in Papua , and now locals feel cheated .	-2.0003

Some demonstrators began to swing stones on police and military posts .	-2.8948
When the mood was heated , the soldiers were sent a command about an internal radio : " If the masses were more than three times resistant , they shoot it dead , " it says in an official document by TIME , which was not released to the local media .	-4.8042
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , the head of the Kego Koto district of Enarotali , saw the threat of danger and called for peace and called for the crowd to return home .	-3.5613
No one was listening in the mood .	-1.3721
" When I turned around , I was suddenly shot into my left hand job , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-2.7012

The news about the killings only came the following day ' filtered ' to Jakarta .	-2.7705
Three weeks ago , Jokowi held a passionate speech in Jayapura , expressing sympathy for the victims ' families and swore to address the historical maladministration in Papua .	-3.9586
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so that it will not happen in the future , " he said .	-2.3008
Security Minister Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extrajudicial mechanism for resolving historic human rights violations .	-2.6687
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.1475
" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-1.4253
Some were in the 1990s and early 2000s .	-1.7722
The point is that we have committed ourselves to tackling these infringements , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .	-3.1327
Then Wiranto retreated when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on 5 June and said he had no plans to set up a complaint mechanism in Papua .	-3.0304
Instead , " everything is regulated by law , " he said .	-1.8833
Wiranto , charged by the UN for ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody independence vote in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations had already been resolved in Papua , including the Paniai incident .	-3.8844
Families of the Paniai victims accepted such allegations with gross infidelity .	-2.8825
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.4322
'I am tired . '	-0.5984
He says he is still living in fear for years later .	-2.6332
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.6536
'I am afraid to be arrested by the military , fear to be shot ' .	-2.4248
His brother Yacobus repeated the belief that the people of Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-7.9411
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping bury four of the victims .	-1.7651

Shootwearing has not stopped .	-7.2674
On Tuesday the Indonesian police shot on villagers in Paniais neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.0761

The police said that the villagers threw stones to officers responding by firing warning shots .	-2.3379
But locals say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) began to shoot and kill one .	-1.8022
" We were so panic , we are afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who lived close to the hospital and witnessed how the injured were quickly delivered , according to TIME .	-8.4959
'I hid myself two days in my house . '	-2.6570
The Deiyai Parliament has called for the officers involved to be held to account and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area .	-3.6072
Paniai was always a trouble for the Indonesian Government .	-1.7225
The lack of meaningful development strengthens the dissatisfaction of the tribal nationals Mee , Moni , Dani and Damal living in the green highlands of Papua .	-3.4705
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army , claiming to defend the rights of the Papua by encouraging sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-5.5827
Some of the top OPM leaders come from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-1.8442
In response to this , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily detained in recent years , under the pretext of ' securing national sovereignty ' .	-6.4614
Some never again emerge .	-2.1286
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-2.0404
Poverty reinforces discontent .	-1.5421
The bit of rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-1.5438
Bread is just as outside reach .	-2.3177
People here build everything they eat : nota and fruit and leaf vegetables .	-3.2077
Agriculture is the task of women who can handle four or five sweet potatoes each .	-2.9678
They keep the majority of the harvest for the family , while the rest is sold on the local .	-2.5713
Ten pieces of nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.4851

Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to make their own businesses competitive .	-2.9895
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... for here there are no jobs or money , " says John Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council of Paniai .	-2.8633
Isolation keeps the eyes of the world far from Papua .	-1.4890
Moreover , restrictions on the reporting of international media remain tense .	-1.9456
Earlier this year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported from Papua for lack of coordination with related institutions , despite the rare permission to film .	-2.9621
According to Phelim Kine , the deputy Asian director of Human Rights Watch , the promises of Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been real.	-8.8691
" There are new dangers to foreign journalists trying to report from Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Western Papua : visa refusal and a black list , " he said in a statement .	-3.2192
Lack of press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely confined to the immediate neighbours of Papua .	-2.7076
In March , six Pacific states - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the Marshall Islands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate " various and widespread infringements " in Papua , including the Paniai shooting industr.	-3.9266
The same countries have historically supported the OPM .	-1.3174
The spokesman of the Indonesian Foreign Ministry , Arrmanatha Nasir , rejected the group 's accusations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia , a democratic system still applies , and there is free media so that it is difficult to cover up the evidence of human rights cases ' .	-4.1521
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.5691
When an official delegation from the Netherlands , led by the human rights ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura visited Jayapura on 4 May , locals broke their silence and afflicted him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also participated in the meeting but wants to remain anonymous .	-11.8596
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they are unlikely to vote for Jokowi again .	-2.5944
" Jokowi is a person who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , Chairman of the Tribal Council .	-2.9689
He wants Jokowi to know that , apart from the fact that it lives under the constant threat of a predatory military , the Paniai people are in poor education and health services .	-2.8419
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , see their vote for Jokowi as a " guilt " that he has to pay back .	-3.1437
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.2985
Despite the threats and intimidation , families of the Paniai shot victims conducted a last symbolic act of defiance : the body of a victim was buried in a site precisely against the police and the military station .	-4.1567
They know that they may never have justice , but at least they will not forget their crimes .	-2.8364

Fire Torch ’ s Skyscratches of Dubai for the second time	-3.0853
On Friday , in one of the world ’ s highest living towers in Dubai , a fire found its screen and forced hundreds of inhabitants to flee from the 337 meters high 79-storey buildings .	-5.0063
It is the second fire that sweeps through the high house in just two years , randomly called the torch tower ( torch ) . of , , , but , of , .	-11.3677
The building was evacuated , there were no reports of injuries , and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame . .	-8.2529
" We slept and we stood up with the fire alarm and the crying of people .	-3.8352
We ran down the staircase and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor " , a resident who indicated his name as George told Reuters .	-3.3532
Dubai ’ s civil protection authorities said that the fire control units at 4.00 p.m. local time ( 00.00 p.m. GMT ) deleted the fire and cooled the building .	-4.0073
The government said she is working on providing accommodation for those affected .	-2.9183
The incident can revive issues related to the safety of materials used in outdoor areas of high houses around the world .	-4.1933
An investigation by the management of the Torch building after its fire in 2015 showed that most of the damage came from the facing , the outside facing to decoration or isolation .	-4.3623
In the United Kingdom , the police said that it believed that the plates system for isolation and facing at the London Grenfell tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which around 80 people died .	-5.1147

The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) , with its large Davis Cup coup , took place at the General Assembly .	-3.6897
At the Ho-Chi-Minh City meeting , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis Cup individuals only on two profits was not supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-4.3277
The five-set classics , which are often very long but also very highly appreciated , are therefore preserved for traditional competition .	-5.9355
63.54 % of the member countries voted in favour of reform , so the aim of ITF President David Haggerty was scarcely failed .	-7.7249
" We respect this decision , but are disappointed that our member nations did not adopt the entire reform package for the Davis Cup and Fed Cup .	-2.3351
We need a change to secure the long-term future of this iconic and historical competition , " said Haggerty .	-2.3197
We will continue to work to improve the applications .	-2.3961
After many objections , the proposal to hold the final in a neutral place did not even come to the vote .	-9.1699
New from 2018 are only comparatively smaller details : In future , the finalists in the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have host law in the following year .	-4.2696
To reduce the cost of organizers , the requirements for training places and so on will be facilitated and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-4.3328
More than 1 out of 5 US passengers bring forbidden items to the plane , finds a survey	-3.9232
A survey among air passengers showed that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items were smuggled over at the control points of the US Transportation Security Administration , including at least 6 percent who entered the aircraft while accidentally wearing prohibited knives or other items with blades .	-4.6617
Less than 1 % claimed that they had late discovered that they were mistaken with weapons , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.0497
The survey for more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers are more disregarding the rules .	-4.4166
Of those respondents who admit that they have knowingly tried to fly with something banned by the TSA , 19.7 % of the millennials were in comparison with less than 15 % of the members of .	-4.3597
The most common objects deliberately passed to TSA agents were food and liquids .	-2.6116
More than 3 percent admitted that blades had knowingly carried objects through safety control , while 2.2 percent of female surveys and 3.7 percent of male surveys also confirmed that they had deliberately brought banned drugs to the airc.	-5.7012
The company said it had asked travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggling goods would have brought through airport safety and how many would have done it intentionally .	-4.9475
It is no surprise that the people who carry the most smuggling goods - knowingly or unknowingly - through safety were those who fly most frequently .	-4.3023
However , the company indicates that the TSA guidelines are rather complicated and confusing .	-7.8631
People are often unsure of what liquids they are allowed to take with them or how much of them .	-2.9767
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids seized by the TSA are prohibited .	-2.9544
For a while , people thought that TSA could regard books as smuggling goods .	-2.0956
Liquids are permitted on domestic flights but not on international flights .	-7.2309
Elon Musk does not care : Cancel Tens of thousands of Tesla customers Order	-2.6536
Elektro-Thousandsassa Elon Musk is happy to announce the huge number of pre-orders for his new tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.2548
He has so far failed to comply with the fact that some customers have withdrawn their non-binding reservations .	-14.7297
In addition to the always triumphant figures on increases in sales and even more huge sales targets , Tesla Chef Elon Musk , announced the latest quarterly balance sheet for the first time , betrayed another , less glossy figure : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-5.5560
Musk has frequently advertised over the past few months with more than 500,000 pre-orders for the new car , whose delivery just begins .	-4.2859
Now Musk recognises that 63,000 have already been withdrawn from the total 518,000 pre-orders .	-4.0912
Critics had repeatedly pointed out that they were only non-binding reservations .	-3.2850
In case of cancellation , Tesla will fully refund the 1000 Euro ( in the US $ 1000 and UK $ 1000 ) " Reservation Deposit " .	-4.3342
Currently , 455,000 such non-binding reservations were made , and Musk received a telephone conference with analysts .	-8.6666
However , the Tesla chief does not believe that cancellation of 12 percent of all orders could become a problem .	-3.9126
His argument : the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand , but production .	-2.1404
Last year , Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.4590
In 2018 , all models taken together - 500,000 will be , one million in 2020 .	-3.7085
The demand for this is clearly there .	-2.3243
According to Musk , there are currently 1800 reservations per day .	-2.6142
Anyone who orders a " Model 3 " today can count on delivery at the earliest in the second half of 2018 - if Tesla manages to drive its brand new , never tested production roads without maximum utilization interruptions .	-5.5386
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.2344
If there are more delays , however , the non-binding nature of the reservations could become a problem for Tesla .	-3.7252
Because then the company cannot prevent dissatisfied customers from running in droves .	-3.4946
EPA ’ s Chief Pruitt Returns because of the delay in the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions	-4.2650
One day after being sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the leader of the Environment Protection Agency , took his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era rules in order to reduce emissions of smog-causing air pollutants .	-3.7670
Pruitt presented the change when his agency proved to the needs of government environmental authorities more responsively than previous administrations .	-3.2720
He did not mention the complaint that had been made against his previous post in a federal appeal court .	-3.4337
It is a deadline that expired on 1 October for states to meet the 2015 standards for ground-level ozone .	-3.4118
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year in order to give his authority more time to study the plan and to avoid ' interfering in local decisions or hindering economic growth ' .	-7.4274
Pruitt , who was President Donald Trump Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma before his appointment , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental regulations .	-3.0487
Since its arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly moved to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil fuel industry oppose .	-2.8550
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the prints regulatory rollback agenda .	-2.0477
Last month , a Federal Court of Appeal in Washington decided that the EPA administrator exceeded its authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration that obliged oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-6.8897
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt suggested that his U-turn on ozone standards simply strengthens the willingness of the EPA to cooperate with the states through the complex process of meeting the new standards in good time .	-3.7415
" Under previous administrations , the EPA has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be charged by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " said Pruitt , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-4.4380
" We do not believe in regulation through court proceedings and we take deadlines seriously .	-2.3645
We are also taking the law and the authority that exists . '	-12.9262
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPA stated that Pruitt will eventually use its ' delay power and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are based on ' sound policy and the best available information ' .	-4.6253
Congressional Republicans urge a broader recast of ozone rules .	-1.8207
A draft legislation approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.6539
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.2082
The New York Prosecutor General Eric Schneiderman , who led the coalition of states suing the EPA this week , said that the group intended to maintain legal pressure .	-3.1927
" The reversal of the EPA - according to our complaints - is an important profit for the health and safety of these 6.7 million New Yorkers and the more than 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneiderman .	-3.7571

Representatives of public health care and environmentalists cheered for surprising changes in the course of price .	-9.8548

Association Wants to have wind wheels checked	-2.9023
" Boisheim defends " sees no legal requirement for the construction and has therefore turned to the Landrat Council .	-3.3561
Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) asked Landrat to withdraw his permission for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.9660
It has been illegal .	-1.7895
The association argues that no wind power plants could have been authorised at the time of the approval on 30 December 2016 at the Boisheimer Nette , since at the time in Viersen there was only a wind power concentration zone at the border with Schwalmtal .	-4.7546
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind power plants are fundamentally possible , but the concentration zone also excludes wind energy use for the rest of the city .	-5.2301
Such zones are intended to prevent the landscape from being repar.	-4.8885
Although the city of Viersen had decided a second wind power concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette just a few days earlier by changing the land use plan , which had not been approved by the Düsseldorf district government because of a form error .	-5.7367
" The lack of a planning requirement remains unlawful and therefore unlawful for the approval certificate , " said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim defends itself " .	-5.0136
Current state of affairs : Before the summer break , the City Council again decided on the wind concentration zone in the Boisheimer Nette ; the district government has yet to approve it .	-5.0055
Erkens : " This means that the granting of permission for the construction of wind energy plants is excluded from planning law " .	-5.8770
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .	-1.7577
" The relevant letters have been received at the county of Viersen since last week , " said a speaker .	-3.8429
The circle is taking this opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-2.8962
They are not expected to stop the procedure , however .	-3.1201
With regard to current proceedings at the administrative court , the circle did not wish to express its opinion on the content of the association " Boisheim resists " on Thursday .	-4.8768
NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four wind wheels per 200 metres on an area on the Boisheimer Nette .	-3.9917
Last year , the company in which the city of Viersen is directly involved had already concluded leasing contracts with the owner of around 65 hectares of terrain .	-8.6748
With the construction of the four wind power plants , the electricity requirements of around 11 400 households are to be met - approximately one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households .	-5.2699
The NEW Re wants to invest some EUR 20 million .	-1.7414
Last summer , Viersen ’ s City Council gave the green light for the purchase of three wind turbines in the Linnich wind farm near Aachen and a participation in a wind energy plant in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg .	-4.1728
Car and tractor crashed together : Women die in the event of a terrible accident	-2.7142

City and Dealers are planning " Home-Shopping " -Weekend	-3.2245
Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region are expected to rediscover the shopping opportunities in the city centre in September .	-3.2111
The business association and the city administration want to use the weekend on 8 and 9 September to attract the inhabitants to the shopping street in the city centre .	-5.0395
As the chairman of the commercial association , Christian King , announced , the " home shopping " weekend is intended to raise awareness among customers about the offers offered by its own city outside the usual supermarket goods .	-5.9272
The plan is therefore a market with regional suppliers , similar to the weekly market .	-3.3240
Moreover , domestic companies with their training places are to be presented .	-3.2272
In addition , the shops of the city centre will invite you to " midnight shopping " .	-4.5601
The action is not only aimed at inhabitants of the city and the closer region .	-8.3380
In preparation are advertising spots on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian King .	-3.5057
Municipal administration and commercial association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-3.2091
Thus the commercial association and the city go into another stage of the project " Attractive City " .	-4.3831
These include new offers such as the first " Active Day " as well as sold Sunday , conversations with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-5.1152
Also attractive offers for Saturday and the waiver of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .	-2.9375
In addition , customer potential is to be exploited again or again .	-3.5485
These include tourists and tourists .	-2.0037
But many locals would have lost the downtown when shopping .	-4.8859
In the end , everyone would have to contribute to stimulating the city centre , including landlords , the businesses of the whole city and clubs .	-5.3149
King had said in spring that a network had to overcome the lethargy that had partly broadened .	-10.1949
Birgit Streich , head of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen announced that the German third " home shopping " day , for the first time five Thuringian cities participated in the German Thuringian Thuringian Shopping Day .	-5.6232
Besides Bad Langensalza , these are Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-2.6335
The day should ' promote the value of local trade and emphasise its importance for the common good of our cities ' , says Strip .	-4.8474
The action under the leadership of the IHK and with many partners also demonstrates that each citizen can influence their own direct environment with their purchasing behaviour .	-4.8512

A missing person was later also dead .	-3.0139
The dead were school employees .	-1.5368
As a cause of disaster , the authorities suspected working on a gas pipeline .	-2.5313

Trump put pressure on Mexico , after leaked transcripts of telephone calls for paying the border wall .	-3.2784
Transcripts of telephone calls between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.1361
On January 27 , Trump called on Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto to stop publicly saying that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.6001
The US president denounced him for publicly denouncing the wall , reporting that he said to him : ' You cannot tell the press ' .	-4.7965
Trump launched his presidential campaign promising to build a wall on the US ’ s southern border , and swore to let Mexico pay for the project .	-2.4161
Transcripts of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull were also published and revealed a tense exchange .	-2.0579
Mr. Trump said , Mr. Turnbull , that a trade for the US migrating to Australia would be ' ridiculous ' , ' mies ' and ' stupid ' , and that the existence of trade that the Obama administration has brought would look like a ' dep ' after proposing a ban on refugee resettlement to the US .	-5.7425
Mr. Trump finished the call after saying to Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-3.7285
Moore ’ s Ford Massacre : Activists return to racist lynchact as a call for justice	-2.5339
A 1948 Ford Mercury drove through a group of viewers in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumped to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-3.0205
Before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver had the chance to reach the bridge , a group of white men emerged with guns to block his way .	-8.2093
The leader of the mob - a middle age man in a stripe suit - took a long train on his cigar and looked testly through the windscreen .	-4.4368
Inside the occupants were in fear .	-1.9274
" We want this n --- r Roger ! " brought the man .	-2.0575
'Get him from the car ! '	-1.8171
Cry torn the silence when a young black man was destroyed by the front-passenger seat .	-2.9176
Fortunately , this terrible scene , which was played on 22 July , is just an addition .	-2.5940
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost everyone in the audience had very real sights .	-4.2126
Since 2005 civil rights activists have come back to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night when two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom , and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were lynched by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-3.3605
Nobody has ever been charged with murders .	-2.1925
" It is truly inconceivable that not a single person has been arrested in all these years - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps organize the postponement .	-4.9491
" It is a dirty spot on a story , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.6923
Brooks is a former Georgian congressman for 71 years and a civil rights activist .	-3.5849
For him , the follow-up serves as a dramatic call for action and is an annual reminder of the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.2184
" We want criminal prosecution , we want an end , we want healing , we want reconciliation , but first we need to have justice , " he said .	-3.4709
'We cannot heal and reconciliation until we get justice ' .	-2.0438
A medical professional laid down a sheet about the corpse of one of the victims of Moore-Ford Lynchen on 27 July 1946 .	-5.0554
According to FBI files received by the NBC News , more than 50 Men from Monroe and the surrounding counties were suspected in the lynch process .	-6.4956
But no one has ever been charged .	-1.5109
Although suspects have remained open for decades , civil rights activists say that the double motivation for lynch actions throughout the city has always been known : politics and sex .	-3.4643
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling allowed the black citizens in Georgia to vote for the first time in the summer campaign .	-3.2250
At the same time as the election , according to the FBI of the black farmpower Roger Malcom , a white landowner , Barnett Hester , stood down during a battle , allegedly for a woman .	-4.2553
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hester had slept with Malcom 's wife Dorothy and that the baby she weared was not from her husband .	-3.6142
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to deliver Malcom from prison , according to the FBI .	-2.8642
He was accompanied by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey to prison .	-1.6033
But when they moved away from prison and approached the Moore 's Ford Bridge , a lynchmob surrounded the car .	-2.5829
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " closes an FBI report .	-2.5298
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murders , eliminated evidence and covered the identity of witnesses . "	-3.8383
Brooks put it even more concisely .	-2.1621
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.7994
'You have all been killed in order to send a message to black people in this community : ' If you register and if you vote , you will be here ' .	-4.5238
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene has guided the annual succession of the Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-2.9988
Their presentation is illustrative , touching and justified in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-8.2760
It is hard to look and look more difficult , but Greene said that this is the point .	-12.9579
" We do not want to talk about lynching because we are confronted with its ugly in all of us , " she said .	-3.6250
" But I cannot build a relationship with you if you do not want to listen to me or not to hear what I have gone through " .	-3.8325
The samples for this year ’ s production started in June , and on the first day almost 30 actors – a dozen white and the rest of the black – entered a space and listened when Greene started a well recorded overview of the piece .	-4.4295
Wade Marbaugh is here Greenes Co director .	-1.5935
He has played the role of chief clan for years , but he said that the role would never be easier .	-2.6022
" I feel dirty because I am not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.5483
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-7.8573
On the other hand of the room , the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hester , tried their lines .	-6.4133
The piece begins with Malcom , shouting and afflicting him , angry that he slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.2992
'I said , n -- he disappears from my property ! '	-2.1037
Rascona returns fire .	-2.1777
There is a break .	-1.0729
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-1.7582
Greene laughs the loudest .	-0.9564
" What ? " , Rascona asked .	-1.5771
It is alarmed and confused .	-0.9142
Was I too hard ?	-1.2525
" No , " Greene said , still kilingly .	-3.1386
'I simply do not think that white people said ' n -- he ' .	-2.9213
" But " witched one of the other black actors .	-3.0103
'You only have to meet the hard ' R. ' .	-10.7039
And that is exactly where the energy shifts in the room , a sense of comradeship replaces the unease . . , , and . . , , , , , ,	-8.8683
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-2.9981
The scene begins once again .	-10.9224
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it sharply and forcefully .	-2.4632
Absolutely no one laughs .	-1.2375
This repetition ends violently and quickly .	-1.8380
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.6941
A woman , dressed with a sadness dress , stands above the bodies of the actors and performs Billie Holiday 's mourning praise " Strange Fruit " .	-3.8206
Your vote breaks with every second word .	-2.1713
About a hundred metres behind it , a group of around four dozen spectators winds out of their eyes sweat and tears .	-4.1059
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-1.6972
A couple travelled from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many come down only the road .	-2.7381
They have witnessed Georgia ’ s pressing moisture every eight hours when Brooks leads them to the tombs of the Malcoms and Dorsey on a pilgrimage trip .	-4.8693
Until that point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when one stands on the same country where lynch murders took place , the air feels spectacular .	-3.7512
When the last notes of the song finish , Greene invites the amount to come closer and inspect the body .	-3.3515
Children wake up to their heads , register fake blood and quiet bodies and whisper each other .	-3.4490
" You are not really dead , " a little boy as if he wanted to remember it . . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.5234
After a few minutes , Greene thanks the quantity - and suddenly it is over .	-2.0121
The actors throw away the lynch rope and wipe their tears .	-2.1844
Bradshaw embraced Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-2.1463
Nick Rascona embraced two of his fellow players and then breaks down in their arms , the emotional burden of performance finally breaks with him .	-4.4235
" It is okay " , whispers one of the women .	-1.8051
" We know that this is not in your heart .	-1.5062
You did so for a reason . '	-1.8997
Later , the audience competes with the actors for dinner .	-3.3526
On a table , a white couple from Atlanta chat stimulates the adjustment with a black couple that they have just met .	-4.8494
Denise Duplinski struggled to find words that left the performance .	-2.8629
" It is hard to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do that because they look like you , " she said .	-2.8725
" What really does with me let me believe that the lynch is still going on , " she added , " today it is called only police shooting . "	-4.9955
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks Hof holds on his table , he eats and reminds of civil rights .	-2.4732
He said he had already started planning the performance next year .	-2.4523
" The suggestion is somewhat inspiring , because it describes the terror of what we have endured , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-3.7159
" It is so unless we learn from it , it may happen again .	-3.6784
Anyone who does not study his own history , who does not know his own history , is conto . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.4582
The Wagnerians in Bayreuth reconciled the God D.	-3.3056
Also in the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf is putting on a bunt-frivole staging against gigantic six-storey scenes .	-4.3223
The stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) optionally shows a shabby street corner with Wall Rest and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " Plaste und Elaste " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-4.4341
Before that , an open Mercedes class car park where the Rhine daughters are positioned as rockergirls , or alternatively an Isetta .	-5.0432
Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - stacked oil barrels remind you of his " ring " staging .	-3.9230
The three daughters of the Rhine - sung by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as wonderful as in the " Rheingold " .	-3.7204

The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.4434
Stormishly celebrated Foster , Milling , Vinke and Conductor Janowski , who modest and shaped the hands to the Merkel Raute .	-4.3895
The Festival Orchestra is a great applause for the first time on stage , given the great heat again in empty leisure clothing .	-5.4971
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his registered team was exciting .	-3.6930
In 2013 , he had to go over a magnificent pipe concert , and five years later there were big calls in which the individual " Buh " calls went .	-7.7323
Festspielchef Katharina Wagner should have enjoyed this .	-2.6195
" One realises that the audience has grown together with the " ring " in a way , " she had told shortly before the performance of the dpa .	-8.8881
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf , but it was also an understanding of its view .	-7.6844

EPA ’ s Decision to Delay the Smog Rule to Claim	-3.5000
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay a regulation of the Obama administration that requires states to reduce emissions causing smog , a day after 15 states sued the Agency for taking action .	-5.1270
The EPA late on Wednesday announced the decision to advance the so-called ' ozone rules 2015 ' , and said that it showed the Agency 's commitment to cooperate with States .	-8.1222
" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA leader Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-2.8681
In June , Pruitt announced that the EPA intended to measure the ozone regulations - in which pollutant emissions should be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter air quality standards - in order to delay one year by October 2018 .	-7.8831
A group of 15 largely democratic states , together with the district of Colombia , complained on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-2.8147
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that , according to Trump , is intended to stimulate economic growth .	-3.2021
However , the efforts have triggered the setback of the Democrats and natural protection groups , which are worried about the effects of greater emissions on public health .	-4.2925
The website of EPA says that inhaling air containing ozone " can reduce lung function and strengthen breathing symptoms " such as asthma .	-3.8803
The Council wants Community Area	-3.6253
In the end , the decision was clear : in two votes against the Fluorn Winzeln Municipal Council decides to set up a community area in the future senior residential complex .	-5.0737
Before the discussion there is an important information : the contract of purchase for the lack of property is signed , mayor Bernhard Tjaden reports .	-4.4403
Although it will still take until the area belonging to the Church is local property , there is no longer any obstacle to planning for the project to be stamped by a private investor .	-6.0915
There is a discussion about a Community area for that purpose .	-2.6539
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .	-2.3030
On the ground floor , it would provide a living area - approximately 55 square meters - and an adjacent terrace with a surface area of 70 square meters for a special price .	-4.1072
The administration and the majority of the council envisage that such a Community area should not be a meeting place only for the residents of the senior-fair living , but openly into the community .	-6.4536
As an example , the word " Strickcafé " made the round .	-2.9622
The decision made last autumn by allocating funds to the current budget will be sweetened by funding .	-4.2416
Building is located in the restoration area .	-3.0001
The establishment of a common area , Tjaden reports , would be eligible for funding at 60 % of 30 % .	-11.8954
The proposal for a decision , in order to signal to the investor that we do not want to throw a cut-off between the legs in this regard , provides for the fact that saddle - which is inspired by environmental construction - and powder roof - which would reduce saddle levels and make the construction more economical .	-8.0082
Not only does Wilfried Sohmer think that this addition is unnecessary .	-3.0109
If 's help : unanimously he happens the body .	-2.8322
The Community area is not as simple as that . .	-6.7394
Daniela refers to the many buildings with which we do not make progress , for which we are now opposed to the common room from the window , she says : ' I am hard with it ' .	-6.9011
Yvonne Staiger is absolutely in favour of the Community area , but absolutely opposed to local participation .	-3.6856
It sees a hidden subsidy to already assets or even external investors .	-2.6346
That is not the case , because the purchase of the surface does not give a grant , but gets a genuine equivalent , in case of doubt marketable , is the counter-speech .	-6.0896
Staiger 's request to split the decision into line with three supporters .	-3.4624
There are two opposing votes in the original programme , which Stefan Haller summarises : ' If we take this decision in this way , we will take a huge step towards closing a huge gap in our infrastructure ' .	-4.7911

However , the 58-year-old believes in an increase in performance in the first official obligation game of the season .	-8.2649
" Football is also a tactic , strategy , personality and motivation .	-1.4843
I have great confidence that my team shows these qualities .	-1.9052

Hiking in the Hart of Star to Star	-2.7750
The nationwide first " Stars Trail " will be created in Harz .	-5.3016
The association plans to do this , Sternwarte Sankt Andreasberg .	-3.8343
There is a planetary path in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.7849
A " star path " satisfies the information requirements of many resin visitors , it said .	-4.2601
He combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-1.6138
The members want to set up the planned route tables and inform them about stars and constellations .	-4.0733
At a first phase until 2018 , the association plans " easily accessible installations at five to six locations " in Oberharz .	-3.8279
Inquiries come from St. Andreasberg , brown layer , high scale and screen .	-4.2247
The information on the boards should be supplemented by the Internet .	-2.8215
Therefore , good mobile network reception plays a role in selecting locations .	-3.3413
Accessibility is also a criterion .	-1.0342
Later on , the Stars Trail will be extended to Ride .	-4.6192
" On the Star Trail the viewers experience much knowledge , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " the association explained .	-4.4834
They also learned why stars would have different colors or why a star shined more than another , although it was much further away .	-4.0225
Also tells which constellation is in a selected star and when it is best to see .	-5.7132
Since 2014 the association has been operating the highest star waiting in northern Germany in the town of St. Andreasberg .	-4.4107
According to the Federal Office for Nature Protection , the location in the middle of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.1532
From there you can see the Milky Way and even the Andromeda galaxy with a mere eye .	-3.2857
Since 2003 , on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen Association , there is something similar to the planned star-weight - the Planetenweg .	-4.7780
Starting in front of Gebhard 's Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg path leads up to the Hainberg and the Starwart - as well as a " alien " location in Diemarden ( commune of Like ) with the planet Sedna .	-5.2487
The Stelen with the individual planets - including the pluto degraded to the dwarf planet at the end point - are situated exactly in the distance and scale of one to two billion .	-4.7468
The Earth thus shrinks to a bullet of 6.5 millimetre diameters , while the exact 75 metres from the sun measures 70 centimetres .	-4.7321
The entire distance of the Planet Trail is well four kilometres .	-3.6931
While the light from the sun to the pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to the stele with pluto .	-13.7350
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in the space . , , , , , , , of , , , , , , , ,	-7.8792
But the march to the next fixed star would last half a year .	-2.1065

" I 'm a former feather weight , " Garcia reminded .	-2.3274
" I rised for Broner [ to 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so large .	-2.7213
I am small for 140 .	-1.2584
I would like to sink down on light weight .	-2.5266
And he must move to lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.0479
That is what fans demand .	-1.8327
Let us give them that . '	-1.2373
Lomachenko agreed .	-0.7761
'Boxing needs this fight . '	-1.3514
Klimas asked whether it should be on Pay-per-View , part of a strategy that Lomachenko must fight with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 knockouts ) that also has an interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell after their lightweight title fight in the forum on September 23 .	-4.6157
" This fight could take place in pay-per-view mode because all fans asked for it , " Garcia said , and later expressed openly to fight in the network that offers the best financial package .	-4.2151
We are the best .	-0.5979
No other name can generate this type of attention .	-1.8049
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.0636
Garcia said he appreciated Lomachenko as " an enormous fighter " , and he may participate in his Saturday struggle .	-3.6436
But Lomachenko stood by the generous praise for Garcia and said that he thinked the tri-battle champion of Riverside looked " very slowly , I 'm sorry Mikey ... you wanted the co-out " .	-5.3315
Garcia said that the focus was to show strength , then boxes .	-2.2446
Both said that they could feel the momentum that built up for their own fight .	-2.4454
" This is the battle that must be conducted .	-2.4946
No other struggle creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-1.9035
I am more than happy to work on it , " Garcia said .	-1.9478
Lomachenko said : ' I was waiting for the top fighters , and that is Mikey .	-2.0654
It will be a great battle . '	-1.4581
Four Injured to Tyre Places	-1.6098
In the event of an accident on the A7 , four people were partly injured on Thursday afternoon .	-2.3796
After initial information , the driver of an Opel Zafira lost control of his vehicle at 4.30 p.m. just before the connection point market width probably after a tire placer .	-5.0862
The car switched to the right into the extinction where it oversaw and then stayed on the roof in the green strip .	-5.6731
The four occupants - two adults and two children - were partly seriously injured in the accident .	-2.1680
During the initial provision of the injured by the rescue service , the A7 was closed for about an hour to the north , then traffic could be passed on the left-hand strip at the point of the accident .	-5.9238
Fortuna 's Hoffmann : ' Triple chain works better '	-2.2803
After 2 : 2 , Andre Hoffmann hopes to start the season against Braunschweig that optimizing the defense formation will bring points to an eye .	-5.4092
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season game , with the result as well , if not the two opponents had been against Braunschweig at 2 : 2 .	-9.8896
" These were two counterparts too much , and we need to be even better careful in the eyes , " says Fortuna Düsseldorf 's defence player .	-4.8603
In the Arch Mountains the triangle chain is also to be optimised .	-4.6342
And a gateway after a free break , the Fortunas do not want to capture anymore .	-5.0108
'For the future , nobody will be taking the line next to Michael ( Rensing ) . '	-3.9148
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will cope better even after the experience of preparing the triple chain than with the four-chain .	-4.4998
" I still do not know how we will be in the eye , " says his coach Friedhelm Funkel , but Hoffmann is sure of his business , " because we have in the triangular chain at the half positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Giesselmann players who can build well , " said Hoffmann . .	-8.7276
'But it is necessary that we harmonise even better and we do not make so many mistakes in building ' .	-5.9675
Of course , Hoffmann also drives autumn to win the game .	-3.8574
" But whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw does not know .	-3.4456
The performance could well be okay , " said Hoffmann .	-2.7339
" But if we stand on Sunday with four points and can concentrate on the Cup , we will certainly be able to speak of a proper seasonal start . "	-9.6377
He did not want to know anything about that .	-2.2572
" I only judge the start in the season after six to eight days of play , " said Friedhelm Funkel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over eyes just because the Saxony game in Heidenheim had to be broken prematurely because of a storm .	-5.5014
" Now they can start the season with a home game , " said Funkel and Hoffmann believed that players from Aue might even be a little fresher , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a favorite ascent in the bones .	-5.5043
" But they don 't know 100 % where they stand , " says the interior defender of Fortuna .	-3.0469
Although guests from the Rhineland go to the meeting at last ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday as an easy favorite .	-4.5492
" That we sweep them away just because we are entitled to come under the first six is sore sense , " says Funkel , whose balance in only one defeat against the eye of nine games is quite positive .	-10.6440
" There are no teams in the second Bundesliga that you have to beat from the outset , " says Fortunas Chefcoach .	-4.4100
'Such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant ' .	-1.7434
And so Funkel does not want to experience his players on Sunday .	-2.7492
Recent results of the Swedish asylum evaluation tests and . for .	-9.3827
The recent results of tests for asylum seekers in Sweden , subject to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of tested persons are older than 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of these results .	-3.6908
The Swedish Forensic Medicine Authority ( mysterious medicinal verket ) began to carry out the tests last year .	-7.7556
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure , having criticised the Swedish migration authority ( migration chain ) for mistakes in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-5.0609
To date , Migration Verket has sent 6,880 cases to test , and the Forensic Medicine Agency has now published the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31 July 2017 .	-3.4797
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in a further 25 cases the Forensic Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-3.1303
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person is " possibly under the age of 18 " .	-2.6772
The tests will only be carried out in cases where the age of the person is called into question .	-8.7289
According to Johan Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , the results have been constant in recent months .	-2.3166
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the figures are quite constant , " he said the magazine The Local .	-2.9085
The high percentage of cases in which the person was judged over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied above his age .	-2.7694
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases " suggesting that the person investigated is 18 years or older " .	-2.8382
When the newspaper Svenska Dagbladet examined the 581 results published , she found that in 243 of these cases , the person had openly said that she would be 18 years old this year .	-3.4941
The method of medical age assessment , in which wisdom teeth and MRT images are made of knee joints , which are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , has also been criticised in some areas .	-4.6850
A sceptic is the endocrinology Claude Marcus of the Karolinska Institute , whose work includes assessment of human biological maturity to see whether they went through puberty sooner or later than normally . .	-8.3048
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not believe that the type of measurement should be used .	-2.2644
Judging biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-1.5227
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend that we could , " he said to the newspaper Metro .	-3.2401
However , Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency defended the accuracy of the tests : " Generally , you can say that the risk of incorrectly assessing a child as adults is low .	-3.5620
The greatest risk is when the person is less than 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.0801
Full in the Plan	-1.5090
Work on the three bridges of Landstra<unk>e 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.0569
On Wednesday , a seven tonnes concrete part of the bridge was installed at the eastern entrance of Lauterbach .	-3.1056
" We are very good at the time it is running super , " says Reinhold Leicht , building leader at the Road Department and Transport Department in the Government Bureau of Freiburg .	-4.4699
In April the work started simultaneously on all three needed bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-2.7036
The construction end is scheduled for October and ease is sure that the schedule is complied with .	-4.3310
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads over the Trombach .	-2.5904
It is a concrete vaulted arch bridge with red stone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-4.0755
It was built in 1900 .	-1.3641
Like the other two bridges , it has come to the years .	-2.5355
To ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now thoroughly refurbished .	-3.3520
The other two bridges lead across the Lauterbach . , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , and	-6.9899
They are made of red cover stone .	-2.7628
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve , or 10.60 meters long .	-2.2775
The bridge at the entrance to the village of Lauterbach has now received a 1.30 meters wide and seven tonnes of so-called bridge cap on the north side on Wednesday morning .	-3.9800
This is a peripheral fixing which is also used as a operating route .	-3.5449
In the southern part of the bridge a 2.20 meter bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-3.8163
This is what the pedestrian route is supposed to take .	-3.9154
The special reason is that they are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizwo .	-3.3293
The other two bridges are already equipped with the patented bridge caps .	-2.0652
Special fingertip has required the laying of lines through the building in Lauterbach .	-4.1712
Because there is also a glass fibre cable , to which many companies are connected .	-4.0046
The residents were informed about the project in the run-up to the work .	-3.1695
In addition , fish and crabs had to be fished off first .	-2.7152
For the bridges between the building and the window towards Schramberg , traffic is always regulated by a traffic light .	-4.5184
For construction works at the bridge at the entrance to the village of Lauterbach , the road in the area of the bridge at the altitude of the hotels " Tannenhof " and " Seven Linden " is ful.	-4.8183
The cost of the three bridge renovations is EUR 700 000 together .	-2.8052
It is financed by the country .	-2.3935
AfD in Gerolstein : Bunter Protest at German Potato Salat	-2.1931
It does not happen so often that parties are pulling together , but when it comes to the alternative for Germany ( AfD ) , that otherwise is hard to reconcile .	-4.8044
The CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Left , represented in the Kreisstag Volkaneifel , belongs to a broad alliance that this day shows peaceful flags , because the AfD invites the " Great Campaign " in the Gerolstein Stadthalle Rondell to the poster .	-7.3792
And well-known names are launched - like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the top duo for the German election on September 24 , and the deputy chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-5.0301
But those who are on the ground hours before the start of the event do not want to listen to the AfD learners , but to demonstrate .	-3.7069
The motto " The Eifel remains colorful " .	-2.6873
Originally the city picnic was planned under the motto " All on a table " on the Wellness Square , but now takes place on the parking lot below the cable - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-6.7248
A colourful picture .	-2.7945
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Forum Eine Welt and one of the key organizers , is really pleased : " How many people have met here " .	-4.4369
There is music and lots of food , including a " German potato salad , which the AfD could easily eat , " says the woman who brought it with him .	-4.1390
The police ordered many officials to Gerolstein , showing a presence especially at the station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-4.7749
How did the AfD actually come to Gerolstein ?	-1.9858
Mario Hompes of the AfD volcano championship reported that he tried to achieve such an event and received the surcharge .	-5.5210
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked for a refusal in Daun , but there was a refusal because there were not enough parking spaces due to the already built up Laurentiuskirmes .	-5.3706
So now the Rondell , hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-4.1141
In view of the event on the vehicle , he says : " This is the good right of people , main thing , it remains peaceful " .	-4.9373
This also happens : at 8 p.m. on the Rondellvorplatz , there is a band for entertainment in the town hall , including the Rhineland-Pälzische AfD Chairman Uwe Junge .	-6.0059
In the Chamber there are about 200 listeners waiting for the top candidate for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy chairman Beatrix of Storch to deliver their speeches .	-4.0070
The police presence is unchanged , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-2.9702
The AfD event takes a little more than an hour , guests on the plaza have a longer breath , but there too is scheduled to clean up soon after 21 .	-5.5840
The police can bridge - no specific incidents .	-7.5280

Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in European top orchestras .	-2.2102
Thus , Petkov Solotrompeter is the SWR Symphony Orchestra at the renowned Concertgebouw Orchestra Amsterdam and Frederic Belli .	-6.6124
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the borders of different genres .	-7.1888
Thus Johann Sebastian Bach sounds like in a new guy , Daniel Schnyder 's " World Music " combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the piece " Exchange Suite " of the jazz award winner Nils Wogram , blends classic , jazz and free games into a fascinating overall art .	-5.9708
This core piece of the programme was only listed this spring with huge success in Freiburg .	-3.5486
The renowned composer Nils Wogram wrote it specially for the two musicians and more : the Haslacher Klosterkirche with its special acoustics is deliberately included in the concert .	-4.5674

Coe praises " honest " Russian apologies for doping scandal	-1.8375
The global leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as an obvious excuse from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it is not the moment for the country to be resumed in sport .	-3.7600
Russia ’ s leader , Dmitry Shylakhtin , said during the IAAF Congress on the eve of the World Cup , that the banning of his country from sport was correct and that he was determined to fight doping .	-4.1976
He said he was sorry for ' all athletes who were snapped away with gold and silver medals in competitions ' .	-3.5970
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 , after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found references to state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-2.6280
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " IAAF President Coe said to the reporters .	-1.8514
" The entire Council and Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation realised with itself that it had experienced some fairly hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation was redesigned . "	-4.7124
Coe said he was also " pleased " that Russia accepts the criteria for reintroducing it .	-2.5517
" I think it was a very constructive day , and I think that progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to restore Russia , " said Coe .	-2.9919
" We must do everything in the next few months to normalize this situation .	-2.4121

Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Minister of Leyen : the operation is dangerous .	-3.0944
But he is also of great significance ' for a country that we are separated by only two states ' , she said .	-4.1590

The man of the Danish Queen Margreth ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , does not want to be buried next to his wife after his death .	-2.4088
The Royal House announced this on Thursday .	-2.5964
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the church of Roskilde .	-3.7447
The sculptor Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard made a sarcophagus for the two .	-2.2195
The queen agreed with her husband 's decision , said it further in the communication .	-7.0169
Where Prince Henrik is buried , it is still unclear .	-2.1573
But he does not intend to be buried in his French home .	-2.7867
Prince Henrik never made a hide from his title being unhappy .	-3.6959

He retired in 2016 , also laying the title " Prinzgemehl " .	-3.8599
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he did not see him as equal to his wife - not even after death , Lene Balleby , the chief spokesman of the Danish Royal House .	-4.1425
Where the last resting place of the 83-year-old will ultimately be unclear .	-3.9116
However , it does not intend to be placed in its French home , but in Denmark .	-3.1191
He likes the country for which he has worked for the last 50 years .	-1.9101

Prime Minister Weil wants a rapid re-election	-2.1828
CDU and FDP before a possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.3802
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) is in favour of a rapid re-election of the country 's day after the loss of the red and green majority , but he does not want to withdraw .	-4.1281
Because , on Friday , Parliament was in favour of the dissolution .	-3.0260
Previously , the surprising exit of a Green MEP from her Land Day Group in Lower Saxony had plunged the government of Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) into a serious crisis .	-3.1986
Five months before the official election date , the red and green coalition in Hanover lost its scarce one-vote majority in Parliament to the opposition from CDU and FDP .	-3.2307
Previous Green MEP Elke Twesten justified her move with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-3.3247
" I see my political future in the CDU , " she explained on Friday in Hannover .	-1.8715
CDU leader Björn Thümler wishes to recommend his group to accept them .	-3.1155
Thus , CDU and FDP would have 69 seats in Lower Saxony , SPD and Green together .	-3.2962
So far , the relationship has been reversed .	-2.1939
The new land day will be regularly elected on 14 January next year .	-6.9014
Thümler said that the red-green government must now decide whether it can govern without a majority in this situation .	-3.2402
However , Stephan Beil considers it essential that the country day decides on its self-resolution as quickly as possible .	-4.0067
The CDU Group is expected to decide on its further action on Tuesday .	-2.0198
The National Constitution also provides for the possibility of the Prime Minister 's day of business withdrawing his confidence and electing a successor .	-4.6934
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.1647
These opportunities must be clearly examined by law , " said Thümler .	-3.5847
'All questions will be discussed in peace when they are legally reasonable . '	-4.2020
Thümler called Twestens step " but a little curios " . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-11.2433
The politician himself stressed : " I am not a traitor .	-2.0725
I feel very good ' .	-0.9720
She was a supporter of black and green .	-2.6292
The Greens called on the dissenting Members to return their country 's mandate .	-3.6978
" Naturally , we assume that she will return her landday mandate , which she has received through the green list , with immediate effect , " she informed the national chairmen Meta Janssen-Kucz and Stefan Körner .	-5.6681
The Group Chairman of the Greens / European Free Alliance Anja Piel said : ' We regret the decision of Elke Twest extraordinarily ' .	-3.6225
You have decided not to have a debate in the group .	-3.5470
'Even against the background that there were no differences in substance , we cannot understand this step . '	-2.9896
SPD Chancellor candidate Martin Schulz condemns the transfer of Dutch Green MEPs Elke Twesten to the CDU as betrayal .	-2.8970
'The behaviour of former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal to voters , but also betrayal of Rot-Green ' , wrote to Facebook on Friday by the Head of Social Democrats .	-4.4311
He supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to quickly re-elect the country ’ s day .	-2.5933
The Twestens exit costs the majority of Red Green in Lower Saxony .	-3.4096
The politician puts her personal interests in her injured vanity and in her frustration for the benefit of the country , " criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Salvation .	-5.1919
" It is a scandal that the CDU , in Lower Saxony , is participating in this dirty intrigue game and trying to beat political capital " .	-3.9387
Lower Saxony ’ s CDU leader , Björn Thümler , wishes to recommend that his Members admit Elke Twesten to the CDU .	-3.5282
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Oppermann , accused Twesten of distorting the result of the 2013 election with personal career thinking .	-4.9755
At that time , the CDU was strongest before the SPD , but the SPD and the Greens had a small majority of one voice in the country .	-4.6190
Minister of Agriculture in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poison celebrations , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.5756
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-1.1315
How could the scandal happen ?	-1.1528
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.8546
Secretary of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) interviews with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) speech and answer .	-3.1054
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves against poisoned eggs ?	-1.4802
I can only encourage all consumers to look carefully at the eggs in your refrigerator and check the stamp print .	-3.2431
On the consumer protection portal www.Lebensmarnung.de , the federal states submit the latest information about the egg-charges concerned .	-5.1894
Eggs affected should be destroyed or returned .	-1.6220
Even if , after all we know at the moment , a health threat is practically excluded .	-3.4638
Does Aldi take on the best possible crisis response - all eggs out of offer - because the Federal Agriculture Minister 's central role is not really perceived by the Federal Minister for Agriculture ?	-4.0907
Food monitoring is the task of the federal states .	-2.2014
Nevertheless , my house has immediately opened and has been in close exchange with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany was affected .	-4.5106
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.9712
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are traffic capable and healthy .	-3.9307
If eggs exceed the maximum residue level of 0.005mg / kg , they are non-traffic .	-3.3538
However , unpolluted eggs can be sold and eaten .	-2.4546
This time , farms are not to blame .	-2.0884
Do production companies and consumers seat in the same boat ?	-2.8974
According to the current knowledge , production facilities are not directly at fault . of .	-11.6011
Instead , they must expect economic damage because of the presumed illegal practices of service companies .	-3.7976
As always , in the emergency , there are too few controllers .	-8.1756
Is it only missing from staff or from coherent competence ?	-3.2192
It was precisely the official controls that revealed the process .	-3.7427
The truth is , however , that food fraud and criminal energy can never be ruled out 100 % .	-2.4859
It is precisely for this reason that consistent information on such events and handing over to the public prosecutors in cases where crimes may occur is crucial .	-5.0031
I have made it clear on several occasions that I expect the responsible authorities to have full information .	-3.2037
Is regular alarmism in food scandals really necessary ?	-1.8875
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and transport food .	-2.8900
If an unauthorised insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indignant .	-2.3773
The means being put in place have put manufacturers , traders and consumers in a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-4.2723
Basically , it must be clear that the illegal use of insecticide Fipronil in the attitude of food suppliers is unacceptable and must be brought to an end immediately .	-3.8455
This must be consistent and highly pressurised at all levels .	-3.0392
I expect all the competent authorities to rapidly and completely clarify the matter .	-3.4893
How the Financial Rules of Football affect Neymar ’ s Move to Paris	-2.4915
The rules aimed at preventing unhindered spending by European football clubs will not disturb Neymar ’ s record transfer from Spain ’ s Barcelona to French Paris-Saint Germain .	-3.5298
Any consequences will come from UEFA for Paris Saint-Germain , because the leading organisation that supervised the European game has the power to ban teams from access to the prestigious Champions League tournament .	-3.8344
Financial fair play rules launched by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG will eventually have to prove that the transfer of Neymar was financed without major losses .	-3.5695
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to purchase the Brazilian out of his contract , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to $ 10 million per year .	-6.7634
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-1.3785
PSG can certainly relax the money to sign Neymar and put it into a galaxy of other stars , given the funding of the team by the energy-rich ruler family of Qatar .	-4.1514
Associations are allowed to spend a great deal of money on acquiring players , but must control legitimate sources of revenue that allow them break-even point in their football business .	-4.5676
FFP was designed by Michel Platini after his election to UEFA president in 2007 .	-2.2071
Former French players believed that societies that had borrowed enormous debts in their quest for success would effectively fraud and risk ruining when banks or owners withdrew their support .	-3.7354
In 2011 , FFP shifted from focusing on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-1.9388
The change meant that the business model that Roman Abramovich originally used in Chelsea in 2003 - bought a club with potential and then invested strongly to improve the team and build a global brand - should become a tougher matter .	-3.3682
During the current three-year FFP investment period that runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-3.2360
And , despite Platini ’ s disgrace from the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , continues to deter excessive expenditure .	-3.4005
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly reinforce the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-3.1255
Although the PSG has paid the Neymar buy-out clause in a flat-rate , it can distribute the amount for the accounts over the duration of its contract .	-3.8199
Neymar has signed a five-year contract so that the replacement sum for the next five years can be expelled at EUR 44.4 million in the annual financial stat.	-4.1100
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi owned by Manchester City , hit the PSG with the most severe sanctions .	-2.8357
The PSG received a fine of EUR 60 million ( $ 82 million at that time ) that was reduced to EUR 20 million later - and it was arranged that the team members for the Champions League of the season 2014 / 15 remain limited to 21 players instead of the normal 25 players .	-4.3948
UEFA is searching for clubs that could try to overrun their financial supervision by inflating their revenue by companies associated with the owners of a club .	-4.3902
While a Catarian company could sponsor the PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed standard market rates , UEFA would not allow this to be considered a legitimate income .	-13.4116
This was exactly what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA sponsorship was bloated by Qatar Tourism Authority .	-2.8560
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar on payments from the World Cup 2022 .	-2.9434
But PSG and Qatar 2022 have disputed that Neymar will become World Cup ambassadors and that such a manoeuvre could be easily identified for UEFA regulators .	-3.5529
The sanctions against PSG so far mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to observing any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.8078
UEFA had no preparatory discussions with PSG about Neymar 's transfer , said on Thursday the people familiar with the situation .	-2.9092
They spoke to The Associated Press on the condition of anonymity , because they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-2.6864
The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with sales of EUR 542.4 million , achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-3.6966
The accounts for the last fiscal year have yet to be published .	-1.8263
PSG expects Neymar 's arrival to be a blessing for sponsoring deals , merchandising and trict sales .	-2.8041
The association expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-2.5723
The Spanish league was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent Neymar ’ s withdrawal by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-3.3965
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's ultimate ownership of PSG .	-2.9800
Arsenal Manager Arsenal Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La Liga against a state that finances an association .	-3.0155
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , " said Wenger on Thursday .	-2.4995
" Once a country has an association , everything is possible .	-10.7970
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair play because you can go different ways or have different interests when a country has such a large player to represent a country . '	-3.8508
Swiss Looking for a New Chogging Supplier	-2.9984
In recent years , Chocolat has produced Frey board chocolate for Swiss .	-3.4889
Now sweet cooperation is coming to an end : the airline is rewriting it .	-9.7922
Swiss-Speaker Meike Fuhlrott confirmed on request of the news agency sda a corresponding report of the newspaper " Northwest Switzerland " of Friday .	-3.1787
According to current planning , the airline will sign a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-2.0138
Products would be checked every two to three years and subject to quality control .	-2.7240
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.0180
Approximately 17 million small red white packed chog boards to 14 grams per year distribute flight attendants to passengers before landing .	-4.8289
Swiss did not want to clarify the costs .	-2.9262
Industry insiders estimate the volume of orders according to " Northwest Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million francs - the Migros daughter achieves an annual turnover of around one billion francs .	-4.2941
But the advertising effect is more important once and for a choggi manufacturer it is a prestigious order .	-3.6672
Swiss does not want to betray how many candidates there are in the new tender .	-12.7702
However , only Swiss manufacturers are in question .	-2.3441
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey wants to try to renew the contract beyond spring 2018 .	-2.8372
For the sda the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.7828
Swiss has been distributing chocolate tables on board their flights since 2006 .	-1.8510
Before signing a contract with the Migros daughter , Barry Callebaut had delivered chocolate tablets in cooperation with Hug .	-2.5214
The opportunity to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago to start the cooperation with Chocolat Frey .	-3.9160
The airline cooperates with different Swiss chocolate producers .	-1.8002
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are treated with delicacies by the Sprüngli Confiserie , in the business class naschen passengers Schoggi of Lindt and Chocolat Frey ’ s Economy Class Schoggi .	-4.0647

Nostalgia goes into the niche " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective "	-2.5294
This repetition of history is nostalgic simultaneously because of the glorious days of characters of the 80s , for the 90-year Grunge era ( when the Vorthinker David Wain and Michael Showalter rotated the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to larger things .	-4.2417
As a cultural artifact , it is also a parody and embodiment of our facebook-capable era of permanent memories .	-2.6757
But as a franchise it feels like time is short .	-2.0146
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of its absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking cans of vegetables spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.1537
By clouding at the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they created the impossibility of winning the last part of the joke back .	-8.8981
" Ten Years Later " , with its adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted and its parody goes more according to the casting principle , including a riff on the stalker movies of the 1990s such as " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand that swings the cradle " ) .	-9.7292
At one point , an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a series of other things from 1991 " breaks a character .	-4.7997
Many of the central stories are the same .	-1.0000
The lovely coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now Roman author , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-8.0229
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still has not lost his virginity .	-1.5729
And there is another crazy malicious plot that includes Ronald Reagan ( including Mr. Showalter ) , which is now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a well-successful impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-3.8031
As always , the excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-6.7859
It is especially fun to see the eternal young Mr. Rudd , who shows Matt Dillon 's sublip bar of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on camp Andy now feels like an old cracker .	-4.7028
It is the moments of random madness that could fuel this franchise like a kind of repeated " Seven Up ! " series until he reaches what I accept as his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twenty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the bands how she will visit the film premiere of " Wet Hot American Summer " .	-4.1455
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of another kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americans " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its East and West ring struggle iconography .	-3.8392
The comedy , created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as director , indicates to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two officers from Bucharest who fight for truth , atheism and the path of Marxism Leninism .	-3.8307
Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Channing Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon-Levitt in English .	-3.6244
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.8159
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.2279
There are some nice gags to see ( the police spend time watching television chess , as Americans might do with football ) .	-3.0894
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game of ' Find the voice ' .	-11.2845
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the truth of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer wearing a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single one .	-3.3991
The comedy is not fast or frequent enough in six long .	-10.7215
" Comrade Detective " , which has been edited to a lower length , could supply his agitprop satire better , since Gregor and Iosef always visit the American message whose lobby is always occupied by two thick men who swallow a pile of Hamburg .	-4.9615
The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything a food for a coating .	-3.0030
The fictional Romanian creators were not wrong : we are even doing it with our own recent history and with that of their own .	-3.7547

Moreover , the officials secured larger quantities of marijuana and cocaine , weapons and several hundred thousand euros .	-2.6745
Two people were arrested at the same razzi in Italy .	-2.7665
German arrest warrants towards the two suspects of Italy .	-1.8295
These two will therefore probably be delivered to Germany .	-2.7012
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-1.8457
In total , more than 300 police officers were in operation .	-2.9765
Members of the mafia are accused of organised drug crime , serious violence , attempted murder and robbery and blackmail .	-2.8252
Since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor 's Office has been establishing constance against organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.5463
Between the prosecutors in Konstanz and Palermo there was a great exchange and the investigators of Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-3.7152
Therefore , the major operation was accompanied by four officials from Palermo on Wednesday morning .	-3.2880
Italian citizens , especially Italian citizens , took a close look at the Italian mafia .	-5.0485
An incident on May 27 , in Hüfingen , where several shots were fired into a restaurant early in the morning , is likely to go to the bands ' account .	-4.4965
Big Gaps in the Foreign Register	-3.0410
'Data from citizens who should not appear ' : according to a report , the foreigner register in Germany has significant shortcomings .	-3.8566
This leads to sometimes serious mistakes in asylum procedures .	-3.0363
According to a media report , the Federal Government 's Refugee Management Supervisor , Frank-Jürgen Weise , has drawn attention to large gaps in the foreign central register .	-3.7562
Shortcomings in the data registered there could lead to some serious mistakes in the case of asylum procedures and expulsions , warned in an analysis that the Southern German Newspaper has before us .	-10.5248
According to the register , ten million people with foreign nationality are collected , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-3.5376
Data are therefore managed by some 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-2.8219
Because data has not been adequately maintained , data quality has not been good in parts .	-3.5634
In individual cases , data were found in 1921 , ' from people who have long since stopped living or from citizens who have become German citizens and who should not actually appear in the register ' .	-4.5517
'Defective data input can slow back processes considerably ' , the report continues to say .	-4.5832
Moreover , the statistics on people who are travelling by exit include EU citizens who would not have to leave .	-5.7623
Such false allocations , however , led to a distorted debate on how to deal with those who are leaving , so it is stated in the analysis .	-5.7530
Meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun to return refugee families with children under 16 years of age to Italy when they have enter.	-3.7787
This is emerging from an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " New Osnabrücker Zeitung " .	-3.3785
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is conducting such procedures ' for families with children - with the exception of infants and micro-children - again to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-3.8118
Since the end of 2014 , this has been virtually impossible , so the newspaper referred to the difficult situation on the ground .	-2.9663
Under the Dublin Agreement , the EU State is responsible for refugees , who first reach .	-9.2212
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state may return it to the country of entry .	-3.4960
In the explanatory statement , the Office now writes : ' Meanwhile , the reception capacity has significantly increased for families with underage children in Italy ' .	-4.5440
Italy has given guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-2.2046
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments sufficient .	-2.2115
Other EU countries would also send refugees there under the Dublin Agreement .	-2.4122
The domestic spokesman for the left in the Bundestag , Ulla Jelpke , criticised this decision : ' Families with children threaten reception conditions and a threat to children because of the deficiencies in the Italian asylum system . '	-4.5231
Second Best Outcome	-2.1170
In total , 220 litres of people living in Oberreichenbach already provided the blood donation service to other people .	-3.4345
At least of the twelve citizens distinguished on Friday .	-2.1926
Previously Jürgen Grule , who shared 50 litres of blood with his now 100 donations .	-4.1668
Traditionally , at the meeting of the Municipal Council , the municipality recognises the multiple willingness to donate blood .	-4.3260
" It is good how our body is designed for this and we pay respect to the donors who provide their blood to strangers , nor unselfishness , " emphasized mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-5.9347
" A single donation helps several people , " explained the willingness of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , because the canned are dismantled into their components .	-4.0862
For example , three people could benefit from a donation .	-3.0794
At the same time , Maisenbacher reported about the actions carried out in Oberreichenbach in the spring .	-2.6322
" This year we achieved the second best result with 114 donors , " said the DRK circle willingness manager .	-3.2158
Obviously , the change to the Theatre House a few years ago led to higher numbers of participants .	-2.8956
Before that , Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbers were among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations .	-6.2176
Half so many born Herbert Mair and Dorothee Riexinger , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vetter delivered 10 times per 500 million from their juice .	-3.7656
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.0024
The Bank of England is expected to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged after weak economic growth and inflation weakened speculation over rising .	-3.1626
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sustainable " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of increasing pressure .	-3.1607
The Bank ’ s policymakers , with 6 to 2 , voted to keep interest rates at 0.25 % , with fewer members aspiring to rise this month , as weak economic growth has weakened support for increased .	-4.0696
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % in 2017 and 1.6 % in 2018 , warning that pressure on household incomes would continue , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-2.9499
But it signaled that rate hikes would be needed in the next few years to rein in inflation fueled by Brexit , and she said that borrowing costs might have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-11.1308
Members also voted to withdraw some of the Mammut Recovery Package issued a year ago after Brexit .	-2.7147
It will demand time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper funding to banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - GBP 115 billion .	-3.9915
Minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : ' In the MPC ’ s central forecast , gross domestic product ( GDP ) remains weak in the short term , as pressure on household real incomes continues to burden consumption ' .	-3.9554
As regards interest rates , it repeated that ' a certain tightening of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' slightly larger ' scale than markets expect .	-3.5521
Markets are currently predicting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.0829
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be ' gradually ' and ' limited ' .	-2.5539
The Bank ’ s downward growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % and 1.7 % forecast in May .	-2.7282
It retained its growth forecast at 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.6938
The pound fell after these news against the dollar and the euro .	-2.0140
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-1.7995
The decision will not change once the recent disappointing growth figures have dampened rising expectations for an increase in interest rates , and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the second quarter from 0.3 % in the previous three months to 0.3 .	-4.6646
Growth is expected to be 0.3 % in the third quarter , although it will recover slightly after the bank at the end of the year .	-3.0955
The latest inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and minor salary increases , as the tightening will be even worse before it improves .	-4.1205
She added that monetary policy cannot " prevent " income decline in the next few years , but she added that wages will " recover " markedly " at the end of their three-year predictions .	-4.3735
The economy is also strengthened by increasing demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate some of the lower consumer spending .	-3.1745
The decision comes one year after the reduction in interest rates to 0.25 % last August , after the shocking EU vote that caused the pound ’ s decline .	-3.4388
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years to fully achieve prices and the economy .	-2.5828
Before the Bank ’ s last judgment on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates rose , as inflation increased the pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers calling for an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-9.3377
Last month , inflation fell from 2.9 % in June to 2.6 % , although the Bank said that this was expected and would return to it in the coming months .	-3.6266
The Bank said that exceeding its target of 2 % is " totally " attributing to the weak pound .	-3.4833
Andrew Montlake , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders seek out loudly for business and want to end the year positively .	-4.4330
The market looks especially good for those who expire the existing deals and complete the new mortgages , and many with toll-free options and low rates are becoming increasingly popular . '	-4.1395
NHS ( National Health Service ) is meant to prescribe 10,000 disputed HIV drugs .	-2.5288
Patients will have access to transformative HIV prevention treatment as of September , following a struggle before the High Court against the financing of the drug in NH. p, , and , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.2146
NHS England announced that a pre-exposure prophylax ( PrEP ) taken before sexual intercourse , which can reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now supplied by the health service through a first three-year study for estimated 10,000 people .	-4.2168
He agreed to finance the process after the Court of Appeal confirmed last year a Supreme Court ruling that the NHS had the power to pay for PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-3.6665
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England Chief Simon Stevens as " important new intervention " , while the National Aids Trust ( NAT ) called this " crucial moment " .	-3.5340
Sexual Health Clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .	-6.4821
Pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV preparations taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-2.7339
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission for infectious persons .	-2.7269
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are enough drugs in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-3.4566
Such medicines can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-2.9304
Those who are called into question for treatment include gay or bisexual men , transsexuals and persons with HIV positive partners who have not been treated successfully .	-3.3186
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree to the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals with a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.0425
People who live in England and are registered with a house doctor can also register for possible participation in their local sexual clinic . , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.4712
The program will sign a contract to deliver medicines this week after an international competitive procurement .	-2.8992
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as targeted , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.0135
Stevens said : " This great new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.6683
It is another milestone in the more than three decades of progress in addressing one of the greatest health challenges facing mankind . '	-3.4314
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a decisive moment in the fight against HIV .	-1.9621
PrEP , if targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-8.1847
From September , people with high risks of HIV will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and is not subject to negotiations with a partner , leading to the improvement of many , many lives .	-4.0884
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.4575
Ian Green , Chairman of the Terrence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority must now be that the study is carried out quickly throughout the country and that nobody with a risk to HIV is left behind .	-3.3519
Now that PrEP test medicine has been purchased , we are on the best way to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-3.1640
Sharon Hodgson , Sharon Health Minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and reluctant government implementation .	-2.7186
The evidence shows how transformatively this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention , and how this life-changing infection can be transmitted .	-3.3755
This attempt brings us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-1.8821
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible throughout the country in order to protect people who are infected with HIV , and that it will help bring us a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society . '	-4.2930
Living the Great Life : Intermediate floor and clever designer tricks have turned these small Earls Court apartment into a generous home .	-4.3694
Joanne Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , reduced in 2014 from a large house in Knightsbridge to an earls court apartment .	-2.5961
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-3.5978
" Before that I lived with my ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room , " says Joanne .	-1.8173
" I was looking for something that was comparable to my price .	-1.7377
This apartment was shown to me in Earls Court and she had the same high ceilings .	-2.3931
I fallen in love with her and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.4506
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet of the apartment has been completely overtaken .	-3.1170
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - you had to go through the kitchen to get into the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and an intermediate floor to make the best use of the generous ceiling height .	-12.0687
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.3524
That was my request , ' she says .	-1.5504
For this purpose she commissioned the architecture and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place to live for Joanne .	-4.1839
The ceiling was not large enough to place two rooms together , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate floor in which one could face .	-3.7163
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-2.3376
" The steel mill is rather complicated " , he explains .	-2.3362
" We had to arrange the rooms so that they were stacked together without us having to go back .	-3.4545
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel in such a way that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-3.9265
This arrangement allowed Erfan to place two rooms in full each other - with much additional drama .	-3.5981
For the middle floor a classic copper light window from Retrouvius down the glamorous living area .	-3.7840
Mirrored gold furniture , silver accents and vintage serge mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-2.0765
Using mirrors plays a role in adding theater , space and light .	-1.9907
At both end , a short corridor is mirrored to allow it to work longer .	-3.0233
In the kitchen , mirroring feels like a window in another room .	-2.5229
At the entrance , mirrored units offer space for all Joanne cutlers and glasses .	-3.2643
By perceiving a more glamorous space , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen unless it is used .	-8.1257
Foldable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.9805
The special thing about this is that it is a garage door .	-2.2244
" A little engineering art went in there , " explains Erfan from the steel reinforced , veneered MDF door .	-3.2099
'It is weight , so it slides very lightly when you push the door . '	-3.7143
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage , Joanne could win an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.3645
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or as your property is appreciated , " says Erfan .	-2.8369
" In a rudimentary form a property broker will occur and calculate based on the size of the ground " .	-3.7563
They have managed to increase the floor space while using high-quality materials that give the room its luxurious advantage .	-4.6585
" The materials are the things you touch and which thus help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.3080
" You don 't love yourself in the electric power outlets in the walls . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.8033
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-1.4637
It shows that an apartment can turn through good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing .	-3.6183
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.5444
Brothers Fight for a USD 500 million Empire	-1.8131
Two brothers are four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , in a discussion about one of Victoria ’ s largest real estate empires worth more than $ 500 million .	-3.3155
Former Director of the Carlton Football Club and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , only three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how to share their property and business . , , , and , , , , , the , , , , , , , , , and , , and , , , , , , , , , and , and , , .	-16.0100
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute over the separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.2465
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers own 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a shop in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-2.6200
The Westco Jeans family founded there and grew into a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.1145
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.4246
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now includes offices in the city center , the development areas of Brunswick and Sorrento , apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller , and shopping centres in the suburban area .	-6.8688
According to an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as the " main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of corporate wealth and Paul about .	-3.6068
A court act says that this means that Colin ownership worth $ 316 million and Paul worth $ 176 million .	-2.9406
The division of real estate and cash has proved to be a problem for Paul .	-2.0910
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought were the best objects , " he wrote in a first affidavit in 2015 .	-2.9719
Last Friday , after several failed mediations , the first hearing of the Supreme Court took place .	-2.0394
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin , as Paul claims , excluded him .	-3.3532
Colin argues that this is not true , but accuses Paul of managing some possessions incompetently .	-2.4000
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says that he hopes to resolve the dispute .	-2.5169
" My Italian heritage stipulates that the family is the main priority , " he wrote .	-2.4939
The costs are rising in this case , with hundreds of pages with affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both parties .	-7.8194
Mrs De Lutis and her late husband , Luigi , were Italian immigrants who operated milkbars and delicacies from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.2888
They used security to buy the collingwood property where Colin opened the first family jeans shop .	-4.1163
Colin says that he started Westco when he was " the high school in my last years when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-9.5383
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass their property on frankly to their sons .	-2.4046
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end in court , " she wrote .	-2.3280
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis Group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million during leaving the company and Luke $ 26 million .	-3.3375
Both Lukas and Mark were , says Paul ' has become bitter about the conditions of their financial separation ' .	-3.3977
Colin was very restrained , despite being a former AFL board member and , after a biography of Eddie McGuire in 2015 , he was the best friend of the TV star .	-4.3837
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-1.1143
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I really can not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.6506
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul has decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts , " he wrote .	-2.5898
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote to the court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.2019
" Our father would not have wanted Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hoped for a solution " .	-3.1408
On Friday , that hope seemed to be over .	-1.7094
" Our matter will be resolved by the courts in the near future , " wrote Colin .	-2.4230
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the presidential media abstinence .	-1.9754
Others tried it and failed .	-1.5976
Perhaps John F. Kelly can actually do so .	-2.4292
If so , he will be the first .	-0.7989
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including the reports of the news media , in the hope of keeping the boss on a more uniform course .	-3.8441
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.4375
" When John F. Kelly , the new White House chief of staff met senior officials on his first working day , he was a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House , which he wanted to repair : bad information that falls into the hands of the president .	-3.9574
Kelly told staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had good information . '	-3.9574
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-7.4092
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , his television advertising is still strong .	-2.5064
" When Trump was annoyed for an unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair reporting of jobs to be convinced , " said former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg to politico in February .	-7.6999
Politicos Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , according to six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media consumption includes constant praise . "	-3.3153
Okay .	-0.4257
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit was ever “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-1.6937
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know to others - that without their interventions , Trump ’ s tweets would have contained even more fuel .	-3.0290
We will probably never know anything about the tweets Trump has not sent .	-2.4987
If his staff managed to keep him out of trouble several times , then their efforts have been worthwhile .	-4.2023
But no one has consistently prevented Trump from causing controversy .	-2.0691
Part of the problem is that people in a White House composed of competing parties are constantly trying to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump material that may promote their views from the world .	-3.4237
Politico - dealing with this history as a whole - reported in May on the desire of the advisers to provide the President with dubious information for strategic reasons .	-9.1523
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.4778
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press sections , especially those with damaging leaks , and that he is stepping up to find out where they come from .	-4.3638
That is exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone accused the president of being a printed copy of an article by GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of being " the source behind a pile of lecks " in the White House .	-4.6485
Although Johnson was permanently banned from Twitter due to harassment , or that he did not offer any concrete evidence , or that he made mistaken accusations and revoked them in the past .	-4.2166
Trump read the article and began to interview employees about Walsh . '	-2.4387
Goldmakers added that the then Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and the White House Secretary-General , Rob Porter , ' tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper scale that Trump receives . '	-9.3460
How did this work ?	-1.3205
Kelly tried to do the same three months later .	-1.8317
Perhaps he will prove himself to be a more effective manager as a priebus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-3.1261
These unchanging factors make Kelly ’ s mission very difficult .	-1.9380
Master-Searched criminals receive post from Europol	-3.0250
Since the address is unknown , the people are asked and hoped for .	-9.2182
This summer , virtual postcards will be sent to dangerous criminals throughout Europe .	-3.3296
Since the addresses of the heavy criminals sought are of course not known , evidence from the population is hoped for and requested .	-4.5434
Europol reported on Friday the action following the " EU Most Wanted " advent calendar of winter .	-2.8051
Experience showed that many volatile destinations were hiding , it was said by Europol .	-4.0551
We have compiled 21 postcards for sought-after criminals from 21 EU countries .	-2.9000
Since 2016 there is the website www.eumostwanted , more than 2.5 million times it has been vie.	-3.3154
36 of the online requests have been arrested so far , at least 11 of them because of references to the publication on the website .	-3.5641
Travellers negotiate a digging and return to the Millionaire Series .	-2.7212
Some of the wealthiest homeowners of the West Midlands are once again at war with some determined travellers who negotiated a tomb drawn from the community to demand a field back in front of their manor houses .	-5.4338
Travellers have parked their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy street of Solihull called the " millionaire series " .	-3.7465
They brought horses , babies , and an army of transporters after they were only thrown out in May , without being deterred by a divide excavated by the Council to prevent their incidents .	-5.9221
The tactful group found a gap in the defence plants and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhandicapped to find a way .	-7.0129
Angry inhabitants have afflicted the Solihull Council , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-3.7881
One anonymous inhabitant said : " They moved there on Monday evening after they were sent by Bentley Heath , where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-8.5827
The Council must be forced into action by shame to implement it , because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-3.3824
The travellers were there in May , were moved further and are now back .	-3.7355
More arrived last night , probably more today . '	-1.7649
She added : ' The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with this by giving long instructions to protect their parks .	-3.0385
I live on Streetsbrook Road and I am not happy to continue to pay my local tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.5808
A resident who did not want to be named said : " It is ridiculous that we have just seen the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-3.6179
The figures have increased this time and have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.0758
A spokesman from the Council of Solihull said : ' We are aware of an unauthorised camp in the country beyond Streetsbrook Road and work with the Solihull police , taking the necessary legal steps to move forward as quickly as possible .	-4.8538
In order to support our collection of proof , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour to the police by calling 101 .	-3.1678
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we are presenting our case . '	-3.5036
From Birkenhof , Waldhotel Luise	-1.6089
From the former Hotel Birkenhof , the Waldhotel Luise will be .	-2.3321
The house in front of the gates of Freudenstadts is currently being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-3.8297
That is good news for the city .	-1.3052
Because , with the closure of Hotel Birkenhof by the then Ambiente Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , around 30 000 nights were lost per year and also revenue by the tourist tax .	-4.5031
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically increasing numbers of refugees coming to the county , the hotel building was offered to the Land Council as collection accommodation , creating controversial discussions .	-4.6878
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by establishing a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-3.5976
The decision was not uncontroversial in the local council at that time .	-5.5242
But , above all , Freudenstadt ’ s mayor Julian Osswald defended the hotel ’ s location and spoke of serious interested parties at the time .	-5.0246
He should be right .	-0.9909
The Group Luisenhotels with Managing Director Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , has acquired the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the three-star plus category under the name Waldhotel Luise .	-4.3280
The group has four houses with the Freudenstadt object .	-2.5042
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-1.1986
You are called Hotel Luise , Luisenpark , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.7599
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house , it becomes clear what extensive renovation work is being carried out .	-4.9108
The soils were extracted , ceilings were partially dismantled , old bathtubs removed from the rooms .	-3.5361
The entire hotel is a single building site .	-1.6969
There is still a great deal to be done by March .	-2.4192
" It is actually a nice hotel , " says Thomas Scherer in conversation with our newspaper .	-2.6930
Everything is to be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-8.7168
The rooms are equipped with large showers , the entrance area is transformed and new windows are installed .	-4.2769
Everything should be " nice close to the citizens " , as Thomas Scherer says .	-4.2104
'We want to make a jewelry out . '	-1.5726
Swimming pool , spa area and meeting room are all equipped .	-9.8201
Scherer does not want to be positioned at the high level of hotels in Lauterbad , but at a high level inside the city .	-4.5381
The Waldhotel Luise with its approximately 60 rooms wants to sit up wide , explains Scherer further .	-3.8534
Both individual holidaymakers , groups and businessmen should feel at home in the hotel .	-3.4387
He has already held talks with OB Julian Oswald and Director of Tourism Michael Krause , says Scherer .	-9.2493
The city 's ideas are similar to those of the Hotel Group .	-3.4926
'We are on the same line . '	-0.9355
Thomas Scherer does not want to determine exactly the amount of investment required .	-9.0619
Just under one million euros , he expects .	-2.7540
The exterior installations are also being put on the front , which is already evident .	-4.4278
A large terrace is created in an inner courtyard , which will be accessible by the restaurant , which is public .	-3.7568
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.6484
Russia ’ s Special Affairs : US Special Investigators Uses Grand Jury	-3.1568
In the Russian affair surrounding US President Donald Trump , special mediator Robert Mueller is said to have set up a Grand Jury after a report .	-3.7350
The body has started work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " , invoking those familiar with the matter .	-5.0310
The newspaper considered the step as a sign that Mueller had expanded and intensified his investigations .	-2.8846
The CNN channel reported that there have already been initial submissions by the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-10.6921
US intelligence agencies have long accused the Kremlin of being targeted in the 2016 presidential campaign .	-2.9899
Mueller examines whether there were agreements between Trump ’ s campaign team and Moscow .	-1.8640
The focus of the investigation is on several men who acted in the election campaign as consultants of the Republican .	-3.6027
Mueller reportedly looked at more and more Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-2.2490
The ' Washington Post ' wrote a few weeks ago that the special investigator put Trump personally in the centre and examine the accusation of whether the president might have hindered the judiciary in the course of the affair . a few .	-8.5554
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine evidence in possible cases of crime and to decide whether to charge .	-3.3273
Grand Jurys are therefore also called charges .	-2.5671
They are usually intervened when they are larger and controversial cases .	-3.4171
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-2.0569
The body can also be turned on by the Public Prosecutor to submit persons for hearing under oath .	-3.8050
According to the CNN channel , subpoenas have already been issued to revolve around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.3251
People involved in the meeting had been asked to make a statement , as stated in the report .	-3.5013
They should also provide documents .	-1.0442
In addition to Trump Jr. , Trump ’ s consultant and son of silence , Jared Kushner , and his then campaign chairman , Paul Manafort , were present at the discussion .	-4.0513
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on television that the appointment showed that Mueller did not let his work intimidate and that , if necessary , he wanted to act quickly .	-3.9631
But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on charges .	-3.5487
Nevertheless , the establishment of the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigations and a new cause for concern for President Trump .	-8.0813
In the midst of the new revelations , on Thursday evening , the president used a speech in West Virginia to present the Russian affair as a campaign for his political opponents .	-2.7241
" Russia 's history is a total invention , " Trump said .	-1.7434
The issue gives the Democrats an opportunity to ' feel good because they have nothing else to talk about ' .	-3.2005
His special advisor , Ty Cobb , explained in an opinion that he knows nothing about setting up a Grand Jury .	-2.9630
But he usually works in secret , he emphasized .	-2.4121
The White House is in favour of any measures that speeded up the work of the special investigator in a ' fair ' way .	-3.5058
Former FBI leader James Comey said three times that the president was not investigated .	-2.8840
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , as stated in the statement .	-3.5796
Mueller was only used after Trump Comey fired .	-2.2581
Because of this throw , accusations against Trump had been voiced that he wanted to hinder justice .	-5.2077
Comey said before a Senate Committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser Michael Flynn .	-2.7097
The President is under great pressure because of the investigation .	-1.9958
After representing US media , the White House collected material against the special investigator and his staff .	-3.0559
The speculation triggered whether Trump wants to dismiss Mueller .	-2.4801
Unlike an independent Congressional special investigator , such as the Watergate affair for President Richard Nixon , who resigned later , Mueller has a position in which he could theoretically be fired by the Ministry of Justice at pressure from the president .	-3.9424
But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-2.3509
Two groups of Republican and Democratic senators presented legislation on Thursday that the Special Investigator could no longer be so easily dismissed .	-7.6188
Antarctica ’ s Gigantian Iceberg Drives Antarctica	-2.1077
In West Antarctica , a huge iceberg separated from the nearly seven times Berlin from the Schelfeis .	-4.9935
The Bremerhaven Alfred Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research announced this on Wednesday .	-2.5867
Over a trillion tonnes of heavy and 5800 square kilometres of coloss are now driving north and will probably take two or three years to melt .	-5.1864
It is one of the largest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades , with 175 kilometres of length and a width of up up to 50 k.	-4.3877
He does not pose a danger to humans .	-2.4695
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking down the iceberg is unclear , according to research .	-3.1584
Overall , however , there has been a series of unusual collapses in the region for around 30 years , writing in a fact background the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) .	-4.5455
Many researchers believe that this could be linked to global warming .	-2.3382
The now aborted coloss has been part of the Larsen C-Schelfeis .	-4.5729
Schelfeis swims on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-2.5431
It therefore continues to grow into the sea and regularly breaks down .	-3.0193
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the top of the Antarctic peninsula .	-2.8979
North of this shelf ice ice disrupted the balance of growth and abortion a few years ago .	-3.7925
AWI researcher Daniela Jansen wrote a complete ice cream .	-3.8275
There is much to suggest that the Larsen C shelf ice is in danger , because the front edge has never retracted as far as it is at present .	-5.6931
In addition , the ice plate stands under excitement and can fall apart if a piece is cancelled at a key point .	-5.8824
Melting Schelfeis and Iceberg does not increase sea level , as it swims on the water and displaces ice as much water as it results after melting itself .	-3.9672
However , the loss of the shelf ice cream means that the glaciers can flow directly into the sea and flow far faster than before .	-5.1432
This could possibly increase the sea level , but only to a small extent , writes the British research project to observe Antarctica ( Midas ) .	-8.4911
According to AWI , the Larsen C Schelfeis is the fourth largest shelf ice ice in Antarctica , with almost 50 000 square kilometres .	-4.9977
At the mainland transition it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-3.0476
They regularly break off there .	-3.0678
" Although it is a natural event and we do not know of any direct link to climate change , the ice shield is now in a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Leary of the British Swansea University .	-4.7108
" This is the longest withdrawal since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.8432
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen-C shelf ice will grow again or will go back in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague , Adrian Luckman , added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.4189
But this development will take decades .	-1.4973
Although these researchers do not attribute to climate change , many ice shelves of the Antarctic Peninsula have fallen apart in recent decades .	-3.7957
This long peak of Antarctica extends towards South America .	-1.9150
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey research programme , the ice area of the Antarctic Peninsula has declined by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950 ’ s .	-3.1729
The temperature rise has contributed to the decline .	-2.3898
The Antarctic Peninsula has warmed about three degrees over the past 50 years , thus being one of the areas where the temperature rises fastest .	-3.8301
CDU wants household rates for . . and . . . . . . . . . .	-11.8994
Because it is becoming increasingly difficult to occupy jobs that become freelancers , the CDU calls for the employers ' association to leave in order to become more attractive .	-5.0395
Just before the summer break , the circle picked up 41 new posts in the administration .	-3.9232
More than 1100 employees and officials work for the circle administration in Mettmann .	-2.1801
Now 17 trainees have again behind their first working day .	-3.5506
The lessons at the circle are obviously very sought .	-3.6521
Approximately 620 applications were listed for the places to be issued this year .	-3.4633
However , the circle still lacks staff to meet the increased demands and tasks .	-3.4507
Currently , there are still 50 unoccupied jobs in the Mettmann district .	-3.3714
Among other things , doctors and engineers are sought as well as forces of general administration .	-3.7792
The CDU , together with the FDP and the UEC , wants to take the initiative in the circle and face the administrative shortage of experts .	-4.8642
According to the request of the parties , the administration is to develop a concept of recruitment and human resources development .	-11.7679
The aim is not only to meet the short-term needs of skilled workers , but also to counteract the shortage of candidates in the future .	-4.2054
The overall concept should be oriented internally and externally , should demonstrate concrete measures for cross-entry-level entrants and include a training offensive , demand CDU , FDP and UWG .	-9.5868
This sounds like a good approach .	-11.4553
Because the circle has to do with staffing problems that were not known before .	-4.0461
Other cities advertise good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-1.6933
There is talk of a genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-2.7778
There is also a large number of employees who retire from the service due to illness or age .	-3.6878
So it is high time to act so that there are no more jobs left unoccupied .	-4.2181
But Klaus-Dieter Völker , the leader of the CDU , goes beyond the joint motion with his party .	-3.0591
He recently caused a fist-thick surprise in the circle when he publicly questioned staff coverage and stunned the rest of the parties .	-5.0942
Peoples want to see every opportunity to leave the municipal employers ' association .	-4.1536
" If we do not reach a satisfactory solution here in the short term , circle administration with trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with circle cities - should seek a household tariff , " says peoples .	-4.7119
Thus , the CDU is trying to pay better for employees and officials than is actually providing for the public service tariff .	-4.5148
The salaries are currently precisely required , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level oriented towards professional years .	-4.9536
But the circle ’ s tasks have increased in recent years .	-2.5997
Only a few weeks ago , new spaces had to be established to deal with the provisions of the new prostitute protection law .	-4.0890
Landrat Thomas Hendele and Director Martin Judge have a problem not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers : they have too few staff .	-3.3847
Making Italy ’ s Soon for NGO to .	-7.9987
Italy has warned NGOs who use bailouts for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue unless they comply with new rules for their operations .	-3.3654
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue to work , " said Interior Minister Marco Minniti in an interview with the Turin newspaper La Stampa .	-3.3862
Minniti 's warning came a day after the Italian authorities seized a boat from the German Youth Rescue Organization , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-3.7325
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations by the Italian Public Prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-3.0532
" For us , saving human life remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot currently operate in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-3.4439
'We can only judge any allegations currently made after we have collected all the information and assess the situation . '	-3.4714
The Italian authorities had monitored the boat of Youth Rescue , the Iuventa , since October .	-2.7583
It is suspected that his crew is taking hose boat migrants on board who are delivered directly by human traffickers and that smugglers can leave for the ships to be used again .	-5.0762
At least one such meeting was allegedly held only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the Public Prosecutor 's Act , whose content was published by Italian media .	-7.6729
The occupation is suspected of disregarding the authority of the Italian coastguard , which monitors rescue operations in the area for humanitarian reasons , not for any other motives .	-3.3810
Under the code of conduct , boats such as Iuventa must above all have an Italian police officer who supervises their activities .	-3.0228
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.2582
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be regarded as unnecessary , but acceptable , as they would not entail ' major changes or disabilities ' of their rescue operations .	-3.6631
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is doctors without borders ( MSF ) .	-2.1604
Miniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the rescue measures in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , suggesting that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coastguard and cooperate with local mayors have borne fruit .	-3.7449
" In recent days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " said the minister .	-2.3364
He announced plans for further discussions with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives , and with Chad , Niger and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants who leave these countries in the hope of achieving Europe .	-6.5312
Grows and Trials	-2.1924
Nine Weilermer Biker , the " Berlin Outposts " and two host riders met in Wachenheim in the North Palace to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-3.6868
Three friendly guides were available for this .	-1.9641
Accommodation in the Wachenheim Valley proved to be a good starting point for tours . of , , , and . , , , , , , , of , and . , , ,	-7.1034
The Wachenheim Castle and Wine Festival was a welcome extra .	-1.8227
The first tour led along the vineyards to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures .	-2.2278
The following panoramic viewpoints followed , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the palatinate forest and the upstream plains .	-6.6865
Meanwhile , longer and longer trials were rewarded .	-3.7881
On the second day , Bad Dürkheim went to the saline and the Volksfest sausage market .	-8.3212
Again , viewpoint ran at the point of view , connected by " flowing " trials and moderate increases .	-4.4504
On the last two days many metres of altitude were scheduled .	-3.3203
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and refuges brought welcome breaks .	-1.9961
In Bad Dürkheim , the bikers breathed a healing sole in the open-air inhalatorium .	-3.3085
New Town has also been targeted .	-2.8459
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Palatinate Forest from its best side - sporting and cultural .	-3.7635
Konsole instead of Rasen - Bundesliga equips for e-sport	-2.3598
Do the sports stars seat off computer consoles instead of fighting through the stadium races in wind and weather ?	-4.9493
The fact is : E-Sport has long become a serious industry , a lucrative business - large stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high gagens .	-13.9463
The first German League Associations have also recognized this , which are increasingly committed in this area .	-6.7264
The beginning of 2015 was VfL Wolfsburg , later followed by FC Schalke 04 and last but not least the VfB Stuttgart , which established an e-sport department in mid-July and took two professionals for the FIFA 17 computer game under contract .	-4.3357
" We hope to inspire new young target groups for the VfB , " says Managing Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-8.8018
He is sure that several clubs climb this train .	-3.2660
Next weekend , the FIFA World Football Association in London organizes the first " Interactive Club World Cup " to compete with the gamers of various clubs .	-4.2010
Besides Schalke and Wolfsburg , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or the PSV Eindhoven have qualified .	-8.8069
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sport .	-1.6723
The ex-trainer of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.2688
" The real football has to deal with the 14 to 30 years in particular that young people will continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52-year-old .	-11.8595
And : The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-2.6818
With prominent e-sportsmen under contract , one could be far more present online in these markets than just once a year to send the Federal League to Asia .	-4.4803
What exactly is this all about ?	-0.8086
In e-sport , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counterstrike " or even the FIFA football simulation are championed at competitive level .	-3.9808
Long ago , as in normal sport , leagues have established themselves in which professionals compete .	-10.8006
And in Asia ’ s 2022 games , e-sport is already part of the official program .	-2.2934
But is it a real sport at all ?	-2.2997
For many , the idea is certainly usual .	-3.7332
Ingo Frobösse has long worked on this issue .	-9.1840
For the professor at the Deutsche Sportthochschule in Cologne , e-Sport is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-4.1969
It also requires cognitive skills , technical and tactical understanding and rapid response capability .	-3.1135
Professional gamers should train not only on the console but also their bodies and pay attention to nutrition .	-2.9150
" The fit player is a good player . "	-1.8799
Frobösse also sees problems : " Doping is becoming more and more a topic " .	-3.5937
Controls were hard to practice in online games , and the structures of classic sport lacked in the scene .	-4.1737
The scientist positively highlights the high inclusive effect of e-sport .	-2.9168
Players travel internationally , this is like a large global family , and there are no intercultural barriers .	-3.2389
A study by Deloitte and the Federal Association of Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth for e-Sport .	-3.1386
In 2016 , EUR 50 million had been implemented in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsoring and large tournaments .	-2.8514
In three years sales will be 130 million .	-2.7139
That is little against the nearly EUR 2.4 billion in football league .	-3.7894
However , e-sport is not far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey , " writes the Deloitte consultants .	-9.4951
Many countries have continued to be internationally .	-2.8316
Large markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and baseball star Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.5769
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-betting provider Unikrn .	-2.1528
There is also a great deal to be done in Europe .	-2.6395
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a subject of teaching , says Frobösse .	-3.3455
In the Netherlands and France , according to Dutt , the Football First League Associations are now obliged to set up an e-sport department .	-3.6610
" In European comparison , Germany lags behind " , explains VfB-Board Röttgermann .	-2.9653
It is no longer enough to fall into nostalgia and clarify the old times .	-3.7900
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to organise the company in the modern market .	-3.6482

Michelle Carter condemned for the texts pushing Conrad Roy to suicide	-2.2651
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years because she encouraged her friend by texts and calls to suicide .	-2.9056
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been suspended on prob.	-3.5109
Carter was sentenced in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who took his life on 13 July 2014 .	-2.6798
The father of Roy said at the hearing on Thursday : " My family is uncomfortable .	-2.2778
My son was my best friend . '	-0.7846
Carter was allowed to remain free until vocation .	-2.2217
She was faced with a maximum penalty of 20 years , but her legal representatives argued that both her and Mr Roy suffered mental illness .	-2.8683
Carter dressed in red trousers and a cream-coloured blouse , stood in the eye with tears , with folded hands and downwards eyes when sentenced .	-3.7007
" Their actions have killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutor said to the court .	-2.9727
" She finished his life to make her own better .	-2.5585
She took no responsibility , " she said .	-1.7193
'It has not shown any repentance ' .	-6.7990
But Carter 's lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance that they regret entirely ' .	-4.1585
Judge Lawrence Moniz said , however , that he did not find out that her ' age or maturity , or even her mental illness , have a significant impact on their actions ' .	-4.0049
A Public Prosecutor read a statement by Roy ’ s mother , Lynn Roy , saying that there is no day when I do not mourn the loss of my beloved son .	-4.5612
I want him to be proud of me and how I deal with everything ; despite all the pain that we will carry with us to be there for his sisters ' , it says .	-4.8868
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said she was " followed " by the knowledge that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be an aunt for his children .	-3.5734
" No longer have this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain that I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.2510
This case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to call on another to commit suicide .	-3.0191
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 by a carbon monoxide poisoning in one vehicle .	-2.0966
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s text messages revealed that she had encouraged him to end his life.	-3.4542
" Standing up , jumping from a building , fire yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-4.7525
In the moments before his suicide she wrote : " You must do Conrad " and " All you have to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy . "	-3.2287
Judge Moniz said that Carter was looking for attention by the death of Roy and ordered that she should benefit from the case through any press .	-3.1691
The case has shared the legal opinion .	-1.9606
Amanda Knox , who was sentenced in 2007 for murder of her British fellow citizen in Italy before being released two years ago , was among the few who defended the carter .	-4.0407
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in the Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not prison . '	-2.3270
Joshua Kimmich : Learning from the New Mini Lahm of the FC Bayern	-2.7342
The fact that Joshua Kimmich was allowed to run up as a captain at the Audi Cup is no accident .	-2.9879
The FC Bayern trusts the Confed Cup winner a large season - extra motivation does not harm it .	-3.5893
Something else was different in his place in the cabin , which Joshua Kimmich immediately saw , even though the additional piece of clothing was very , very small .	-4.1833
But since far and wide on the second day of the Audi Cup , of course , no Philipp Lahm and no Manuel Neuer was seen , he stopped the bind allocated to him .	-4.5441
" The trainer did not announce it " , the Confed Cup winner later told him that after his first deployment as a Bavarian captain .	-4.4608
Good , objection could have been better than 0.2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.5175
But the sign of the coach Kimmich could interpret as well .	-2.6176
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a guide in the C-Elf professionals from youth players , debuters and specifically from holiday , but he .	-11.3176
Sugar is best distributed among those who are confident that you want to keep a mood .	-6.0855
Those who choose to take the legacy of lahm can only use a small extra motivation .	-4.2076
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want to take on responsibility as a player " .	-3.2203
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flied over the field as a mini-lahm .	-3.3324
Right behind , that is now his position , the white binding on the arm did the rest .	-3.9113
And Kimmich acted in this start formation like the one who can best take the ruder in hand .	-5.3006
He gave instructions , tried to steer the unplayed force .	-2.7870
He had a glance for the whole , while many others were busy with themselves .	-8.5036
Vidal with overplaying his missing fitness ( barely working ) ; Renato Sanches comes to the devil coming from the services of the Asian journey ( even folded only conditionally ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle thus not found negative in their first appearance in the Bavarian tricot .	-7.5410
After all , that worked very well .	-2.4314
Süle ran beside Kimmich , Rudy before the defense , both acted sovereign .	-2.4607
The well-known Napoli storm was often difficult , and Süle also tried to succeed in playing a few times .	-5.2339
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admitted that the result was ' not the way we hoped for it ' .	-3.5811
But he , too , showed a proper achievement in the debut .	-3.0335
Relocation , tempo change : " For this style I was obtained " .	-3.8586
As unusual this Bavarian world is for the latest updates , you saw after the game .	-4.6251
Rudy , for example , did not give one or two in the catacombs , but certainly six or seven interviews .	-2.5755
Kimmich adopted a few critical statements in the back of his new players .	-4.8246
He heard an interesting phrase from Süle : " What is going on here I have already noticed .	-3.8610
You simply have to win every game at Bavaria .	-2.7247
After all , it no longer needs to teach the new .	-2.0795

Austria ’ s best known footballer has reported on Twitter just before the game and wished the <unk>FB ladies all the best .	-5.0792
The Bavarian Legionaire is a virtual club colleague of <unk>FB-Captain Schnaderbeck and fevers with our Ladys .	-5.0297

Companies satisfied with Rheinland-Palatine Minister : Economy praises Wissing ’ s Pace	-3.5799
It was often unconciliatory , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Green ) was still the Minister of Economy of Rhineland-Palatinate .	-7.7138
This is revealed after more than a year when the new Minister for Economic Affairs is in office , Volker , and F. .	-8.4893
Chambers and businesses from the region speak on T V question about a change in economic policy - and at the same time rebuke the old minister .	-4.1284
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trier Enterprises ( VTU ) , says : " Knowing the wishes of the economy that Lemke has all blocked " .	-3.4910
The biggest U-turn sees Natus in infrastructure policy : the gap in motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s priorities list .	-11.1905
Even this year , the Ministry hopes for a planning statement procedure , and construction law will be in place by 2021 .	-5.4290
A role in the country ’ s plans also plays the Western bypass of Trier , which is at the forefront of the German transport plan .	-13.8406
The aim is to start the route in December 2020 , says Ministry Speaker Cornelia Holtmann .	-2.9467
Natus sees it as a sign to support regional but internationally competing companies .	-3.1678
As suggested by Wissing , the Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier seeks a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been descending for ten years .	-4.9982
Moreover , knowledge has an open ear for people who want to create their own company , the IHK praises .	-13.7682
The Trier Craft Chamber sees in the new master bonus an additional incentive for young trainees , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-3.2446
A premium of EUR 1000 is planned for the existing championship test and EUR 2500 if graduates are self-employed within ten years of master training .	-4.7517
But the country ’ s homework list remains long .	-1.8054
The planned road construction is quick to create facts , while the country lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , IHK Trier ’ s managing director .	-5.0659
Of 56 new engineers wishing to stop knowledge of national operations , only 29 jobs have been filled .	-4.6016
The IHK calls for more orders to be made to external offices .	-2.8204
CDU group vice Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that 2017 and 2018 invest more than EUR 20 million less in maintaining national roads than proposed .	-3.4291
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to address the region ’ s shortage of skilled workers .	-3.6608
It is also sobering that there has been broadband expansion in the country .	-3.9589
In 2016 , regional companies had only valued network supply in an IHK survey with the note 3.4 .	-3.1928
They complained about stalled Internet connections and disruptions .	-2.5565
Ex-Minister of Economics Eveline Lemke is currently out of politics and is still in the Pro Wind Wind Supervisory Board .	-3.4881
The Green Group left Lemke until April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months of disagreement , she has already cleared up the field .	-4.2085
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel vehicles - car manufacturers face a backlash	-2.5562
One day before Audi announced , BMW said that it would offer to update the software in more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.1648
The BMW Chairman said that the company believed that ' there are more intelligent options than driving restrictions ' , referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel vehicles .	-3.8918
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe modifying to reduce their diesel emissions .	-7.2216
None of the companies described the companies as a recall .	-3.1857
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon dioxide emissions rules .	-2.9373
But nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-1.9664
Costs for automobile manufacturers to install plants to neutralize the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles are also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.1009
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also charged with covering the powerful car companies and ignoring signs of the problem .	-9.2848
Companies are trying to avoid the errors of Volkswagen that could regulate the use of so-called shutdown devices , which could regulate emissions in order to comply with the rules when a car was tested but reduce normal driving conditions .	-5.0204
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged with others being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.3987
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics was arrested in the engine development of Audi in Germany .	-2.4276
The former manager , Zaccheo Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-2.6075
At the beginning of this year , Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the authorities accused Audi of having installed a system to circumvent emissions regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States was extended .	-4.3877
The inclusion of Audi in the investigation could strain Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to the profit of Volkswagen .	-3.4153
This Saturday ’ s Message to the Isar	-4.6453
The city wants to protect the Isar .	-1.3479
To join the Isar visitors too , on Saturday a river runs through Munich , which has a special message .	-5.1320
Anyone who draws it again to the Isar on Saturday will see a big river between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-4.5174
And this is not a common river , with Isar tourists .	-3.0893
Otherwise the building department wants to clarify .	-4.2998
On the river you can see a large amount of information .	-4.4991
It shows a Müllberg .	-1.1802
The beginning of a public relations campaign to appeal to Isar visitors .	-2.2478
The motto " true love is ... " is intended to sharpen understanding for Isar as a protective wild river .	-4.1625
Even last summer the flow crossed the Isar , and this year too there were further actions and measures to achieve a prudent and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-8.5420
Murderless Crop Nases and Laughter Against Surgency	-4.1182
Mordillo was temporarily one of the most published cartoon drawings , the noses of his figures are his trademark .	-4.0176
With 85 , the Argentine still draws and works on a film .	-4.4564
His message : Laughter , ' for there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.6811
Guillermo Mordillo was born on 4 August 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.8333
In the first years as an artist , he beat him as a draftsman for congratulations cards , among other things - which frustrated him .	-5.3048
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when in my job lost , " he once said .	-1.8701
After stations in Lima , New York and Paris , he succeeded in breaking through the late 1960s : with the release of his cartoons in Paris Match and then in the " star " and other leading magazines around the world .	-4.0024
Even in China Mordillo found many fans .	-1.6028
Time and again the artist was inspired by cities .	-3.0336
Large , roundy mordillo figures are found in drawings with the Pisa tower , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-8.4276
According to his own statements in the early morning , he is still on the character table , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.7745
Through calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , t-shirts , plush-pets and watches his drolling figures continue to be distributed worldwide .	-4.8798
For six years he has also worked on a drawing film and a TV series with his characters .	-3.6357
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a giraffe - Mordillos most popular animal in his drawings - that has a thousand boys as opponents .	-4.0121
For the first time , his figures speak in the 3D movie , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .	-4.2530
" I do not know exactly what they will say it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-1.8265
The script is not written by him .	-1.8692
That is why it relies more on the TV series , which , like its original drawings , is produced without word .	-3.6170
Lavendel from Provence Threatened Climate Change	-1.9424
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened by climate change .	-1.8728
The lavender is declining because of the drought and disease-transmitting insects , which causes great headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-4.5329
Eric Chaisse , expert of the CRIEPPAM agricultural research institute in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively at risk because the plant was exposed to the effects of climate change in recent years , which brought much less rain in in spring and much more in the autumn .	-4.3867
This has an impact on the life of Lavendel .	-8.0276
There is also a small cicade , a microbacterium that transfers dwarf cicades , and in very dry weather there are many of them . '	-3.5418
The stakes are high .	-1.6780
Lavender oil is not only attractive to tourists , it is also very important for perfume and cosmetics .	-4.2267
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long plant tubes with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , underdeveloped and either missing or weakened .	-2.5077
So we have fewer parts of essential oil . '	-1.4245
The solutions considered include better water distribution and the slowdown of evaporation from the ground , but also the spraying of the plants with a protective mixture of sound and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to dry .	-4.1615
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year existence this year .	-2.4734

The murder of a journalist underscores the growing threat in Mexico	-2.0217
Weekly newspaper Riodoce usually meets on Wednesday to review their plans for reporting on the recent chaos in the State of Sinaloa through organized crime , corrupt officials and incessant drug wars .	-4.5527
But on this day , in the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-1.7986
They have been informed that it is important to change their routines .	-1.8186
Two high-level journalists are discussing what feels safer : to take their children into the office , who were the goal of attacking grenades in 2009 , or leaving them at home .	-4.3083
Security experts have written three words on a board at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-2.4505
You ask the reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , extend perceptions and abdominal feelings .	-3.7689
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the salary of the government or the cartel , a catalogue of criminals that make the chaos of Mexico dangerous .	-3.2996
There is no retirement from violence , and while the bodies are increasing throughout the country , there are more and more journalists : at least 25 since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 , 589 are standing under federal protection after attacks and threats , and so far there have been at least seven deaths in seven states this year .	-4.9581
Among the latter is their publisher and inspirer of Riodoce , the co-founder of Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-2.7856
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be journalist , " Valdez wrote in one of his numerous books about violence in connection with drugs .	-2.5929
T-shirts show their smiling face with glasses or their typical panamahut .	-23.8477
The workshop takes place less than two months after his death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , Paranoia .	-2.5245
Although a special Federal Prosecutor was set up in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , according to the Committee for the Protection of Journalists , it has only launched two criminal proceedings .	-3.8358
As with most of the thousands of murders associated with drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists are rarely brought to justice .	-2.9701
In Riodoce , they still insist on treating the violence of Sinaloa , despite being uncomfortable and even though the terrain is even more treacherous now .	-9.2426
Without information about the killers , without justice , the meeting has little benefit to discuss security , Ibarra says .	-2.4865
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.4066
'Until we know why , we distrust all . '	-8.2300
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the national capital of Culiacan .	-2.9566
He only managed to go a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , forced from his car and 12 times was shot on him , pro, . , , or , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.6744
The shooter went away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.3680
Valdez was 50 years old .	-0.6677
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.2983
Rumours tend to fly freely around in Culiacan .	-1.6551
But there is virtually nothing silent about Valdez .	-2.6426
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival factions fight here to fill the vacuum .	-3.2028
It does not matter that every day in Sinaloa someone or several people are shot on the streets or that the graveyard is full of decorated two-storey mausoleums for drug kings that are larger than many houses for the living .	-4.4317
Forget for a minute that there is a state of " calm " if only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-3.6477
Nevertheless , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , has broken with the blame that he could not protect his friend .	-3.0920
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.2536
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.0420
This release may have angered the sons , suspected gean-members bought each copy of the issue once it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-3.8683
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for its own security after seizing another newspaper that had published the same history .	-3.0824
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-1.7765
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed that he would always be there .	-2.0262
He worked in 2003 as an experienced reporter for Noroeste when he joined five colleagues to establish Riodoce and sold US $ 50 in shareholdi.	-4.4471
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to run journalism without encountering the drugs problem , " Bojorquez said .	-2.4065
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for courageous and honest reporting , and sales and advertising increased .	-2.6194
Reporters loved to be able to publish hard-hit investigations without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that nobody else dared to treat .	-3.1881
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria Moors Cabot Prize " for her reporting in Latin America .	-2.6484
In the same year Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award of the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing Mexican drug history wherever it led .	-2.8300
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.2912
" I want to continue living , " he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.1730
Drug trafficking in Sinaloa is a way of life , " he said last October in an interview with Rompeviento TV .	-2.0775
" You have to take on the task that you , as a journalist , have - either that or you are playing the stupid . to , and .	-12.4993
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do with so many deaths ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-2.5571
The Riodoce team misses Valdez , the fun bird who could curse like a dockworker , the friend who was generous with embarrassments and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-3.8460
They relied on his routine .	-1.5834
He would always bear his hat .	-1.3934
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.6838
Now they ask : was his love of routine his corruption ?	-1.7579
His death , too , has forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work and how they can stay alive .	-7.1565
" You don 't like it if you are concerned with their women , their children , their clean shops , their secret runways " to move drugs .	-4.4127
" These things were not permitted , " said Bojorquez .	-1.8290
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.0980
Trust its own instincts .	-1.5340
If it smells wrongly , it will stay away .	-2.6172
The trouble is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarreal said that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier . "	-3.3066
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa - just as they do in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero and other states , where a toxic mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions and corrupt government officials is at home .	-3.4220
The landscape is constantly changing .	-1.2412
In the room where Riodoce staff met for security training , there were suddenly no mobile phones allow.	-12.6582
Outside , two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shadow of a tree .	-3.0559
You were charged with the national government to protect the Riodoce offices in a four-storey building in a middle class area of Culiacan .	-3.5792
Half in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of police officers , who the governor himself described as untrustworthy .	-3.2849
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountains , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.4574
For this week ’ s issue , Riodoce has looked at three main stories .	-6.3254
There was the murder of the brother of the former well-known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-2.1002
They also had an exposé to government spending that focused on the governor ’ s home town .	-2.7716
And there was a group that kidnapped in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , a block from the Public Prosecutor ’ s office .	-2.8061
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so it was necessary to be careful when writing what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug traffickers and authorities .	-4.1471
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost all political levels throughout the century .	-3.4542
Recently , several PRI governors have been accused of corruption for high-quality cases .	-2.6724
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of El Chapo Guzman missed a military attack .	-8.9655
Just a few months earlier , the readers would have seen the column of Valdez as the best informed source of abduction .	-3.2720
" Previously we already knew what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " for its slim body stature .	-3.4473
'Now all channels of communication with our sources are broken . '	-1.8907
The office of Valdez has been turned into a storage room for signs and stickers protesting against the murders of journalists , because employees have become something they themselves would never have expected : activists on behalf of the press .	-3.8725
Reporter Miriam Ramirez took a few signs and the next morning went to a demonstration for another journalist to the Public Prosecutor 's office .	-3.9852
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez had been killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-1.7535
A burnt body was discovered and officials say , based on DNA tests that it is his .	-1.8119
Journalists have become more vocal throughout the country by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on walking paths and buildings .	-3.7174
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington , trying to gather international support for justice in the Valdez case .	-3.2564
At a meeting with the Governor of Sinaloa on the day after the murder of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying and killing journalists because they said the truth .	-7.2291
She has since asked that it be divided up again by the government because it is concerned that its anger has violated its objectivity .	-3.5763
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were " surrounded " by organised crime , government officials involved and an indifferent society .	-2.1701
In his last book , " Narco-Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on the orders of politicians and security forces under a blanket with organised crime .	-3.7898
Last year , the Articulo 19 media guardian group attributed more than half of the attacks on police and official journalists .	-3.6348
" In Mexico you die because they want you to keep the mouth , " said Ramirez .	-1.9507
Obviously , the murders have a deterrent effect .	-1.8338
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-2.0063
Your body was found along with a note supposedly signed by the Zetas cartel : ' I am here for my reports ' .	-2.7946
A computer keyboard and headphones were next to their separate head .	-1.9271
Some branches have chosen to close like the newspaper El Norte in the northern border state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-2.6354
Others continue , as El Mananana did by Nuevo Laredo after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.5316
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed to the drugs cartel with an editorial on the front page with the title " What do you want from us ? "	-3.9354
Some journalists have fled their homelands or even their country .	-3.0429
It is a painful decision .	-0.7133
It is hard to find work in exile and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-2.2161
And sometimes they are hunted , as appears to be the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who was murdered in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico city three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-5.2473
For those who lag behind and continue the work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-2.7161
Ibarra , who once wanted to be poet , admits that drug trafficking is frightening him .	-2.4932
" Mexico goes to hell , and that is why I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.4333
At midnight last Friday , when the last edition was already finished , the editors of Riodoce sat at the office and drank beer when all their phones began to sum .	-4.9842
A number of shooters with gang rivals and security forces near the seaside resort of Mazatlan had left 19 confirmed deaths .	-2.7871
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of cartel embassies in the region .	-2.0783
From the stone edge , they published the news on the Riodoce website via mobile phone .	-4.0999
The front page had to be changed the next day .	-1.5324
Sirenen hit nearby - another shooting house in the area .	-3.2377
Bojorquez glanced at the police who held guard to see if they were ready .	-3.3173
If they were even afraid , they did not show it .	-2.4283
Under the immense portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose middle finger was visible throughout Sinaloa , Riodoce staff followed his traces .	-3.9698
" How can you only remember to close , " said Bojorquez , " when on the same day that Javier was murdered , the internship asked me to send them to the street for reporting . "	-4.7466
Dinosaurs used camouflage to escape their enemies	-1.7693
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-1.8668
Now researchers have found that the first insights of the incredible nose of a Canadian miner worker were obtained so well that experts described it as " Mona Lisa of Dinosaurs " .	-4.6715
It was so well preserved that they even found that his scalp skin was of reddish brown - and they said that she had something of a " troubled past " .	-4.4620
The Current Biology magazine referred to him as " the best-preserved armored dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world " .	-3.3230
The fossil is a newly discovered type of nodosaur living in the middle of the Credit Age between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-2.9641
His incredibly well preserved state of affairs has amazed researchers describing it as " really remarkable " .	-3.4210
According to reports in National Geographic , the armored plant eater is the best preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.0813
It was found by Shawn Funk when he was at the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.4764
He met something that seemed missing from the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.4968
The fossil he discovered was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-1.7901
They spent the next six years discovering the wild animal within the 2,500 pounds ( 1,100 kg ) of heavy earth clumps .	-2.8763
After all this hard work , the finished result is now ready to be revealed .	-1.8592
" If you blink only a little with your eyes , you could almost believe that it has slept , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist at the Royal Tyrrell Museum where the creature is to be seen .	-3.7402
'It will go into science history as one of the most beautiful and most preserved dinosaur copies - the Mona Lisa of dinosaurs ' .	-3.4133
Researchers have found that , although it is covered with armor and resembles a changing tank , it was probably threatened by meat-eating dinosaurs .	-4.6055
The heavily armored dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predator animals , and used a shielding technique known as counter-shade used by many modern animals .	-3.7293
This would have enabled us to mix better into its environment and escape its enemies , say experts , suggesting that it was threatened by major dinosaurs .	-4.5225
The 110 million years old creature from the Nodosaur family made headlines for the first time in May and is now visible at the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Palaeontology .	-3.6296
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the museum technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team that has spent more than 7,000 hours discovering it carefully .	-10.5847
The amazing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and the form of scales and armor about his body .	-3.6171
They discovered the contradiction , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , meaning that the top of creature was darker than its bottom .	-3.1044
Although the contradiction is customary , the results are surprising , as the size of Borealopelta exceeds by far the size of today 's animals .	-7.7141
It suggests that the dinosaur was hunted by sufficient pressure from meat eating dinosaurs that evolution favored confrontation hiding as a means of survival .	-4.0921
But most contemporary animals using the contract - think of Rehe , Zebras , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than prey , which signals that this nodosaur was exposed to a real struggle for survival .	-5.9483
" Strong predator behavior on a massive , highly armored dinosaur shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous Age have been , " Brown said .	-4.2722
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of the dinosaur was red brown .	-2.0992
Scientists continue to examine the animal for references to his life , including his preserved intestinal content , to find out what it has eaten as his last meal .	-3.8990
They believe that when the dinosaur died , he was driven into a river and driven out into the sea , where he fell on the back to the sea .	-4.4190
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much more domestically than they are today .	-2.9072
" This nodosaure is really remarkable because it is fully covered with preserved scalp , but also maintains in three dimensions and maintains the original form of the animal , " Brown said .	-4.5897
" The result is that today the animal looks almost the same as in the early Credit Age .	-3.4638
You don 't need much imagination to reconstruct it ; if you just slip a little with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is at sleep . "	-5.1686
Creating time was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous dinosaurs , who stood on two legs , permeated the earth .	-4.4650
Although the king of them , Tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-3.0274
This includes the Acrocanthosaurus , a 38 feet ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-2.7516
The scientists , whose latest findings appear in the Current Biology journal , believe that Borealopelta was sunk and mummified after death in the sea .	-4.0884
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub in the Suncor Millenium Mine on March 21 , 2011 near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-2.7893
According to the museum , it is the best preserved armored dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is complete from the snout to the hip .	-3.3819
The creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 meters ) long and weighed up to 3,000 pounds ( 1,300 kg ) .	-2.6083
It contained two 20-inch lengths of tips that went from its shoulders .	-4.2547
The researchers believe that the armoured plant eating was flooded by the western Canada until a flooded river flooded it into the open sea .	-3.9909
But the underwater burial of the dinosaur kept his armor in exquisite detail .	-2.6205
The stoned remains of this special copy are so well preserved that the skin remains still cover bumpy plates along the dinosaur .	-5.0391
As Michael Greshko wrote for National Geographic , such a level of conservation is as rare as a profit in the lottery .	-2.5575
The more I look at it , the more confusing it will .	-8.6761
Stoned remains of the skin still cover the bumpy plates that carry the skull of the animal .	-4.0744
His right front feet lies at his side , his five fingers are spread up .	-3.4597
I can count the scales on his sole ' .	-1.7980
In the Thunderstorm : Mass carambolage on A8 : Many injured	-2.5394
Victory accident on the A8 Thursday evening : almost 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.6278
There are numerous injured , kilometre-long traffic jams and jams . in the .	-9.3665
On the Stuttgart-München motorway ( A8 ) , about 20 people were injured on Thursday afternoon at a mass carambolage .	-9.7706
According to the police , at 5 p.m. , between the Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( district of Aichach-Friedberg ) during a thunderstorm , there were almost 30 vehicles , including probably trucks .	-9.5670
The exact number of injured was not available at first .	-3.7527
These are light to medium-sized injuries , a police spokesman said .	-2.8895
A great deal of rescue vehicles was at the accident point .	-2.6318
The A8 was completely blocked in the direction of Munich .	-2.0030
In the direction of Munich , a traffic jam formed around ten kilometres long .	-4.4478
As an AZ reporter reports , there have also been massive disabilities on the counter-risk railway - by numerous jukes .	-11.2610
The fire brigade listed the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who are now expected to be sensitive penalties .	-4.1175
Shortly after 18 : 45 there was a second accident on the A8 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.5100
There has been a conflict between a car and a car .	-2.8278
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the accident point .	-9.4979
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests " Comfort Check-in "	-1.0961
It is a moment that almost everyone has experienced before : nothing looks like you are in the train and sleep .	-4.9150
Or you are deeper in your work and have just a brilliant thought .	-3.1803
And then : pufff .	-0.8313
Come the Schaffner and wake up an imgently or tear the passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-4.3047
Ticket control .	-0.9522
But the times of interruption are over .	-10.9798
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing safe ticket control .	-2.8090
You just confirm by mobile phone that you take your seat and thus devalue the ticket .	-3.1994
Currently a test operation runs on two routes .	-2.5801
" When the offer comes up , we expand it .	-3.9686
It is expected to be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a railway speaker .	-3.4974
Comfort Check-in calls the train the devaluation of tickets without a sheep .	-3.7459
To be able to use them , however , some conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or a tablet .	-3.6526
And you must have booked an online ticket - what most passengers already do .	-11.8757
You also have to buy the DB navigator via the app of the train , which is anyway the most convenient way to book tickets .	-4.4376
Finally , a seat reservation is needed .	-2.3425
Because the " Comfort Check-in " works as it is : you rise into the train , your ticket is called " My Tickets " .	-4.7626
A button for electronic devaluation will then appear for test customers .	-3.1221
The train companions receive on their mobile devices a notification that passenger X is in the train and takes the seat Y booked .	-4.1433
When train accompanied by train ticket control , he knows there is a passenger with already devalued online ticket .	-5.2238
You can therefore sleep on , continue working , let alone .	-3.8484
The " Check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the railway - which in turn should take advantage of passengers .	-3.6205
" If you want to travel without ticket control by our train accompanying staff , just check in in the DB Navigator yourself .	-4.5892
This enables passengers to make their travel time more personal by train , " says Michael Peterson , Marketing Executive Board of DB long-distance traffic . the of , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.5192
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.1907
Those who often drive trains know that , alongside delays and missed trains , the train ticket controls are among the biggest scares .	-5.2169
You often have yourself , but in any case one of the passengers does not have all the documents you need to devalue online tickets .	-4.0924
Either credit card or personnel card or otherwise a document is missing .	-4.0566
The result is endless discussions between train attendees and passengers , leading to poor mood in the department or wide space and delays in controlling their own ticket and , in the end , takes the Schaffner the time to take care of other concerns .	-6.3107
Only a small number of test customers can still use the new service .	-1.6072
And that even at ICE 915 Dortmund-Stuttgart and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen .	-2.3235
Other train numbers on the same route are not yet available .	-3.4971
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : ' Whose Streets ? '	-1.5017
On August 9 , 2014 , Brittany Ferrell was shaken to her core .	-1.8558
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the born in St. Louis sat on the bed of an airbnb apartment she rented and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-3.7834
She stumbled over a post from someone from the High School .	-2.0525
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " said it there .	-3.2602
Confused , because no one else posted the information on their feed , she closed Facebook and opened Twitter . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-15.7105
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retweeted on their timeline .	-2.5039
The rapper from the St. Louis area was doing live to tweet the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-3.6175
He posted a picture of Brown 's lifeless body that was extended on the street and would stay there four hours .	-3.0999
" That is wild , " Ferrell thought .	-2.2278
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.4059
She took her mobile phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield drive later in the .	-10.4996
There were photos of the police tape and people who shouted , and by a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who was born of a sign : ' Ferguson 's police have just killed my unarmed son ! '	-4.9970
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a beautiful dog .	-3.0039
In another video , she said , another policeman desecrated his gun and said : " I will kill you ... animals all . "	-3.6090
" This is not customary , " Ferrell remembered her statement .	-2.3085
'This is not the kind of murder we have used to and which we can typically call it . '	-2.6368
At this moment I felt bulky frost .	-2.7836
I was angry and wept ' .	-1.8391
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.3941
After landing at 23 p.m. she picked her 6-year-old daughter from her father 's house and decided that the two would go to Ferguson next morning .	-8.4663
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson during the next three years is the theme of a new documentary , " Whose Streets ? " , in the cinemas from the 11. , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.0541
It is a story of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resilience from the perspective of people living in the Community and filling the streets to demand answers .	-3.2310
When Ferrell went to Ferguson with her daughter , wearing a flower dress and a suitable crown , the two discussed a conversation that they had numerous times before this morning » about the black experience and the black state <unk> .	-4.9540
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to fight for what they believe in ? " She remembered what she said .	-3.2523
" We are now going to Ferguson , because the police killed a 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-2.7347
I couldn 't take her with her , " Ferrell said later .	-2.7928
" What happened today is a culmination of what happened in the past .	-2.3705
It must be known and seen and raised .	-3.2454
It must be well developed , not only activism and organisation , but also know the various layers of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to free ourselves .	-3.8192
Although I am lucky to give her an experience in which she personally experiences no glaring racism , she is no different from the next black women 's child .	-3.8396
I have the feeling that I would do her a bad service to keep her away from it . '	-3.2371
The first station when they arrived in Ferguson was at the South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority , which became a campsite when the activists waited for the possible non-charge of Officer Darren Wilson .	-4.4618
Ferrell and her daughter have connected to a local business holder who made lunch there .	-3.5718
They prepared and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-2.0788
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-2.1374
" My activism changed totally after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was president of the Minority Student Nurses Association as a student at the University of Missouri-St. Louis , and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.1345
" I had no experience in organizing .	-1.2071
Everything has happened . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-7.7755
Weeks later , during an evening demonstration , Ferrell met one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.8231
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.0086
A question came to Ferrell : ' Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? '	-3.3877
This skepticism was fed by countless cases of people , often white , in a community that benefited from their pain and resilience .	-3.3066
As Folayan recently stated in an interview , " We heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not centre their votes and we wanted to do it differently . "	-3.5117
Folayan had already collaborated with the then co-director Damon Davis , an artist in the field known for his activism around death rows . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.9145
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals followed the team of " Whose Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-3.6929
" This documentary film is not someone who speaks for us or talks to us .	-2.2308
'That was the main thing for me , as these people are presented , because that is how I will be presented . '	-4.1437
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement is not a Messias leader , but a community that comes together , " said Folayan - she proved to be the most open participant in the film .	-3.7635
As a result , documents from " Whose Streets ? " show surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as she falls in love and marries her wife .	-2.9767
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she first saw the finished product .	-2.1065
'But I have understood that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the humanisation of black people ' .	-7.7947
Furthermore , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader Black Live Matter movement .	-2.5734
Two of the three founders of the movement , which , following the killing of the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 , characterized the film " BlacklivesMatter " in social media , are identified as gay .	-3.5769
" Black , gay women in management have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and so we are constantly fighting on various fronts .	-3.7346
Black , gay women must bear the main burden of everything . '	-1.9922
Folayan agreed to note that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.3161
However , it insists that " this is not an affirmative type of action " where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of its identity .	-3.3479
" She was the person who upset this energy , " she said .	-2.0696
" It is no coincidence , although she was at the forefront , because a life on these crosses as a black , gay woman is so much at stake . .	-8.1477
You can feel your energy through the screen . '	-2.1303
The news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but racial connections between the municipality and the police remain .	-3.0990
Ferrell is probable for 2 <unk> years due to the blocking of a motorway at a demonstration .	-3.2566
She describes the social atmosphere of the area she calls her home : " A chaos " .	-3.0883
Nevertheless , she clashes with a singing and feels committed to this memory since she went to the street in Ferguson three years ago .	-4.4822
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.8226
It is our duty to win .	-1.0722
We must love and support each other .	-1.1909
We have nothing to lose , except our chains . '	-1.9030
From " Dream " to " Greater Diving " : TV readers discuss bit gallery	-3.4285
The bit gallery moves people even though it is far from built .	-3.2647
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south of the pedestrian zone has divided the population into advocates and opponents since the first presentation in 2009 .	-3.2102
Cold is hardly an issue .	-3.6719
The subject is also discussed on our Facebook page " People 's Friend Bitburg " .	-2.8004
While some say to the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be really class " ( Nicole Schausen ) , comes from the other side : " Needs no man " ( Siggi Betting ) or quite simply : " Greater Dawn ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-4.8488
While the advocates rely on a gallery to draw more customers into the city , which also benefits other shops , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will bleed .	-5.2046
In addition , the gallery is planned exactly on the site where the farm market hall , where 13 direct marketers offer their products .	-4.0779
This will stop at the start of the construction work .	-2.8988
The gallery makers want to integrate a market hall into the new construction - to the Beda Square with the possibility of seating outside .	-3.9756
Simone Rooms : " We have been purchasing at the farm market hall for many years .	-3.1597
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the wives of the countryside , are alw.	-8.3755
We also discovered the butchery for us .	-2.0409
We would like to see this offer maintained during and above all after the construction of the gallery .	-3.2927
That is also the case in other cities .	-2.7753
The small market hall in Frankfurt in particular is interesting . '	-2.3890
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketers are located in a market hall in the gallery , the amount of rental matters .	-4.2798
However , the new project should not be very low . '	-3.6262
Eva Kilic : " What shopping palaces in Bitburg ?	-1.9602
Whether clothing , shoes , drugs or supermarkets , I find this unnecessary .	-2.7897
There is enough of this in our city .	-3.0611
You can see how many shops stand empty - some of them for months and years .	-3.4162
However , since there is not even a proper weekly market , it is all the more important that we maintain at least the market hall .	-3.5412
After all , the goods offered there are fresh and are mostly offered directly by the producer and are affordable .	-11.2264
As you can see , shops in a shopping centre are rented only by larger companies , because the rentals there are often not sustainable for a retailer .	-4.1425
Sadly , there is almost no longer any special transaction , and what remains will probably disappear . '	-4.9521
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping centre with a market hall does not fit me together .	-2.0884
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.6773
Above all , where is the farm market hall to go during construction ?	-3.5367
The old edeka would be the solution - even if the bit gallery actually arrives at some point .	-3.4477
Or is the specter Bit gallery already managing to distribute all businesses from in Bit? '	-11.5001
George Marquet : " That will simply not work .	-1.7929
And no one needs a shopping centre that is empty .	-2.8453
I think it would have been better to promote a proper farming market , rather than this gallery .	-3.4338
But there is no longer any place for a farm market hall thanks to the madness of many - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg .	-4.3899
When the farm market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear . '	-7.7113
A matching similarity : Artist creates portraits with Chelsea Mannings DNA	-2.2289
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces - white , black and brown , which are almost imperceptible - hanging on cables from the ceiling .	-4.3436
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg , who were sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-2.9925
Manning sent the sections from Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst served a 35-year-old prison sentence after being classified as secret diplomatic reports on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.6066
The new exhibition opened on 2 August is called A Becoming Resemblance ( A matching similarity ) .	-2.3166
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline united its expertise in technology , computer sciences and art , and manning , a trans-woman and leading dissident whose conviction was converted by Barack Obama when he had only three days in office .	-4.4485
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of the DNA extracted by manning , has created from the 30 portraits what someone might look like with these genomic data , has a sharp , albeit somewhat intellectual comment not only on the formability of DNA data - which many ways can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also created to identity .	-11.5542
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has spoken openly about identification as a woman since her puberty , was condemned in 2013 for 20 indictments , including six infringements of the spy law , computer fraud and theft .	-3.7819
The prison was oppressed by her image , so much so that there was only one photo - a grainy black and white selfish in which manning is visibly uncomfortable sitting on a driver 's seat and wearing a platinum-blond wig - with which she was associated .	-5.6894
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg just came from the great success of her 2012 project ' Stranger Visions ' .	-2.5133
In it , the artist produced portraits of foreign artifacts such as cigarette dummy and chewing gum by extracting the DNA from the waste to produce an image of what these people might look like .	-4.5377
That was the time when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.0361
" They interviewed Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and they wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg at a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.5828
And she could not visit at that time and she could not be photographed , so you contacted Chelsea and asked her whether she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.3330
The artist and her imprisoned muses have become unequal letter friends who have exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-3.7389
They even created a " suppressed images " , illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , who foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's ruling would convert and be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.0407
Obama ’ s actual release in a military prison in Kansas was a welcome kind of happy meeting , just a few days after the book was published .	-3.5718
There is also something deep and strong now when the exhibition is opened , as Donald Trump is waging a war against government camp companies and transgender troops , in order to find new , tweetable ways to continue to flame the rigid divisions that he should actually resolve .	-6.3994
When Dewey Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a particular reason " .	-2.4170
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , manning , with her overwhelming signature , including ( the " i " in heart 's family name ) called for an end to the " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which were gender , race , sexuality and culture . "	-5.3311
On the opposite wall , its mitochondrial DNA sequence is written in pencil - a thousand feof Cs and Gs and As .	-4.1834
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by including the 200 letters ( or nucleotides after the advanced scientific lexicon of the artist ) how astonishingly similar , at least biologically , we are all .	-3.2572
" What people hopefully will take with them is that our genome does not care who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spurious Memories , is also visible .	-3.7133
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so 30 of these stories are . "	-2.2875
The last piece in the exhibition stored in its own room is a page from the above mentioned comic novel .	-3.6617
It shows manning how it appears in hand with an open-air phone from the disciplinary barracks of the United States like King Kong .	-4.0977
" If they coldly your speech , they have won , " says .	-3.2913
'So never stop the mouth ' .	-2.6891
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist , who greets Philadelphia .	-6.4404
'I still get a skin when I talk about it ' .	-3.1648
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - as foreseen in the comic book anticipated - but if it should do it , it will be welcomed by the masks in the middle of the room , by its own genomic simulators , which collapse as hordes of protesters .	-6.1540
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 " manning 's stature ) , where their genetic haplo groups were written with pencil .	-4.3544
" In the past I had them on the wall , but I wanted them to feel like a crowd , " said Dewey Hagborg of portraits .	-2.6759
'I wanted it to feel like a mass movement formed with Chelsea , like the movement behind its liberation . '	-2.7486
Searching for killing professor at the University of Northwestern and an employee at Oxford University . in . , , , , , , , ,	-7.2933
A nationwide human hunt is underway for a professor at the Northwestern University and an employee of the University of Oxford , who are sought as suspects after a man in a luxurious apartment in Chicago had been broken with fatal injuries .	-5.0420
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) were issued arrest warrants for murders because of their alleged involvement in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell-Duranleau , as shown by the files of the Cook County office .	-3.3169
The documents say that Cornell-Duranleau , 26 , died after several sticks .	-1.8133
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the corpse was discovered on July 27 .	-2.1955
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries on his body .	-2.6721
Cornell-Duranleau was declared dead at the place of events , and detectives investigate the stitches as murder , while police actively looking for the two suspects , said officials .	-3.6215
Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University since 2007 . in and , , or , are .	-7.6619
Alan K. Cubbage , Vice-President of University Relations , said in an e-mail statement that Lathem has now been let down and excluded from entering the Northwestern University campus .	-4.2324
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University cooperates in this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-2.7008
Warren is a senior treasury assistant at the University of Oxford .	-8.2071
A spokesman of the University and the Somerville College said in an e-mail statement that " we are in contact with the police in the United Kingdom and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible . "	-4.0386
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to turn up .	-2.3405
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said he urged the suspects to stand up to the authorities .	-2.9129
" The police have an idea of their place of residence , and our efforts to locate them reinforce them , " said Guglielmi .	-2.9383
Guglielmi said that local , regional , and national authorities help to find the suspects .	-1.7383
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand Plaza building , who had just received a mysterious tip , saying that something happened in 1008 .	-3.6387
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.9902
Guglielmi said that it is unclear whether the incident took place on 27 July .	-2.3550
It was confirmed by security cameras that Lathem and Warren were in the building .	-2.4090
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " Guglielmi said .	-1.7297
The Grand Plaza management team issued a statement to the inhabitants : " The police is currently working on the timeline and the background of the victim and researching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic incident . "	-3.8283
'We will complete the WADA roadmap in the near future ' - the Russian Vice-Prime Minister Mutko	-2.5417
The Russian Vice-Prime Minister Vitaly Mutko said it will not take long for the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) to be implemented for the restoration of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency ( RUSADA ) .	-3.0774
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road map , RUSADA has the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-2.6189
The WADA roadmap was updated in this respect , " Mutko declared on Thursday .	-2.1159
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code describing the criteria for reinstating RUSADA and recently published on the organization 's website .	-3.4900
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give cause for concern to Russia .	-2.5197
" Everything was announced , everything is implemented .	-1.6584
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.9824
One of the criteria mentioned in the list , however , states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation authorised by the Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.7010
Regarding the matter , Mutko said : ' We are carrying out the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake .	-3.6668
All the measures have been implemented .	-1.3348
But there were no state programmes , and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-2.7867
Mutko ’ s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-2.5439
In conversation with Russian Sales Office RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov added problems in the past in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : ' We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-3.6316
Nobody intended to accept this report unconditionally , " Smirnov added .	-2.6738
In November 2015 , in the wake of the WADA doping scandal , RUSADA was excluded from the implementation of controls on doping in R.	-7.1340
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and UK Anti-Doping ( UKAD ) .	-1.9496
After visiting the Organization 's headquarters in Moscow in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli declared that RUSADA moves " in the right direction " in order to be re-again .	-7.6960
For the time being , Aldi is no longer selling eggs	-2.1000
The groups of companies informed this .	-2.6198
It is a mere precautionary measure that no health impairment could continue to be assumed , as stated in the communication .	-5.1980
As of now , only eggs are likely to be supplied to Aldi , which have been demonstrably tested negatively on fipronil-containing anti-luminaire .	-4.8489
Aldi wants to create clarity and transparency among its customers .	-2.7654
The start ups that will help your company not become the next Uber	-10.1531
Amy Errett wanted to measure happiness with your employee at your e-commerce start-up , but the surveys did not work .	-3.2469
Answers were often vague , little helpful or , worse still , fraudulent .	-2.2843
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not count on the process .	-2.3519
" There was simply no consistency and objectivity , " said Errett , who operates the 75 person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Company Madison Reed .	-2.9212
She called people from outside for help .	-1.7203
A new breed of Human Resources start-ups is growing to help businesses find out how their employees feel .	-10.1756
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee commitment , it enables companies to carry out surveys , address special groups and demographic groups , offer employees anonymity and complaint hotlines , and in some cases whistleblowers to bypass the C-Suite executives and directly address the management board .	-4.4463
" You now have tools like Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health , but where is the fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employees commitment .	-3.3160
Save said that they have a better insight into what your employees think and feel gained with Glint in the three years .	-3.6075
In addition to the snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat card from the company that shows at a glance what units most complaints have and which executives have low consent results - so that you can drill up why .	-4.6896
Companies come to realise that they must remain at the top of the workplace culture , so that you are not the next Uber involved in scandals since a former employee has published a blog post describing an environment of harassment that punished those who have spoken .	-5.1191
For start-ups like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business possibility .	-2.3558
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could have more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the financial technical site Let 's Talk Payments .	-2.6434
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize poor behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity in the midst of Uber-Fall in the early this year .	-3.9918
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.3430
Uber recently logged in as a client .	-1.6761
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailor-made pulse surveys , collect confidential answers in real time and view the heat cards of your problem areas .	-3.6396
It also offers an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behaviour .	-2.9620
And when the Managing Director is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-2.7650
" The Court of Public Opinion has collected regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , founder and CEO of Convercent .	-2.9463
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethically , it can experience costly consequences through consumer boycott , worker fluctuation and complaints , Quinlan said .	-3.4851
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has deployed Convercent for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have an easy way to reach their headquarters .	-4.1397
Previously , if an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or e-mail for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that he was taken seriously .	-3.4969
It was often an intimidation and uncomfortable experience , said James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays ’ General Counsel , who said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-3.3630
Now that Convercent uses , problems previously identified and addressed by leaders who were in offices in cities or states - such as discrimination , harassment or unfair practice - can be rapidly identified and addressed .	-4.4559
" I can get closer to this holistic 360-degree view of experience with employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-3.2019
'We also protect our shareholders from employment and litigation ' .	-2.0064
Companies began to take ethics , values and employee commitment more seriously in 2002 , after Arthur Andersen collapsed because of ethical infringements due to Enron scandal , said Quinlan .	-3.5070
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realized that you could not prevent their dirty linen went online .	-3.5547
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.2445
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service and burden companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-3.1786
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the consent of Venture Capital investors who have supported both start-ups .	-2.7462
Convercent received $ 10 million in February from companies such as Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , increasing the total capital to $ 47 million .	-2.7581
Glitters secured $ 10 million in November from Bessemer Venture Partners and brought all its funding to $ 60 million .	-3.0246
These investments are hardly surprising , given the networked nature of companies , culture , and venture capital .	-2.0391
There is a growing complex of research showing that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done to date .	-3.0570
In competitive markets such as Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only deployment .	-2.4928
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-2.9809
" If people are glad to be in a company that belongs to their voices , and that the work you do is worth doing , they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefits and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-3.9691
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees are involved and engaged .	-3.6244
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and deployment of the employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-3.8933
Data about employee commitment according to the experts in the workplace culture is important .	-3.2008
But the data is useless if a company ’ s managers do not take action .	-3.3770
Indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may be expected that change is on the way .	-2.9646
And if the change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can breed disappointments and discourage employees .	-4.1729
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the business management company Kotter International , who has seen companies relying too much on the collection of data .	-3.6269
" For if you do not follow , staff will ask themselves , " Have you really heard me ?	-3.8471
Do you care about this ?	-1.7448
Who do you not care about why should I ? '	-3.0525
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , saved .	-3.3873
And after collecting feedback from frustrated employees , it was capable of reorganizing several teams within the company through the speed of decision-making and the quality of communication , and adding communication training to address the problems .	-3.9153
At Ruby Tuesday , the company always gains new insights into its employees , and it hopes in the long term that this will lead to a better commitment of workers in an industry known for its high turnover .	-5.5003
" If you are not obliged to create a culture of transparency , you will lose the people , " said Vitrano .	-1.6896
" And if you lose people , you lose customers too .	-2.0859
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-1.9576
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins	-10.5562
It ’ s up to 23 o ’ clock when a lot of UCLA football players entertain on one side of the team ’ s new training fields on the campus .	-4.5534
Some have excluded their tricot components and show the back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-3.3857
For a good part of the team , these inactive minutes are a lunch break .	-8.4535
Players registered at the summer courses will return to their final examinations after the three-hour exercise before they return to the Water Football Center next morning at 6 : 30 a.m.	-4.0412
" This is a real tretmühle for the guys the next three days , " said Bruin coach Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-3.3065
The NCAA eliminates two day exercises to facilitate the burden of players and has actually extended their days - at least until the Friday final .	-3.4882
Therefore , the first three UCLA trainings should start at 19 : 15 in order to meet the players ' already packed timetables .	-4.5123
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the bruins postponed the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and carried out practical exercises during the summer school for the first time during Mora ’ s six gaming hours in Westwood .	-4.4918
They will take 18 exercises during August 20 before the start of the formal game preparations for their start against Texas A & M in September .	-4.6780
Mora said he supported the NCAA regulatory change , even if they add another point to the multi-player routes .	-3.7557
" We place this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.0125
" And they simply pushed it through , they continue to paint , they are great people .	-2.4676
I think , once we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great . '	-3.2662
UCLA will end its practices once the camp has finished , which , given the clear views of its fields , will not be an easy task in adjacent parking and the adjacent Luskin Center , a high class hotel that has already been cast with footballs that a protective network behind a peat post .	-7.8108
Bruin players should occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora acknowledged that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-3.2674
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-1.8900
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that the people there rent a room and then prepare to record an exercise there .	-4.2105
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is a pretty good business . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.2925
But we have security forces there , and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.2881
We will do the best to do with what we have .	-1.7023
I am therefore not too concerned about this .	-2.5437
We have a plan . '	-0.6419
Facebook wants to intensify factual review in the fight against counterfeit messages	-2.5850
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with false reports to fact reviewers of third parties and display their results under the original contribution , said the world ’ s largest online social network on Thursday , one of its efforts to combat so-called fake news .	-4.3878
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to recognize potential false messages and send them to fact checkers that might display results of the fact check from the original article .	-5.4495
Facebook has been criticized as one of the main distribution points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they have also influenced the 2016 US presidential election .	-2.8417
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters flooded with false stories in the run-up to the presidential election in May , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings , as before the elections there in September .	-4.5656
On Thursday Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact review would be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.0370
" In addition to the knowledge of what stories of fact reviewers of third parties are contested , people want more context to make sound decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook messages in a blog .	-3.9963
She added that Facebook will continue to test his feature to the " related article " and work on other changes to his news feed to reduce wrong news .	-3.5220
Creating a Comic-Roman : A Castle in the History of England	-2.4947
In his recent past , the little Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-3.2171
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history from his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mopha-like Yorkshireman with a preference for historical documents .	-4.2522
" I find it so beautiful to look at the manuscript of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he says hugely .	-7.6978
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands ' .	-1.9522
'A Castle in England ' spans the time from the Middle Ages to the Edward era and documents the families living in Scotney .	-4.0169
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teeth and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project he found unexpectedly emotional .	-2.7981
" I reacted only to the thumb print on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700s working for the Jacobins , " he says .	-3.6907
" That is his thumb !	-2.5848
And letters always smoke , because at that time a fire was ignited because of the light .	-3.7726
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an impact as if it were .	-3.5708
Oh , I love archives ! '	-1.1066
For someone beaten so with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest , I have a little overvalued my welcome " ) , this seems all too nice to be true .	-5.5550
Rhodos spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , watching the archives and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the mounted heads on the walls and the bottles that spent centuries in the ditch .	-3.7037
He wandered through the terrain and the ruins of the ancient castle and spoke with landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes with the artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-3.8929
Then , at night he drank " Whiskey and started writing " .	-1.6041
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , as the National Trust died only in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-2.8318
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , employees just began to look after the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , throw it on the roof .	-8.8622
Diaries , letters from the time of the English Empire , cards that represent who possessed what : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to have fought the two families .	-6.7736
Boys , let everything go its way ! '	-2.5395
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labourer ' , which follows a man who leaves the newly built castle to join the farm revolt of 1381 .	-4.2517
" There is a record of a riot that occurred in 1380 in the castle , in this book entitled ' Knightly Families of Kent and Sussex ' , says Rhodes .	-3.2681
" The farming uprising started in this area and I thought an uprising was a good start .	-2.6995
Perhaps the two are interlinked ? '	-9.9923
Other stories are firmly rooted in the history of the castle - like ' The Priest ' , which tells the history of the Jesuit patent , which the Darrell family hidden for seven years during the English reformation .	-4.7253
Or ' The Smuggler ' , where the smuggler Arthur Darrell was presented from the 18th century , who staged his own burial by filling a coffin with stones ( a discovery that was made only years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.0551
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : " The men seemed to be pretty gauners , repeatedly debt and spend money on things they could not afford .	-4.4545
Other generations of Darrell men resolved their debt crises by marriing rich women - I imagine them as a pile of well-looking guys , with a talent to advertise heirs . '	-3.4581
After the end of his use in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences	-3.2094
He had a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämäki , the site of a sanatorium from the early twentieth century , which has since been recalled by nature .	-4.3882
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-1.1378
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-1.0983
It was like ' Oh , now I have to deal with damned life again ' .	-2.8108
Started Campaign : Marie Chapel , Over 300 Years old in Rhöndorf , covered	-14.9233
With the covering of the 301-year-old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign on Friday to introduce a new roof brand ( Thursday round show ) .	-4.7747
Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and slogan secret until Thursday .	-2.4250
At the end of August there will be a festival on the island of Grafenwerth as the highlight of the campaign .	-3.1866
" Too nice for us .	-1.8028
Or ? " , the makers of the action since yesterday ask the posters at the Rhöndorfer Chapel .	-3.9025
" We do not really think this ( of course ! ) , " they write on their website unlocked yesterday .	-3.3410
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.5471
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-2.3743
Basically , we are firmly convinced that , as Bad Honnefer , we know citizens about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-4.2174
The action is about more than just a " logo and a slogan , it continues to say .	-11.2799
" A single promise must be formulated , one that gives the city a distinctive unique feature . "	-11.6819
After all , they are in competition with other municipalities .	-2.2178
The city of Bad Honnef can cost its new roof brand and campaign an average five-digit amount .	-3.7960
Turkey 's Military Reforms - Erdogan 's Fear of the Army	-1.3167
Every year at the beginning of August , Ankara advises the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) on retirement and transportation in the Officer Corps .	-3.2412
So this week .	-1.9296
At first glance a normal process .	-1.5261
But nothing is routine among Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.0323
The sitting was no longer held in the Building of the General Staff , as before , but in the Prime Minister ’ s office .	-3.9385
Discussions under the chairmanship of the Head of Government have now also been held by the five Vice-Prime Ministers and the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs .	-4.3803
As a result , civilians in the YAS were over-paying .	-3.9860
The government is attracting reins in the military .	-1.8977
Hulusi Akar , Chief of Staff , remains in office , but the Army commanders , the Air Force , and the Navy were deposed .	-4.0969
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admirals .	-1.7644
More than 10,000 soldiers were removed from the army 's ranks - mostly because of alleged connections to the movement of the exile preacher Fethullah Gülen , who sees Erdogan as the wire driver of the coup test .	-4.2604
This week , Ankara has been negotiating for 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-4.0536
Even the day after the coup , Erdogan had called the " God 's Gift " attempt , giving him the opportunity to " fully clean " the of the ar. the , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , and , and , , , , , ,	-9.2933
But does Erdogan really control the army ?	-1.8661
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hürriyet " published an article heading " Unease in the Military Headquarters " .	-2.4688
There were concerns in the general staff about the increasing " Islamisation " of the army , which , among other things , manifested itself in the lifting of the headscarf ban on soldiers , wrote the newspaper .	-4.3235
In any case , the big cleaning up of the army and the security forces contin.	-3.7500
In the middle of July , Erdogan caused further 7395 servants , including 2303 police officers and 546 soldiers .	-3.6138
Erdogan seemed to have tamed the military .	-1.3623
The generals used to be regarded as the real masters of the country .	-3.4527
Three times , they pushed up on their role as guardian of the secular order .	-6.8173
After his 2002 election victory , Erdogan pushed the military ’ s power back step by step , not least with reference to the reforms of the European Union .	-3.6288
Former officers say that Erdogan is targeting the Islamization of the armed forces .	-3.0022
In the " Vocal Europe " magazine , a notably unnamed officer , who was looking for asylum after the coup attempt , fearing persecution abroad , the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and salafists " in a few years ' time .	-4.7827
If so , such a development could not leave NATO cold .	-2.4880
There are also doubts in the alliance following the cleansing of the Turkish army 's .	-3.7891
Leadership structures and operational skills are " weakened " , say NATO diplomats .	-2.4193
Washington Changes the Green Card Rules	-1.3955
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the Green Card rules , President Donald Trump said , quoted by the media .	-1.8150
It envisages reducing legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family-oriented visas .	-3.4667
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-1.8230
The draft legislation is to be discussed in the two Chambers of Congres. the of the . the . .	-7.6471
'This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , save billions of dollars for taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way Green Cards are spent on citizens from other countries ' .	-2.8990
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.1130
This new application procedure will benefit candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " Trump said , quoted by the American media .	-3.2246
The Ministry wants to renovate the route for the Racing Shuttle	-4.0816
Over the past few months , the future of the racing shuttle has been disputed - now it is time to go very quickly .	-5.7250
Before the end of the year it is planned to be built on the route on which the tourist train drives .	-5.6247
In order to ensure the long-term future of the Racing Shuttle , construction work will begin this year , according to the Ministry of Transport .	-4.3670
" With the decision to continue to order and renovate the Ilmenau-Racing route , the country is committed to this major connection , especially for tourism , " declared Secretary of State of Transport Klaus Sühl on Friday in Erfurt .	-5.5378
The cost of repairing the route was around EUR 2.5 million .	-2.5079
Of this sum , the country accounts for 75 % .	-2.4687
The Treaty , on which the shuttle is to be ordered by the country in future , is currently being finally voted , declared Sühl .	-4.5087
The Ministry and the South Thuringian Railway as operator are already in agreement on the technical details .	-2.8913
" This negotiated the road map , the vehicles used and the quality standards , " said Sühl .	-2.7472
The planned contract between the ministry and the railway company will be concluded for a period of 11 years .	-2.4721
Therefore the racing climbing shuttle will be ordered regularly on December 2017 .	-4.3011
The racetrack shuttle is a popular railway link between Ilmenau and Rennsteig stations , especially among tourists .	-3.8747
In recent months , a pilot operation has tested whether the route is being used by sufficiently many people to order it regularly in the future .	-4.5961
The route is also constructive in parts .	-3.2456
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should worry about it .	-1.6520
Just when you thought that it cannot be crazier in 2017 , a new report on technological developments in the sex robots sector comes into being .	-7.4651
Yes , in fact .	-0.9998
Sex robots are currently a big thing .	-1.2851
Recently , the Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) published a report on the development of sex robots over the next five to ten years .	-1.9108
According to Noel Sharkey , emerging professor of robotics and artificial intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of the FRR , we must start taking their rise seriously .	-2.7707
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its form of breast wart and the type of fingernagel .	-3.3481
" People are funny about them , but businesses provide a lot of it and we will see them much more often , " said Mr Sharkey when he published his new report .	-5.3090
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with deliberately human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-7.4186
The user can also " adjust " his robot according to his convictions , while selecting everything from the robot 's eye color to the shape of breast warts to the type or color of his fingernails .	-4.9904
But it becomes even more disturbing because many robots have the " personalities " that a Stepford woman would make progressive .	-3.4611
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.9104
The RealBotix robot , for example , allows its users to adapt their robots to the characteristics they find appealing , such as shypocrisy .	-3.5772
And then there are the Roxxxy Gold Sex robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities like " Frigid Farrah " , which give the impression of shyness and " Wild Wendy " with a " adventurous " personality .	-8.5280
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality as possible " warms the site of True Companion .	-3.0863
So it likes what you like , and it does not like what you do not like , etc .	-2.5054
She also has her moods during the day - how real people !	-3.1224
She can be tired of being fixed on conversation or can be ' in mood ' ! '	-2.7996
There are many worrying aspects of this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace genuine human relationships - but the subordinate female characteristics , allusions of rape by taking a step towards Frigid ( that is , reluctant ) Farrah , worry one most . .	-14.8897
On his site True Companion Roxxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.0733
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men then have no Roxxxy ? " is it said on the site .	-3.4567
However , these sex robots are not just a fetish or just another sex toy .	-2.2740
Its origin and its increasing refinement point to something darker and lower in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-3.4729
Most men , of course , will not keep sex robots , and while the FRR notes its increasing popularity , they remain temporarily on the edge of consumer culture .	-4.2616
But what leaves the peripheral zones can be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time we live in .	-3.9032
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission .	-7.0096
There is a certain overlap that these advanced sex robots appear at a time when the rights of women worldwide are under threat , in which there is a president in the White House who has boasted of attacking women sexually .	-3.9503
The most dissuasive aspect of the television series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of Magd ' ) is not the graphical images , the swallowed bodies and the eyes disappeared , but how realistic this vision works .	-4.4794
The Republic of Gilead is a leap , but at the moment it does not feel like a great leap .	-2.2237
The aim behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as technically possible ( though with pornostar proportions ) .	-2.8755
Their builders want them to feel humane , that they emulate the movement of a real body .	-3.3096
But , when it comes to their ' personalities ' , robots are not real women .	-2.4022
They cannot separate themselves from their pet or simply leave away . , , , or .	-8.8867
They have no mediation or background history , nothing that indicates independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-2.9989
In other words , they are complacent slaves .	-1.4268
Or to put it in the 2017 speech : girls of service	-1.8828
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.1580
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense	-2.1320
The Trump era has become a truism that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also divided families in small format .	-4.1152
In the US there were newspapers about how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s elected relatives .	-3.6375
We are all supposedly striving to burst our filter bubbles .	-2.2908
Less has been noted by Trump ’ s power to bring families together .	-2.5411
I mention this because my cousine , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long worked with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-2.9914
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful impact .	-6.7281
With Trump in the White House , everyone who knows them , including the Republican relationship with which she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and very strange on the same side .	-3.6765
The dining table is certainly a good thing , but it strikes me in another context that this also poses significant risks .	-4.9162
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but the distorting effect of his presidency has the power to push us all to the right .	-2.5825
When we talk about ' normalization ' and Trump , we refer to the terrible possibility that one day his girls will no longer repudiate us .	-3.9512
However , there is an even more terrifying long-term scenario in which Trump Republicans of the right wing " normalize " , suddenly seem to be a concept of sensibility compared to his standards .	-5.0020
I nowadays find myself infected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s urgent version of the crazy – the dog on the car roof , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew what his tax declaration looked like ) – both of which , in fact , occur as a very mild crime compared to Trump .	-5.6909
If Trump goes , the next Republican candidate must be mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvements . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.8669
When my cousin was in the city , we brought our children to the Central Park , the largest of the carousel of the New York park department , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-4.4338
The horses are enormously large , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are slight and the animals are distorted to look full of fear over their own shoulders - extremely dark and the climbing music strange .	-5.3107
So many clichés in a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the skylines become familiar to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city is not just the dream .	-3.7885
Thirty and five years later , and I am still not entirely overlooking the day when I found out that Swiss Cottage is indeed not a Swiss cottage - the subject pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage does not count - but a large circle in northern London .	-4.1012
The Central Park Carousell is still a strange magical experience , however , since two years old , a 11-year-old and two women in the 40s can go on it and all have a great time .	-5.6580
If I could have evaluated the carousel , I would have given it the full number of points , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-3.0440
On the other hand , I was forced this week in a department store to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could perform my credit card .	-3.4360
In the coffee house on the corner of my road it is the same , plus the option to compare the evaluation with a 15 % tip - this to buy something over the store table .	-9.6616
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is .	-3.6470
The poor woman in the department store was excusing grinning while I was tired of having my credit card with five stars .	-4.1384
Moved Oscar Pistorius with chest pain from prison to hospital	-3.0038
Pistorius has left the prison for a hospital for the second time .	-2.3414
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts at his hand joints , which he suffered after a case in his cell , according to the prison authorities .	-4.0767
Pistorius was sentenced to a first death sentence for murders after an appeal by the prosecutors .	-3.3276
He killed steenkamp during the early hours of the Valentine Day in 2013 by shooting them several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his house in Pretoria .	-3.9986
Pistorius claimed that he thought his girlfriend was a night invader hiding in the cabin .	-2.7049
The prosecutors have announced their intention this time to appeal against the six-year prison sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-4.1990
The national law enforcement authority said that it would object to the Supreme Court of South Africa , and the objection could be heard this year .	-2.8347
Pistorius runs the risk of increasing its penalty to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful .	-3.2012
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.8317
As Bauer Arnold finds a Strange Ei	-3.4412
As the last of the Blumberg schools , the fourth classes from foots and Epfenhofen were released into the holidays and secondary schools .	-4.7644
Three of the dismissal students will go to the school in future , four to the real school .	-3.9427
School leader Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Biesental City House in Epenhofen on Tuesday .	-9.9996
As a symbol of school dismissal , the 29 students of the four classes under the direction of Sophia Schumacher and Regine Meder chose a young eagle who grows up in the Hühnerhof but is then released into freedom .	-4.5271
The munter Shar performed a musical entitled " The Eagle in the Hühnerhof " .	-3.6908
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg and let it erupt by his chickens .	-3.0127
Instead of a chicken , a small eagle came out .	-2.3131
But the hope of making a chicken out of him destroyed , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared .	-3.9653
After that , the classes showed three and four in Yvonne Frank ’ s studies a chicken dance .	-3.4660
The hens danced with the young gockels who carried cylinders to bet .	-2.5064
The eagle represents integration , said school leader Angelika Sitte .	-2.5731
The young animal is different from the other young animals ( chickens ) , but it is one of them .	-5.0181
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.0805
His provision is to be free .	-1.9543
She wished every fourth class that he felt accepted in his new school .	-3.6815
Then there was a word of thanks to colleagues , former school leader Michael Müller , who continually steps into shortages of education and parent representatives .	-5.4999
Sophia Schumacher declared the chicken time .	-5.3016
She released her students after two years of teaching very reluctantly because it was a really great time .	-3.9133
Finally , they were able to rely on the four-class .	-3.4862
At the end , all students made a song of summer time and holiday time .	-3.7480
The children were very pleased with this .	-3.7294
Eight first classes are registered for the new school year .	-2.3780
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-1.0482
Two Bulgarians were arrested for illegal camping in Greece , the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television , informed .	-7.2792
On the morning of August 1 , the police arrested a group of illegally camping people in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-2.6446
They were released on the same day , while an inquiry is currently under way .	-2.8761
The Foreign Ministry reported that the Bulgarians were released later .	-1.8739
The Greek authorities have tightened control over the free camp and put significant fines on everyone found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.1353
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-1.8647
The Ministry said that the Court can impose a fine .	-7.0149
Software update for diesel vehicles : What those affected need to know now	-2.5378
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.1693
Diesel drivers must participate in the action ?	-2.8713
The most important questions and answers in the overview .	-1.7717
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group offered software updates for a total of about 5.3 million cars .	-2.5080
They are intended to improve the exhaust behaviour of cars in emission classes euro 5 and in part euro 6 .	-3.7102
Euro-4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-1.8125
Anja Smetanin of ACE Auto Club Europa gives assessments ,	-7.7783
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.3594
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-1.2334
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have chewing software , " says Anja Smetanin .	-9.6021
The Federal Railway Office ( KBA ) has ordered its retrofitting .	-10.4517
How and when will customers be informed of updates ?	-1.8876
Manufacturers have announced a swift implementation in the next few months , but have not yet mentioned an exact date .	-3.2919
Daimler announced that he wrote to everyone concerned .	-3.4326
If an inspection is due anyway , it will be done within its scope .	-2.4543
How long will the overall changes drag ?	-8.5074
" Hard to say " means Smetanin .	-1.7602
This depends on the commitment of manufacturers and on political pressure .	-2.1706
'Because we have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the issue of the environment to date ' .	-3.8240
How long should the update take ?	-1.4923
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-2.6428
Time can be more expensive to get an appointment .	-3.1038
What do drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.4966
The ACE advises you to wait .	-1.7761
Foreign manufacturers would probably follow , Smetanin said .	-2.8972
Does the price of Euro 4 cars now threaten to decline massi?	-4.0423
That is what the ACE fears .	-1.8136
But precisely in the regions where driving bans are threatening .	-3.0377
In rural areas , there has been no loss of value for older diesel .	-3.1544
The ACE advises to wait for a sale .	-1.9381
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center award	-1.1997
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-1.2520
President Trump ’ s first prize award promises to become political .	-1.7245
One of the winners will not come from protest .	-2.5013
LL Cool J ( 49 ) is the first rapper to receive one of the awards of the renowned Kennedy Center .	-3.1649
As the cultural institution announced on Thursday , this year singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) and the Choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and the TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) are among the honours . in the , the of , , , , ,	-7.0576
The awards will be passed in early December .	-2.5651
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will hold a reception and participate in the award together with his wife Melania .	-8.2315
The progressive TV series prize-winner Lear therefore already announced that he would not participate in the gala .	-9.8528
The New York Times said : ' This presidency has decided to completely neglect the arts and human rights - even to withdraw the resources - and that burdens me ' .	-4.8425
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasised that she will use the talk with Trump to clarify her vision .	-3.4761
The Kennedy Centre , named after former President John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.3371
Former winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks and Sting .	-1.7501
We Making the City Worth Li. of and .	-4.7685
Roland Wacker , Haslach ’ s city master , will be in pension next year .	-3.7156
The job is already in advance , but suitable candidates are rare .	-4.2004
Wacker has been a city master for 31 years .	-2.2609
And the work still gives him great fun in the press conversation .	-4.1985
He reports varied , but also demanding , tasks awaiting his successor .	-2.7770
At the same time , it is surprising that no application does not fulfil the requirement profile .	-15.5828
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the next possible time .	-2.7628
For example - in accordance with the regular termination periods - there is still enough time to process .	-9.9972
Since Haslach acts as the Lower Construction Rights Authority for the Administrative Community , the Applicant must provide appropriate qualifications .	-4.3660
Because this function definitely wants to keep the city .	-3.0510
If it were not able to fill it out , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for consultation .	-4.4797
But proximity to the city and to the city itself is important , says Wacker , who reports about a good operating climate and good mood between the authorities and the citizens .	-4.7660
In more than 30 years in office , several important projects have accumulated , with pride and pride in wackers .	-4.6667
" We make the city alive " , he is safe about the building office and its employees .	-4.4741
But there are also varied projects on the agenda : the former hukla area and the Niederhofenparkplatz have been restructured .	-5.0590
The Kinzigbrücke between Bollenbach and Steinach is renewed , and the stadium renovation is still a topic .	-3.5128
The latter alone will beat around EUR 1.5 million , " if we do it right " , Wacker estimates .	-3.9756
" All in all , fantastic tasks wait for my successor .	-9.6426
The work here is fun ' .	-10.4494
Designed for a master of the city there is large room for maneuver .	-9.3054
With Haslach 's own construction courtyard and gardenery , many things can be reacted quite flexibly .	-4.3774
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of green plants is often mentioned by citizens and visitors .	-3.7239
Because the Old Town as an ensemble is under monument protection , it is important to " have an eye for what is really right " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing city master emphasizes .	-6.1451
The master of the city without doubt bears a high responsibility .	-4.6377
He is Bauherr , " in the end everything runs over my table " .	-3.4050
In the case of care and coordination he can count on long-standing employees : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been involved for 10 years , Manfred Schöner ( Deep Construction ) for 15 years .	-5.0526
Wacker also wishes that his successor should stay long : " We are looking for someone who really wants to be identified and stay with the place " .	-5.4637
Continuity is important not only for a good working climate , but also for the further design of the city .	-3.2585
According to the city of Haslach , anyone who wishes to inherit Roland Wacker should be able to present a degree as a diploma engineer or a bachelor with specialised architecture and have good expertise in the fields of construction and construction law .	-6.4663
High and low construction , building construction planning , fundamental business affairs , management of urban properties , urban factory courtyard with building courtyard and city garden as well as underground construction , including monument protection .	-7.8870
Bicycles thrown on lines : South bank locked	-3.2166
According to the police , the perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from the railway transfer in the area of Leoben Street ( B116 ) onto the wires .	-4.3649
They were so damaged that the associated freight train had to be stopped .	-2.6859
The investigators are based on two male perpetrators and have been looking for them since night hours .	-3.2890
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver were observed near the town .	-3.8740
" This goes far beyond a bus cover , " said <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch to the APA .	-3.4796
The perpetrators would have put themselves in great danger , and would also have put train traffic at risk .	-4.0101
In addition to the damage to the location and the facility , as well as the late minutes and the cost of rail compensation , the perpetrators could also be panels of railway customers .	-6.4226
The speaker said that the total assumption should be a " significant " sum .	-5.2507
The damage was fixed on Friday afternoon , and rail transport on the southern track could be caused without disabilities .	-5.2646
Nearly ten passenger trains had been left on Friday morning , two of them concerned long-distance traffic .	-4.5235
Freight trains did not fell , but they were late . . . . . . . . . . . . . .	-13.8231
According to <unk>BB spokesman Christoph Posch , around 200 meters of pipelines had to be exchanged .	-3.0887
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.6832
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help relieve IBD ( inflammatory intestinal disease )	-2.3116
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.2577
But a new study claims exactly the opposite : a diet rich in meat-based proteins and dairy products could alleviate the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestinal diseas.	-2.4638
The incurable state , which affects around 1.3 million in the US and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach hearts and blues , recurrent or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-4.6383
While the stakeholders are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to alleviate their symptoms , researchers at Washington University found out that the essential amino acid contributes to the development of proteins ’ immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.2240
The senior researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immune cells patrol in the intestinal to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in eating do not enter the body .	-3.3722
Cells that can trigger inflammation are balanced by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without harming sensitive tissues . a . a . . a . . a .	-9.5134
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , it can result in inflammatory intestinal disease .	-3.0219
Experiments have found that a kind of tolerance-promoting immune cell occurs in mice that carry a particular bacterium in their infancy .	-4.6584
And the bacterium needs Tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-2.3682
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a connection between a type of bacteria - Lactobacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiom , and the development of a population of cells that promote tolerance .	-2.9484
The more tryptophans had the mice in their food , the more they had of these immune cells ' .	-2.6046
He suggested that the combination of L. reuteri and a nutrition rich in Tryptophan promotes more tolerant , less inflammatory intestinal milieu when the same system also works for humans .	-4.2160
The postdoctorate Dr. Luisa Cervantes-Barragan examined a kind of immune cell that promoted tolerance when she found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , which was housed separately , did not have it .	-3.7596
She suspected that the difference had to do with the intestinal biomes of the mice - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi usually living in the gastrointestinal tract .	-4.1268
The muscles were sequenced by DNA , and six types of bacteria were found that were present in mice with immune cells , but without them lacked in mice .	-4.7520
Mouses were raised in a sterile environment so that they lacked a darm-crobiom and did not develop this kind of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-4.6288
In order to understand how the bacteria affected the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grown in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of liquid - without the bacteria - to immature immune cells , which were isolated by the mice .	-4.1647
Immunicipal cells developed into tolerance-promoting cells .	-3.5194
When the active component was cleaned from the fluid , it proved to be a by-product of tryptophan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-3.3534
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in the mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when the tryptophan values were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-3.5851
Dr. Cervantes-Barragan declared that people have the same tolerance-promoting cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tracts .	-2.6378
It is not known whether Tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan were found in people with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-3.0882
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammations on the inner surface of the intestinal .	-2.8659
Potentially , high tryptophan values in the presence of L. reuteri may lead to an expansion of this population . '	-2.8570
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic	-1.8477
At Manchester United , Nemanja Matic signed a " genius " , Jose Mourinho believes after the middle field player had his debut against Sampdoria on Wednesday evening .	-3.6202
The 40 million pound signature of Chelsea began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the Holder Role , when people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira moved forward as they were .	-7.9750
However , Matic was excluded from the Blues ’ preparatory Asia tour , and managed only 45 minutes , admitting that he had to improve before the Premier League season began .	-4.0766
" He takes time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.7379
'We will help him to be prepared earlier than later ' .	-6.8183
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku started in the aviva stadium , when Mourinho formed his starting XI for the beginning of the season .	-3.4320
The Independent revealed this week that Mourinho wanted three more commitments , but insisted that the club had already done ' fantastic work ' to meet three of its four priority new commitments .	-3.8789
" Three of four to get , for which I thank the club , " he added .	-2.3714
'I will be happier when they get four out of four for me , but they have taken great effort ' .	-4.0650
Boeing Paints Dreamliner in the Sky	-1.9755
The US aircraft manufacturer Boeing has painted a Dreamliner 's silhouette in the sky .	-2.6200
The pilots flew from Seattle to the U.S. State of Washington , but the drawing began in Marquette in U.S. state Michigan and moved to the U.S. in the form of a dreamliner , several thousand kilometres .	-4.1110
The promotion lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.7374
On the radar screens were the form of a Dreamliner .	-2.8836
This was an endurance test for new engines .	-2.1028
Boeing had already made such advertising .	-1.5393
Thus , the number " 787 " and the Boeing logo was painted in the sky .	-9.3836
New Deployment for Martin Schulz - Hanover , we have a Problem	-5.4021
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was still SPD ’ s head , Socialist prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before elections .	-4.4677
Just no disruption fire from the party headquarters , no headwinds from the covenant - that was the most important wish of the electoral campaigners .	-5.1251
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-1.8669
Since then , employees from the Willy Brandt House have been growing horribly watching events in the SPD-ruled capitals .	-4.5158
What Schulz got from there since the beginning of the year would not be described with headwinds .	-2.9878
There were deep strikes .	-2.0792
That is one by one .	-1.5893
After the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions by SPD and Green .	-2.6531
" That once again shows : Rot-Green simply cannot govern reliably , " said CDU Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.9297
Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) has plunged the surprising group dispute of a Green MEP into a serious crisis .	-4.1540
Five months before the country election , his red and green coalition lost its one-vote majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-2.9423
The Green Federal Managing Director Michael Kellner has asked the breakaway Green MEP Elke Twesten to return her mandate .	-4.0535
Transferring to the CDU clearly distorts the voter 's will .	-2.8010
Elke Twesten must immediately return her mandate , " said the Federal Managing Director and Campaign Director of the Greens to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-3.3591
" All this must not be true " , an SPD campaigner sees when , on Friday morning , the new message reaches the party headquarters .	-4.9204
Stephan Weil , SPD Prime Minister of Lower Saxony , stands for the CDU without a majority of its own government after the transfer of the green Members Elke Twesten .	-4.9808
It is the provisional culmination of a whole range of major and small crises in SPD national associations .	-3.1060
No one knows what comes next .	-10.1287
The misery began with the unexpectedly clear defeat in the Saarland election in March .	-2.6494
A blue eye , no longer , the consonants calmed down at the time .	-4.1464
After the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia , everything will be different .	-2.4687
That also became - and everything became clearly worse .	-4.4075
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into tumbling , the Düsseldorf bankruptcy revived the party smoothly .	-4.7224
Over the weeks the cousins painfully reappeared .	-5.1158
Then , when they had just drawn up new courage , the Hamburg G-20 summit came .	-2.5101
And with him came the next depth .	-1.8884
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong SPD head of state , lost his nimbus at that weekend because he was in the Elbphilharmony while his city burned .	-3.4217
And because he then does quite a few things wrong in crisis communications .	-4.4746
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.9764
So now Stephan Weil , too .	-2.0114
The Netherlands Prime Minister has been criticising for a long time now because of the VW exhaust gas affinity and its role in the Supervisory Board .	-4.4585
Miese poll values were added .	-2.0295
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely for that reason , Because has tried to focus more and more on the covenant in recent weeks .	-5.3105
The effort of the former mayor of Hannover to strengthen his power in Berlin was not hidden either by connoisseurs around Martin Schulz .	-4.7126
They allowed him to be granted because they promised to stabilize the party .	-3.1364
Now the exact opposite may happen .	-11.3549
Because , in fact , is not to blame for the party internal dispute between the Lower Saxon Greens .	-4.2904
And Schulz does not .	-2.7279
For the time being , the colleagues are trying to keep their own rows closed .	-4.8587
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and especially at the breakaway parliamentarian , Twesten .	-3.7595
" It is intolerable and damaging to democracy , as Mrs Twesten puts her own interests in career over the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miersch , head of the party left in the SPD Group , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.7756
Mrs Twesten was elected to Parliament not because of her person as a direct candidate , but via the national list of the Netherlands Greens , so the Netherlands MEP continues .	-4.6799
The logical consequence would be that it returns its mandate .	-1.7459
Thomas Oppermann , head of the SPD Group , complains of an ' undemocratic manoeuvre ' .	-2.5597
" The will to vote four years ago was clear : people made Stephan Weil Prime Minister , " says Oppermann , who leads the Netherlands Society as the top candidate in the Bundestag , the RND .	-4.6240
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member distorts the election result , " Oppermann continued .	-4.0475
He called for the background to be cleared up .	-1.8570
I want to know whether there has been more or whether there have been further commitments from the CDU of Lower Saxony .	-3.1009
Support for local core III	-1.9757
Anyone who wants to refurbish his house in the years will soon be able to receive support from the country .	-5.5077
Mayor Albert Schindler and three representatives from STEG informed city development on Wednesday in Empingen .	-2.8038
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave a look at what has happened .	-3.3536
Since 1991 there have been reconstruction areas .	-3.1843
At that time , in the rehabilitation area I from 1991 to 2004 , the country Baden-Württemberg took over two thirds of the funding amoun.	-4.2762
After all , the grant was 60 % in the rehabilitation area II from 2005 to 2016 .	-3.4632
For children , the previous renovations are a " success project " - finally , it is important to promote internal development and not just to develop new building areas .	-5.8120
On 4 April , the Karlsruhe Government Bureau gave the information that there will be a rehabilitation area III .	-3.2678
The funding amount amounts to EUR 833 333 , of which 500 000 would come from the country , the rest of the municipality of Empingen .	-4.4011
How does a rehabilitation area arise ?	-3.2937
Schindler continues to investigate where the ' really old ' houses are .	-7.7143
It also plays a role , however , as to whether there is any interest in the planned area to renov.	-4.4880
If necessary , the territorial borders could then shift again .	-3.5178
The STEG represented Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel on Wednesday evening .	-1.6134
Keller presented the contents of the Federal Länder Programme " Social City " , in which the refurbishments would then be carried out .	-4.2935
The core of the programme is the revitalisation of domestic cities , improving housing and work relations and maintaining and expanding infrastructure .	-11.9948
The measures would be implemented object-related , i.e. per property .	-3.1936
The rehabilitation area would then finally be laid down as a statute .	-3.4257
The granting period for funding has been in progress since 1 January 2017 until 30 April 2026 .	-2.8999
However , until September of this year , the inventory would be carried out , in which those involved in the restoration area would receive a questionnaire to fill in .	-5.9085
In November or December , the Statutes decision will be taken as soon as possible so that the restructuring process can begin next year .	-5.3511
Pietzschmann then declared that each municipality must carry out the preliminary investigations .	-3.9455
It is a question of evaluating the urban maladministration and deciding when to repair and to what extent .	-4.3839
A recovery note will be added to the property for each property .	-4.7300
Pietzschmann will come again after reception and get a picture of the situation , she promised .	-3.8865
Gotzel emphasised that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .	-3.1627
Therefore there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed until the end of the summer holidays .	-4.1517
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and property arch " , which includes the construction state and the intentions for rehabilitation .	-5.6162
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing " , information can be made about the size , division and residents of a home .	-8.7867
The blue " arc " must be filled only if the building operates premises .	-5.1888
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a questionnaire filled out is not at the same time a request for funding .	-9.0656
Moreover , new construction measures are not eligible .	-2.0881
Schindler also emphasised that the distribution of funds according to the " greyhound principle " works - who comes first , brings first .	-5.1736
You cannot ' reserve funding for later on ' .	-2.7278
At the end , photos of the project " Ortskern II " were shown to make a refurbishment " tasty " for the present .	-5.1424
British inventors set themselves a microchip to get home and car with a hand movement	-4.0597
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office , and even start his car with a hand movement .	-3.9420
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their lives with technology by his company BioTeq .	-3.9370
He joined Dr. Geoff Watson , an advisory anaesthesist at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant procedure is carried out according to medical standards .	-3.1422
The technology resembles a cat and dogs implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-1.9728
The company of Mr. Northam also wants to change the castles of houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-3.4315
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is on the drive .	-3.8690
The White House ’ s Advertising Cost Taxpayers Thousands	-2.0023
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to the South Lawn for an event highlighted by American manufacturing last month costs taxpayers up to US $ 24,000 according to the military ’ s statements left to the TIME magazine .	-4.0741
The green and white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One , when the president is on board , was at the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.1328
President Donald Trump , Vice-President Mike Pence and White House senior officials made a tour of products from all 50 states .	-2.7240
The helicopter manufactured in Connecticut was exhibited next to a yacht made of maine , a fire brigade car from Wisconsin and a forklift truck from Mississippi .	-4.1192
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmentary order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on the South Lawn , according to the records of the Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for the operation of the helicopter .	-3.7714
" I just wanted you to be aware of this , because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " the commander of the HMX-1 wrote on the eve of the event of his superior , the deputy naval commander for aviation .	-3.8142
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 3 p.m. on 17 July , and until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-4.0936
The note adds that if departures from the White House were to be delayed , a second team would be needed for return flight because of the limitation of hours .	-10.1333
The original crew was at the helicopter during the event , while the unit 's safety personnel remained on the ground during the time .	-3.8441
The records made available by the TIME did not make it clear whether a second flight crew was ultimately ne.	-3.4292
The Hatch Act prohibits federal staff from using state ownership for political purposes .	-2.0798
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked whether the event could break the term .	-2.9207
" One question we asked was whether it was a violation of the Hatch Act and we were informed that this was not the case , " wrote the commander .	-2.9545
" Sound as if you are closed , " the deputy commander replied .	-2.9320
The " Made in America " event was described by the White House as an official event and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.7283
But official events also have political upper tones .	-1.6383
At the event , the President provided an impetus for the reform of health reform that was under way in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to contain government rules .	-9.3769
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One is hardly a new phenomenon for politically advantageous purposes .	-2.6215
Presidents are obliged to use them for the journey .	-2.2131
But requesting their use only for a photo OP is unusual .	-2.7129
Trump carried out an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft was in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of news complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by its predecessors .	-4.2111
" The White House is enthusiastic about the show " Made In America " - which shows products from all 50 states manufactured by American workers with American materials , " said the White House Deputy Secretary of the Press , Lindsay Walters .	-7.9804
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the region around Washington and South Lawn to deposit the US president in the White House with precise centimeter rates .	-4.3430
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 performed 58 exercise landings in the White House .	-2.5840
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted on the training needs of flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.2683
Helicopter units flew an additional 11 hours this day for " non-presidential support missions " .	-2.7074
The White House said that taxpayers did not pay the burden for any of the other requisites presented at the event .	-2.3717
A Speaker from Sikorsky said that the company had not been involved in exhibiting the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-2.7846
HMX-1 does not have presidential flights budget , and it is difficult to identify the exact cost of the event .	-3.6224
According to hour fares of the US Department of Defence for the financial year 2017 , however , the DoD refund rate for the VH-3D is USD 24,380 per flight hour .	-3.2542
Records of the unit record the aircraft flight time over 30 minutes from the home base of the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Vin Virgi.	-4.2583
The White House argues that the actual cost of operating the helicopter is far below that rate .	-2.2433
" Setting the cost to taxpayers on the basis of estimates for refund rates is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.4293
'These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds ' .	-2.8574
According to a 2015 RAND study , DoD ’ s reimbursement rates do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance and contract conclusion .	-3.6053
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the use of the helicopter for the event .	-2.6600
" The idea is to present things that are made in America this week , " Spicer said .	-2.2258
" I know that Sikorsky and the state of Connecticut are very proud that they contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands of people , are dependent on it .	-2.9326
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment , for which so many Americans have worked tirelessly .	-2.3699
It is of course appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.3580
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he entered his tour of the South Lawn for the event , but he was in the driver 's seat of a fire car .	-3.6098
In the White House , Trump spoke to representatives of Sikorsky and joked with the media on his own fleet of company products .	-2.3220
" I know Sikorsky very well , " said the President , " I have three of them . "	-2.0841

Top-runner of the Second Tennis-Bundesliga joins the Suchsdorfer SV table third .	-4.2669
TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will join Suchsdorfer SV tomorrow at 11 a.m. in Kiel .	-3.5700
Despite five games , the top runner of the Second Tennis League still has the meaning of reality .	-4.2685
In any case , team chairman Marius Zay respects the opponent .	-3.2717
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite similar formation .	-2.0367
It is precisely on the rear positions that I find the team very good . '	-3.1875
Class and stability at search village SV mainly provide imports from the north .	-4.5301
" Danes and Finns can even refer to bets in the Davis Cup .	-2.3949
And they are also strong in double , " says Zay with a view of Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerrehus ( all Denmark ) .	-2.9512
" As always , this will be difficult for us .	-9.1677
That is where you need good luck . '	-2.7704
The Neusser team for the trip to the high north is practical .	-2.9015
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janvier .	-2.0064

How America Can Damage OMV	-1.4789
Donald Trump really was not happy when he signed on Wednesday evening under the law to tighten up sanctions against Russia .	-3.4338
" In his haste to pass the law , " Congress packed a few " unconstitutional rules , " he would put it .	-4.5807
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was foaming against the US initiative .	-3.4297
After all , the draft provides for penalising European companies that help the Russians to build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.0875
Accordingly , since then , investors in domestic OMV have been worried that , together with other European companies , are cofinancing the construction of the Russian Baltic management Nord Stream 2 .	-5.0724
The threat scene is immense .	-1.2759
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil company .	-3.4011
Indeed , Donald Trump himself would have to bring sanctions to life by executive order .	-2.4108
Twelve weapons stand for him .	-2.0734
" The press " has looked at which of the Group could defend itself and which could really hurt him .	-8.4285
Narcos Square 3 Trailer : Without Pablo Escobar , the Cali Cartel will be put into the centre of the Netflix Hitseries	-10.0500

'The offer also applies to 35-hour care when children stay until 14 p.m. '	-3.6275
From September 1 , 46 part-time staff have kitchen service : they heat up the dishes supplied , complement them with salad , raw material and fruit , portion the meal individually , spend the meal , clean up , wash and clean the kitchen .	-6.1651
" Employees are firmly assigned to a kita , " says Pomerance .	-3.4783
The size - there are two groups as well as seven groups - decides on the scope of the hour .	-3.2635
" The kitchen helpers now firmly belong to the Kita team , " says Pomeranz satisfied .	-3.8423
" They are much more involved and it is easier to implement pedagogical concepts for kitalization " .	-3.3688
It is also a question of healthy diets and cooking lessons .	-2.6805
" The children should help prepare food " .	-2.4868
The direct connection of the kitchen to the team makes sense .	-2.7094
For the children , too .	-3.1758
" They have a known power in the kita , a person who is familiar with them and not constantly changing people " .	-3.5605
This continuity is important for children .	-1.2935
The cleaning of the Kita rooms - so far also the kitchen forces - will be done by special cleaning staff .	-4.8199

The League 's side may regret her interest in Marco Verratti	-2.5346
Paris Saint-Germain will not relax in her persecution of Neymar after having issued an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger his release clause , but did they warn Barcelona three years ago before the world record attack ?	-3.4242

The police are now asking witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter pays vehicle to contact the Commissioner in Stolzenau under tel 05761 / 92060 .	-3.1764
Interview : ' Domspatzen report relieves Papst brother Georg Ratzinger '	-2.0787
The Regensburger Domspatzen report on cases of abuse relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger .	-2.5626
This is the meaning of author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-2.4237
The final report on the abuse scandal in Regensburger Domspatzen continues to provide discussions .	-3.4140
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the Reform Movement " We are Church " , declared an apology by the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller and by the Domkapellmaster Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emergent Pope Benedict XVI .	-4.5006
It would serve the prestige of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their then false assessment of what happened .	-4.6711
On the other hand , the Vatican newspaper " Osservatore Romano " criticized that " double standards " would be measured in reporting about violence in domestic pats .	-4.3132
As far as the attacks in Regensburg are concerned , nobody doubts that they are " shameful and shameful acts " which should be punished and prevented in the future ; but the " degree of media manipulation " , according to the author Lucetta Scaraffia , historian and member of the National Italian Bioethics Committee .	-4.6748
" The habit of describing the Catholic Church as a source of all evil is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider it normal , " says Scaraffia .	-3.8037
Fürstin Gloria von Thurn and Taxis also mentioned in the interview with the Bavarian broadcasting : " You like to go to the church and that is a found meal " .	-5.2927
Moreover , she pointed out that in her youth " beats were a normal educational means " to cope with cheerful children , as I was one , " .	-4.9801
They would find it unfair to apply today ’ s standards to earlier decades , because the world has changed .	-2.4299
In connection with the reports on cases of abuse , Pope Brothers Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-3.7661
Author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the memorial band " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) with advice .	-4.8473
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him , " he values the results of the final .	-3.5369
What exactly is the 440-page report presented by the lawyer , appointed by the Bistum Regensburg with the Enlightenment , Ulrich Weber ?	-3.1425
A total of 547 Regensburger dompats were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of attacks , 67 domspats .	-4.0210
In the final report , Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg between 1964 and 1994 , states : " In summary , it is clear that in many cases , forms of physical and mental violence have been applied by Domkapellmeister R.	-7.5894
Especially at high emotionality , punishment for students could also be more violent .	-4.5134
Nevertheless , contrary to many other accused , many victims appreciate the general humanity of R. R. and therefore , in many cases , even connect positive memories with him , despite violence . "	-13.8294
In the interview , Hesemann explains why the final report on the abuse scandal of the Regensburger Domspatzen Georg Ratzinger seems to be relieving his opinion .	-4.0914
Mr Hesemann , the 440-page report on the ' incidents of violence in protective defences at Regensburger Domspatzen ' gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-4.7820
On the one hand , many students highlight his " humanity " .	-2.8829
On the other hand , it also appears as a cholerist and perfectionist who has often become handy when a domspatz has not brought top performance .	-5.5374
How do you , as his biographer , consider this final report ?	-2.0053
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440-page report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is actually there . . . the . . . . . . . . . . .	-13.7093
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and is clearly released from any suspicion of complicity or cooperation in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-3.8596
The pre-school violence also occurred outside its sphere of effect .	-3.1317
At best we can accuse him of being too late or not having taken seriously enough initial suggestions .	-4.4896
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was perceived by virtually everyone as " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-4.4728
Thus , the vast majority of his students Georg Ratzinger issues an excellent testimony , describes him as " warm-hearted " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " understanding " , as an extremely good teacher who regularly supplied the guys with cakes , biscuits and candies and " always surrounded by grapes of children " .	-5.3705
Only a minority complains about its perfectionism and its high emotionality , which led to anger .	-3.6361
The fact that he did not only call with stools and threw the key confederation on the ground , but also distributed ear figs and pulled too friendly boys on the hair or ears , he himself admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized .	-7.2101
However , to his rescue of honour , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960s and 1970s , in parents as in teachers .	-4.4220
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-2.2082
Of course , I think each of us born before 1968 .	-1.8727
I too witnessed this in a secular school , a state symnasium .	-7.8442
Compared to what this report is actually about , namely the appalling sexual abuse and pre-school violence , these are , of course , bagatelles .	-4.1361
One wonders whether it is more likely to deal with his fame and role as brother of Benedict XVI , that many media have just plunged him .	-11.5451
Many people who have never understood him are still eagerly working on the Bavarian Pope .	-3.4991
The truth is , however , that the report discharges Georg Ratzinger in every respect !	-7.7908
Much has been said in the media about the issue of abuse of the Regensburger Pats in the context of the report .	-4.5637
Will Georg Ratzinger be charged with any involvement or co-knowledge in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.4234
Michael Hesemann : clearly no .	-1.6554
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assaults claims to have entrusted themselves to the Domkapellma.	-2.6970
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.4660
" I have never dared to talk about it with my father or mother , " one person involved said , " It was all very embarrassing " .	-5.2713
The real problem with educating sexual abuse was and is that most victims are silent from shame .	-3.3147
If they did not even entrust parents and sisters to themselves , then they certainly do not have a choral leader who would have been a professional colleague of perpetrators .	-5.1102
How do domestic students assess the role of council zinger in the case of abuse ?	-5.6481
Michael Hesemann : A surveyed student put it as follows : " With regard to sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) could have had timely insights and could have stopped the perpetrator .	-5.2768
I think it is ... also really absurd to think that he calculates ... Jacks of strong or clearer or even more have opened up than towards their parents , boarding directors , trust teachers etc .	-6.5377
That he talks about sex ... - unthinkable . '	-2.7681
Thus , the report comes to the very clear conclusion : ' The fact that students affected in advance and / or their environment could not be confirmed in the context of the investigation ' .	-5.6635
As far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger must be free from any co-knowledge .	-4.0730
Nor can he be accused of not having prevented or displayed him .	-9.2745
There is therefore no reason to link his good name to these unfortunate crimes , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-3.0916
In the media there was a lot to read about " violence " at the Regensburger Domspatze .	-5.0071
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused of in the Wegschauen report .	-3.2097
Should he live with this accusation ?	-2.0229
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything was mixed in the reporting and mixed up into a huge melange of sexual abuse and violence and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.2291
However , that is precisely what the report is abusing .	-4.3191
There is a clear separation : between the pre-school and the symnasium of dome pats , between sexual abuse and excesses of violence and , let us say , other accusations .	-5.3638
Furthermore , the report deals with incidents from the period since 1945 , in other words also from four decades when Georg Ratzinger was not choral leader of domestic pats .	-4.8742
The whole terrible beating education , the cases in which sadistic teachers ' boys were really harassed and maltreated and suffered appallingly , took place at the pre-school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions had to prevail .	-5.9717
Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , because he only got the boys to face when they were already at the Dompatzengymnasium .	-5.6104
On that , as the vast majority of witnesses emphasize , the subject " preschool " was taboo .	-3.4428
One was happy to escape her and enjoyed so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-3.0719
What was different from the domestic gymnasium ?	-3.7046
Michael Hesemann : Although there was discipline , there was no sadistic violence .	-2.3799
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that " many victims value the general humanity of R. R. and therefore , in many cases , even combine positive memories with him , despite violence . "	-4.7368
That is the maximum accusation of having turned a blind eye .	-10.2926
However , despite all the efforts , the report has only been able to define two periods when it has been reported to the pre-school conditions .	-4.5475
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he began to establish itself and from what happened at a school where he did not work and was responsible , ( so the witness ) did not want to hear anything , and then again around 1993 .	-5.6136
Did Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the states ?	-2.6101
Michael Hesemann : No , since in 1989 he wrote a letter to the Director of the Domplatzengymnasium , which the report even reproduces .	-3.3297
He points out to them that the caning sentence will continue in pre-school .	-5.0684
In view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-7.9953
That was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity , when ruling sentences were long banned in Bavaria .	-4.2985
Before that they occurred in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-6.9726
It was difficult for him , too , to estimate where the stakeholders might be excessive or dramatised and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded .	-8.9692
But it cannot be said that he always looked away .	-11.3662
That is simply not true .	-0.9509
Only in 1980 was the official abolition of the caning sentence at schools in Bavaria .	-8.8940
Principal Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it was unfair to apply today ’ s educational standards to that time .	-3.5661
How do you see that ?	-1.1213
Michael Hesemann : We historians are talking about the ' case strick of anachronism ' , in other words the danger of assessing past according to moral st. , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.9274
The Prince is right .	-1.8041
But that does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was horrific at all times , nor to what was broken in the pre-school of resistance and violence in innocent souls of children , which goes far beyond the usual one .	-5.9179
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked on .	-3.3184
But at the same time I must protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.7630
His means of disciplining and punishing , in other words , ear figs and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-3.9267
When physical punishment was banned , he also strictly adhered to it .	-2.8047
What image of his Regensburg time has Georg Ratzinger reflected in the talks with you for the book " My Brother of the Pope " ?	-3.4460
Has the issue of caning been raised ?	-3.5274
Michael Hesemann : Well , the book is about the life of his brother Joseph , that is , Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , as the domains played only one side .	-4.9592
Nevertheless , I fail to remain silent that he had a strict regime .	-4.1804
But that , too , must be said : without this perfectionism , without demanding unconditional discipline , it would hardly have been possible for him to shape a worldwide institution from the rather nationally known Regensburg domains , real cultural ambassadors of Europe and its musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-6.2758
With biscuits and bonbons alone , one doesn 't make big singers and stand before every success , no matter what territory , but always discipline , passion and self-overcome . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.0685
What kind of person did you experience Georg Ratzinger during the talks on her book ?	-3.3759
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I have met Georg Ratzinger quite well and repeatedly as wonderful , humorous , fundamental , deeply believed and heartfelt people , who cannot be imagined that he could do something about a fly .	-6.8118
I receive regular contact with him regularly , visit him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family , 23 years after his emeritation .	-4.5698
Those who , to date , do not forgive him for being strict with them , are therefore clearly in the minority .	-4.2231
Most domains are grateful to him today for enriching their lives and bringing the world of music to them .	-3.3384
And that he was always a good , paternal teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but also a loving respect to which they are still looking today and worshipping them .	-5.3783
And please be clear once again : everything accused of him are educational methods that were then on the agenda .	-4.7301
We can be glad that we have long overcome this time .	-2.0102
But it is highly unfair to make a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to make himself a media scapegoat .	-2.8113
The evil intention behind it is all too obvious .	-2.3417
Because the report that has just been published relieves it .	-7.4089
Now it would be decent to have a 93-year-old man who has earned a great deal of merit and who , without the outside of Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , would no one know the Regensburg cathedrals finally to let peace .	-6.8856
