Gutach : Even more pedestrian safety	-2.2927
They are not 100 metres apart : on Tuesday the new B 33-footer ramp was put into operation at the village park - in sight of the older Town Hall ramp .	-8.1817
Two plants so close by : Will or Schild ?	-5.0966
Gutach ’ s mayors clearly answered that question yesterday .	-2.2413
" The Town Hall Temple was installed at that time because it was the school way , " explained Eckert yesterday .	-5.9979
The Kluber traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus drivers and mountain residents .	-4.5140
The facility officially opened yesterday is important for the cruise area Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-4.4752
We have the museum , two churches , spa park , bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the traffic flow from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-3.1375
" At the high traffic and pedestrian pay there was another traffic light for their safety " , says Eckert .	-5.5371
Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Board also confirms this .	-3.7889
" According to current measurements , about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 daily , of which about ten percent are heavy traffic , " says Arnold .	-5.0421
So it is more than necessary to build another ampel : " Safety is just going on here " , says Arnold .	-6.0733
Four traffic shows were carried out , and a traffic circle was thought up , however , due to the closeness in the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e area .	-7.3635
It was first tested by Arnold when choosing the location of the traffic light masts : " By means of an extra truck loading us with particularly long wooden trunks , we have evaluated whether these vehicles can drive out from the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without reloading the ampel masts " .	-15.9755
The EUR 15 000 traffic light plant itself is ' the most modern which is currently on the market ' , explained Arnold .	-5.7118
The complex is equipped with colour LEDs that light up so that the lights of the drivers , for example , are well visible even in low-running sun .	-8.6734
It is also economical : the older light systems use about 100 watts , the new one just eight watts .	-4.2111
There are three lighting systems available per direction .	-3.3182
Arnold explained the technique of the new facility : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.2012
Once the pedestrian presses the button above the traffic light , the upper radar sensor tests traffic .	-7.6190
If the road is free , immediately green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-2.7948
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be stopped .	-3.5284
" If a group or disabled people go out of the road , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will come safely across the road , " explained Arnold .	-6.1076
Of course , the driver should think as a partner here and watch the driving track .	-5.2581
This was not the case yesterday : the traffic lights for pedestrians showed green , robbed a class vehicle - with bright red .	-5.7904
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years the needs of his childhood and youth from the soul .	-3.2595
The Carinthian poet has often described the disasters of his Catholic village kinship - the speechlessness , the slope to raw violence and blunt sexuality , the closeness and helplessness .	-6.4131
In his work , the bookmaker prize-winner is known primarily as a proauthor .	-8.5790
Collage from Prosatextensive Gerhard Fresacher presents for his performance " Wetter Wetter auf der Zungenspitze " , which can now be seen in Garage X am Peterplatz , hence a collage of Prosatextensive .	-7.3828
The theatre maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographical novel " Der Leibeigen " ( 1987 ) with prosaminists from " corpse , his family besieged " ( 2003 ) .	-6.4624
The stage , which is largely empty , is an important acquisition : a cracked sofa , where where the listener is copied and majorically mapped , is linked by the text material .	-12.6868
Yet director Freacher does not seem to trust the text .	-2.9150
The 70-minute performance outweighs the presentation with a wealth of register influences , known from the repertoire of postdramatic forms of play .	-4.8383
In particular , the actors come up with some dubious scenic exercises .	-6.4777
They are dressed hard , with their heads flowing under water , wrapped with their nightmares to the wall .	-5.8637
Inquated in Cellophan or Mieder , they stacked on dangerously high sticks through the staging , either monologize them loud or lie completely dammed on the stage floor .	-7.3301
The text , however , is hardly mediated in this way .	-4.2259
The best moments have the evening when sung - the band ranges from Deep Purple to the folk song .	-5.1618
Only towards the end will the superlated performance come to rest , and Winkler becomes immediately fanciful of absurd humor .	-8.0486
A black box in the car ?	-1.2026
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the declining Highway system , and believe that they have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in each car 's armature board .	-5.8697
The devices that record every kilometre of traffic and report the information to the authorities are at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and the state planning offices to revise the obsolete system for financing American roads .	-5.0253
The area of road planning , which is usually boring , has suddenly stirred up an intensive debate with coloured .	-5.1124
Libertarians have allied themselves with environmental groups and argue that the government can use the small boxes to record the kilometres that have been driven – and possibly where they have been driven – and then use the information to calculate tax modest .	-6.9169
The Tea Party is appalling .	-1.4146
The American Association of Citizens ' Rights ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and expresses a number of data protection concerns . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.4571
But , while Congress cannot agree to take action , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.6560
They are currently considering how to change over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-4.2470
Thousands of motorists have already tested the tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.9996
This is really a must for our country .	-1.9081
“ It is nothing we will only possibly use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn of Government , who plans to record the miles flown in all California drivers in the state from 2025 .	-5.2738
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.6656
The technology is there .	-1.5900
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , which is financed from taxes that US Americans pay at the Zapping Column , is broke .	-4.7121
But America no longer holds as much ground as it used to .	-3.4930
Cars consume less fuel .	-1.8407
The state oil tax of 18.4 cents per gallone ( less than 4 euro cents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.1008
Politicians at high fuel prices do not dare to raise the tax even by one cent .	-2.6222
“ The fuel tax is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on traffic legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.3426
Its federal state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a mile-based payment system .	-4.4212
“ That is the most sensible alternative in the long term , ” he said .	-2.4392
Bureaucrats call it a miles based user fee .	-3.1446
It is not surprising that urban liberals find the idea positive , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way as to reduce congestion and climate-damaging exhaust emissions .	-5.7654
Californian planners rely on the system to develop strategies to achieve the ambitious , legally established objectives of the federal state on climate change .	-4.8125
But the Republican Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , has also stated that it is the most viable long-term alternative .	-4.5083
The Reason Foundation 's free marketers are also inspired by the idea of allowing drivers to pay back .	-5.0914
“ This is not a tax that disappears into a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice President for Reason Guidelines .	-3.3003
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.1576
The movement is also supported by two former US transport ministers who , in a 2011 report , called on Congress to move toward supply-based reckoning .	-4.4896
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project that would have covered 10,000 cars .	-2.2985
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the move , responding to the concerns of MEPs from rural areas , representing people who often have to spend many miles on the road to work or to the city in everyday life .	-6.4118
Nevertheless , several states and cities are moving in that direction on their own .	-4.9418
Oregon is the most committed driver of the country ’ s largest experiment .	-6.2370
These drivers will soon pay the mileage instead of the mineral oil tax to the federal state .	-3.0113
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-1.0762
New York City is also considering such a thing .	-2.1196
Illinois tests it for a limited extent with trucks .	-3.9675
And the I-95-coalition , which includes 17 states on the east coast of transport ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia , and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the change .	-4.0144
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.6737
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers recently were equipped with the equipment , drivers were sceptical about the government ’ s ability to pursue any of its movements .	-4.4189
“ Concerns against Big Brother and such things were a major problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Results Management in Nevada ’ s Ministry of Transport .	-4.1728
People did not want it .	-1.0839
When the test started , Nevada ’ s ACLU warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to turn the tachograph into full monitoring devices . ”	-4.5705
There is no need to build a giant , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-3.4090
Nevada is one of a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology that allows the state to capture the miles , but not exactly when and where .	-5.0877
So , Khan , the public would also be more reassured .	-3.2528
The pursuit of this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.2270
The company did not originally come to help states with the taxation of drivers .	-4.8537
In fact , it was their aim to find a market for car insurance in which drivers are to pay on the basis of the miles they have been driven .	-7.8120
However , the devices it tests are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide limited information that is regularly uploaded via modem .	-5.3533
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and location are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-2.8305
Some of these public pilot programmes have made great mistakes .	-3.8360
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-2.3747
In Oregon , the planners are experimenting with giving drivers a number of choices .	-2.7536
You can choose a device with or without a GPS .	-1.5822
Or they choose no device at all , and instead pay a lump-sum fee based on the average miles flown by all residents of the state .	-4.9620
Other bodies hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by providing the devices with more functions than those of others .	-4.2934
In New York City , transport officials want to develop a means of taxation that can also pay parking fees , pay insurance for driven miles , and raise speed data from other vehicles in real time , enabling drivers to avoid congestion .	-6.9504
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the advantages offered by the system , ” it is said in a city planning document .	-4.2552
However , some road planners wonder whether the talk of paying per mile is not just a huge diversion .	-4.9283
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the San Francisco Bay area officials said that Congress could simply solve the problem of the bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by increasing fuel tax .	-3.6722
An additional one-off charge or an annual tax could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that consume little fuel , so that they too pay a fair share .	-4.8753
‘ There is no reason for an operation if an asphalt is sufficient ’ , says Randy Rentner , the Commission ’ s head of legislation and public affairs .	-5.3530
If we do , hundreds of millions of drivers are making their privacy and many other things happen .	-3.4117
Königsfeld : Kleine Team stumps into wacker	-4.7116
The volunteer fire brigade carried out its autumn main test despite its lack of personnel with bravura .	-5.4732
Only 11 men took part in the exercise .	-1.3550
In his training he had selected Hans Kammerer as Deputy Chairman of the Board of Appeals in the Burgberger Stra<unk>e .	-6.0867
A short break was made there during the sawing process .	-5.3103
Two people were injured by the fire and smoke that caused it , but one of them was still able to send an emergency call .	-5.7646
After the first review of the facts , two military commanders of the Wehrmacht agreed to enter the building .	-5.1164
After a short time it was possible to find the first person and to guide the outside .	-5.1415
The second person had to be borne .	-1.9522
This was not so easy since a narrow staircase was also to be overcome .	-3.8731
The building , a workshop with integrated housing for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.3885
It stored a lot of wood and also straw balls in it .	-3.4448
In addition , there were electric machines for wood processing .	-3.2084
The first extinguishing handle was performed via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.7672
Another line was carried out over an overflur-hydrante at about 100 meters away .	-6.8804
Three extinguishing handles were now possible .	-2.7465
A hollow tube was used in the building .	-3.4899
Hans Kammerer also took the course to show what is to be done with few staff available .	-5.9239
In the worst case , support is provided via the Königsfeld daily intervention group .	-4.0444
The commander was satisfied with the sequence of the exercise .	-1.8953
Interlinking universities and businesses	-1.9980
During his visit to the Breisgau High Black Forest , President Guido Wolf also told Titise Neustadt where the workforce of tomorrow came from .	-6.0145
At the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum , he went into this important issue together with the leading school teachers of the Appellal School , as well as the county college and the chief of parents .	-8.4656
" Education is an important location factor , " emphasized Claudia Stahle , director of the Hans-Thoma-Schule , who presented the networked school project " Bildungszentrum " .	-8.2566
Wolf was impressed by the educational model projects .	-2.7228
Since 2011 , there has been a successful collaboration in the rolling city between the promotion centre , the district gymnasium and the vocational school centre .	-5.6234
He also praised the family friendliness in the district .	-3.2041
" It is important not only to have a look at the family phase , but also because of demographic change the phase of caring for relatives , " explained Wolf .	-4.4909
He also said that more and more staff were paid for the care and care of their relatives .	-4.9418
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to employment " , Wolf said .	-4.4101
But no one can afford to lose a skilled workforce , he continued .	-2.1687
Another particularly important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-3.1479
" For anyone who has experienced the benefits of the region during his studies often remains the regional economy with his acquired knowledge and skills , which helps to strengthen the region , " the country president was convinced .	-7.2287
Only if there were enough training places available could skilled workers be covered .	-4.3508
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its ideal location in the southwest of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-3.4473
In addition , on his journey from Titise-Neustadt to Freiburg , he witnessed the efforts already made for the development of local public transport .	-5.3905
" If you continue to stay stubbornly and ensure that public transport is better , " he explained to the local politicians present .	-7.7422
Experience an entertaining afternoon with Music	-2.2474
The Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors for 15 years for coffee , cakes and afterwards for a vesper .	-4.8985
In the past , the elderly had been fed in the breeding ground .	-4.9554
In the meantime , this afternoon is taking place at the Pflanzenheim St. Josef .	-5.8223
The locals loved the delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.7414
Later , cold salt was used .	-4.2707
With popular melodies , Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich continued .	-4.7490
The over 100 years old natural stone wall as the front demarcation of the old school courtyard to the Kirchstra<unk>e , which is situated in front of the refurbishment , is to be re-set on the reconstruction cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-9.4334
In the days before the Kilbig , a small angular wall , for stabilization and static discharge of the natural stone wall with Balustrade , was built in the first works of the reconstruction of the front school courtyard .	-6.7248
The next step is to include the town ’ s town council , Alexander Misok , and to set up a reconstruction concept for the old wall .	-8.9173
A cost calculation will then be carried out by experts who will then be put on the table to the Council of Communists to decide and determine how to proceed .	-6.0087
A decision on this is expected to be taken next year .	-2.7420
After the renovation , pavement and construction of the old school courtyard within the two sides of the school 's wing in 1912 , the reconstruction walls of the school must be reconstructed from scratch and placed on new foundations in the foreseeable future .	-8.0447
The historic wall of the old school ’ s wall to the church wall , which is one hundred years old , is above all due to water and frost damage , since there is no drainage , need to be repaired and has an archery inclination ahead .	-8.4555
Deep cracks in individual stones bear witness to the damage caused by the weather , but the wall is currently not .	-5.8811
A sturdy wall is a prerequisite for a student using Schulhof , which has been done through the current fixing work .	-6.6977
Originally , the school renovation was planned even in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure caused a shift .	-4.6809
One important word in the historical school mouse animation , which has even been used for film shots , will be the National Heritage Office .	-6.1222
If you have any questions , don 't hesitate to contact us .	-4.6996
The students of the Brüninger primary school , who are now taught again in a well-renovated old school building with new Aula , can soon use the old school courtyard .	-6.6978
<unk>zdemir wants to gain jazz training in Stuttgart	-2.0149
Cem <unk>zdemir , Chairman of the Greens , has now joined in the ongoing discussions on the future of music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.3760
" I think it is wrong to give up holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart " , said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart news " .	-4.1159
Jazz and classical music belong just at the jazz site Stuttgart .	-3.9908
In this way , <unk>zdemir , who is considered to be a favourite for a direct mandate at the German election on 22 September , contradicts the Green Red Landesregierung .	-6.9344
On the basis of an expert study , this is forcing a reorganization of the five music schools in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.5388
In addition , the study programme Jazz and Pop is to be transferred from the Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule Mannheim .	-5.2782
U.S. border : Super-Tunnel discovered to smuggling drugs	-3.6304
At the border between Mexico and the US , investigators have discovered and shut down a ' super tunnel ' for drug smuggling .	-3.2362
As the US customs authorities said , the tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railway tracks , and a ventilation system for more than 500 meters .	-4.3226
Three suspects were therefore arrested , eight tonnes of marijuana and nearly 150 kilograms of cocaine were seized .	-2.3938
According to the data , the tunnel has not yet been used .	-2.3161
" This cartel is stupid if they think they could get stuck under the radar , " said the Attorney General of the US District Southern California , Laura Duffy , at a press conference in front of a San Diego warehouse , where an end to the tunnel had been discovered .	-5.2496
Duffy contacted drug gangs : " If you continue building such a tunnel and trying to use it , we are determined to make your dirty money a huge waste . "	-5.5844
Both the US authorities and the Mexican security forces are in constant fighting against the drugs cartels .	-3.0425
Since 2006 , more than 7 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug-related crime .	-2.4501
Constructed by experts	-1.1055
Due to the complex equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and took up the construction for about a year .	-5.0034
The track system was equipped to use electric cars .	-4.1481
On the Mexican side , access is in a building 80 meters from the border .	-3.1027
According to the authorities , a ladder takes 20 meters deep to the actual tunnel entrance .	-4.2076
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters height and 90 centimeters width .	-2.9479
It would also have been appropriate to encourage illegal immigration towards the USA .	-3.7346
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine freeze .	-2.1914
The third , a Mexican , was seized because of the seized Marihuanas .	-3.2192
All three , as officials said , are threatened with the ultimate sentence of life imprisonment .	-4.5815
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , and the press conference in San Diego continued .	-2.9948
It is , however , the first time that such a Tunnel Bay has been found .	-3.8854
Normally cocaine is smuggled into smaller quantities rather than tunnels .	-2.6840
This shows the " desperation " of the drug gangs , whose traditional routes are now cut off , said Bill Sherman of the DEA drug formulation in San Diego .	-4.1687
They would do everything to reach the US .	-2.1656
No details were given to those arrested , at least one was Mexicans .	-3.0344
They have to expect prison sentences of up to ten years .	-4.2986
In 2014 , Geisinger Fest	-4.4395
The anniversary of the city of violas on the 1250 .	-5.1823
The return of the first historical mention is approaching .	-4.7381
When the year ends in a good eight weeks , the anniversary year stands .	-4.1308
Geising and church houses were first mentioned together in 794 , for the first .	-4.2334
A certificate was produced in churches where both places are mentioned .	-4.0077
On the 15th of March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and as violonsinging currently has no hall , this event will take place in the place where , 1250 years ago , both were mentioned for the first time , in church houses .	-7.6676
In the course of the anniversary several events are planned both in violas and in church houses .	-4.9672
In July , the church house will be the 1250 festival weekend from 18 to 20 July .	-5.4382
To celebrate Returning .	-4.9287
On Friday with a celebration , on Saturday and Sunday with a party around the church hall .	-3.7086
At this festive weekend there is also the church festival .	-4.5124
The city ’ s music director Rudolf Barth wrote a contract composition for the city on the occasion of the jubilee , which is performed on three dates .	-6.0423
On June 21st together with the sunbath party of the Black Forest Association , on July 12th in the Arena with fireworks and on December 13th the first concert of the city music in the new Festhalle .	-5.2326
This will be completed and inaugurated in the jubilee year , the official date is on the last September weekend , on 27 and 28 September .	-4.4324
On the occasion of the celebration of the town , a new chronicle is also being released .	-4.5267
" But a chronicle should not only be made by violins themselves , but rather a printed work about the singing of today , which is made up of violins , churches , Leipzig , Aulfingen and GutMaking , " said Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-8.5026
And today ’ s vultures celebrating 2014 ’ s birthday , in 1974 today ’ s room was filled with ideas .	-8.2239
The new chronicle will be presented on November 21st or 22nd in the new Festhalle in Geisingen .	-3.7914
But 2014 is another year with many anniversaries .	-2.3136
The Narrenzuft Strohglonki starts on February 8 with a traditional evening on the occasion of its 60-year anniversary , the harmony of GutMaking is 90 years and has the banquet on March 29 and then celebrates the district music festival from May 1st to 4th .	-7.0764
The Altenwerk Leipzig is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been in the new location for 50 years and is celebrating this on May 10 , the Musikverein Polyhymnia Leipzig will be 150 years old and will celebrate this in the Brunnenfest from July 4 to 7 .	-6.4893
The town of Geising was first mentioned in the year 764 in a museum owned by St. Gallen .	-5.2805
The certificate was built in churches ( houses ) , which was then the place of jurisdiction .	-4.2603
Both communities are thus mentioned in the same document .	-2.1157
The reason to celebrate this 1250 year in 2014 is also that the local reform dates back 40 years .	-4.9942
The Council is targeting the rail industry	-3.8057
Should the train crossing " Am Hirschen " be completely rebuilt in order to improve road safety ?	-5.3662
Yes , the local councils have decided .	-2.5189
That has to be given EUR 220 000 .	-3.7676
Deutsche Bahn intends to improve the Kinzigtal route next year .	-4.0993
In particular , the safety of railways is to be increased - regular trains are arriving throughout Germany with other vehicles .	-8.2810
If the communities vote for the reconstruction , they must participate with a third of the cost , the rest share the federal and federal government .	-7.5974
Schiltach Stadtbaumeister Roland Griesler explained to the council the specificity of the Bahüberfahrung " Am Hirschen " .	-6.9896
There , the city plans to build an excursion to the west of the railway at the height of the local tunnel world .	-4.8627
There , even larger vehicles , such as those carrying Langwood , could stand for counter traffic without having to block the track .	-5.9623
For this reason , Greek holders proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road in due course in order to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-5.9857
This was controversial in the Municipal Council , as some councils questioned the need for road distribution : Thomas Kipp , in his statement , put the mood of critics at the point : " Do we have to take so much money in our hands for so few vehicles ? "	-8.1560
Mayor Thomas Haas said : The train passage " Hirschen " is regularly used for the transportation of timber .	-4.7905
Even wood from the area " Kuhbach " is partly transported via this route because the up to 20 metres long vehicles could not use the route at the Häberlesbridge because they could not turn into the main road there .	-5.6050
Moreover , the route serves as a transit for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , Haas argued .	-3.7744
It should be noted that Kirchberg and Castle Tunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated , as is currently the case in Wolfach , that the passage of the train " Hirschen " could also have an important transport significance for a long period of time .	-8.1861
The councils agreed to let them examine what costs would cause the intended extension of the road .	-5.2562
Despite this , the majority of the reconstruction of the rail transit was agreed with the stipulation that the required support wall is built in such a way that the city could possibly expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " for the provision of a bus call to around 5.5 metres .	-10.4024
However , the reconstruction of the train crossing at the Trautwein Museum could pose a quite different problem , which concerns the entry into the heavily rising " Geroltzhäuser Weg " .	-9.0019
The administration had asked the railway reconstruction plans to be examined by the engineer ’ s office , Breinlinger , as she had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Wegs was possible without further ado .	-8.9302
The investigation came to the conclusion that it was not to be ruled out that the road 's jealousy could lead to longer cars being put on the ground .	-7.6021
The responsibility for this lies with the city as a road paver .	-3.7561
The reconstruction could therefore lead to liability disputes .	-3.9865
Haas argued that the construction of the railway was not acceptable , as both the logging and the turning of the railway was in operation at present .	-10.3869
Also , the risk of a collision of the turn with a vehicle on the transition is significantly less than that of the other trains , because the center stop is located right next to the center , to which a good viewing link exists .	-10.1610
Even trains from the main railway station should have been stopped there so far that no collision would be threatened .	-5.4446
The majority of people refused to accept the reconstruction of this railway crossing because the town of Schiltach had to " cover up " the problem with suspension vehicles , so the bikes as could withdraw from after completion .	-9.8300
As unproblematic , the panel considers the modifications to the railway entrances " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which the railway had already been completed by means of the cruise agreements .	-9.8098
Esa decides on large space missions : missions for billions	-2.5545
distant planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to launch in the next few years .	-4.6105
30 suggestions were available , five are still in the race .	-2.3266
Far worlds .	-1.4587
More than 1000 planets in other stars have already found astronomers .	-1.7545
No one knows whether there are at least some of them .	-2.8790
The selection is difficult : to search for gravitational waves ?	-4.1345
Or rather explore the origin of cosmos ?	-1.7520
Or make monstrous planets and discover alien life ?	-7.0650
These are the questions which the European Space Agency Esa is responsible for .	-4.2556
They are looking for ideas for two major space projects for their Cosmic Vision programme , which is intended to bring research forward decisively .	-5.3088
The budget for such " L missions " is about one billion euros each .	-3.1254
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-2.5774
In early September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-1.9659
Thirty ideas were on the table , five of them have now come into the close election .	-6.1245
Many bodies assess the proposals , hats among researchers .	-5.0628
In the next few days a final decision will be taken by the scientific programme committee .	-4.0674
The Esa has selected four big questions to which the missions of the program " Cosmic Vision " are to find answers .	-6.4606
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?	-1.4691
The exact events surrounding these stars are still in the proverbial darkness .	-3.5225
A large infrared telescope in space could penetrate this gap .	-3.3918
And if a star has a planet under what circumstances can life develop there ?	-2.9459
To answer this question , the ' Cheops ' space telescope will be launched in 2017 , which will examine more closely the 500 already known planetary systems in our immediate vicinity .	-6.9911
But opportunities are limited , so Cheops is a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-3.2858
With larger instruments , astronomers could map earthy planets and even analyze the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indicator of biological activity .	-4.0021
How does the solar system work ?	-1.3167
This question , too , should ultimately determine the conditions for life to develop .	-6.2160
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role and the interaction of its magnetic field and its particle radiation with the planetary system .	-3.8381
In our solar system , these processes can be examined in exemplary manner .	-4.2063
With the " Solar Orbiter " , the Esa has already granted an M-class mission ( there the budget is about half a billion euros ) for this question .	-5.0110
The probe is scheduled to launch in 2017 and observe the surface and activity of the sun .	-3.6229
Of great interest to researchers are also Jupiter and his moons .	-3.5061
They want to figure out the role played by the giant planks in developing the solar system .	-3.8210
This is the first of the three L missions in the Cosmic Vision programme .	-4.0381
The sonde " juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moon Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-3.2092
Eight years later , she reaches Jupiter and is expected to study the atmosphere of the planet and the icy moon of Europe , Kallisto and Ganymede .	-5.4002
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.1159
The universe offers many possibilities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .	-5.9989
There may also be deviations that could guide the physicists the way to a new theory , under which all known laws of nature can be incorporated .	-5.9884
How did the universe come into being and what does it consist of ?	-3.2380
Our cosmos emerged from the big bang 13 billion years ago .	-3.1853
In addition to the familiar matter that we have , the stars , planets , and living beings as we exist , Dark Matter , whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and Dark Energy , which accelerates the expansion of space .	-6.8779
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first fractions of the Big Bang , nor do dark matter and dark energy exist .	-5.2690
With Euclid , the Esa has already approved an M mission , the launch of which is planned for 2020 .	-4.5994
With a special telescope , the probe should study the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time on the whole sky , enabling conclusions to be drawn on the nature of Dark Matter and Dark Energy .	-6.6787
Who could race	-5.1319
Of the 30 proposals , only two will be left at the end of the selection process .	-1.8151
In the opinion of many experts , the best chances of getting a certificate as an L mission is " E-Lisa " , a challenging concept for detecting gravitational waves .	-6.3872
Physicists understand the structure of space , which Albert Einstein predicted nearly 100 years ago .	-4.5857
They have not been shown as having been shown .	-7.2024
Elisa could do that , the scientists are hoping for the project .	-3.4952
The mission provides a detector consisting of two or three probes , which is deployed in space .	-4.1417
In contrast to plants on Earth , he could also prove gravitational waves that emerged at the big bang , providing new insights into the origins of cosmos .	-6.1872
Four more proposals are still competing for the second L-mission : a large X-ray telescope called " Athena " , which is intended to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure the cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which is intended to investigate and study the earthy planet .	-5.8245
Some suggestions for a sample return transport from Mars , the research on moon , Venus and asteroids , and solar physics have already been withdrawn .	-7.3111
Snowden ready to “ cooperate with Germany on US surveillance . ”	-2.6053
Edward Snowden , the whistleblower of the US Intelligence Service , has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and to announce before the German Bundestag , if the American National Security Agency and its Director Keith Alexander do not provide answers about their activities .	-5.5323
The German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where he received asylum to discuss his statement in Germany .	-3.9638
In a letter from Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday , he wrote : “ Although the result of my efforts was demonstrably positive , my government continues to treat a dissenting opinion as a fiduciary and attempts to criminalise political expression with threat of penalty , in which no defence is possible . ”	-6.3215
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-3.2582
In his letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that international community support can convince the US Government to let him fall .	-4.4847
The charge raised by the US Department of Justice includes espionage and theft of state property .	-2.9976
Germany ’ s Home Secretary , Hans-Peter Friedrich , said online about time : “ If Mr Snowden is ready to talk to German representatives , we will find ways to do that . ”	-5.2338
Relations between the US and Germany are tainted by claims that the NSA has intercepted Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-3.3279
Thomas Opmermann , the Member who leads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that he should seize the opportunity to listen to Snowden as a witness , if possible , “ without endangering it and totally ruining relations with the US . ”	-6.6063
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published a picture of himself and Snowden in his Twitter feed .	-4.0285
He was accompanied by two German journalists on his visit to Russia .	-2.0309
Ströbele explained that , according to the lawyer of the former NSA member , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-5.3309
When Snowden tells Germany , he needs an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the honourable Member says .	-3.8543
Snowden explains in his letter that he would face a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that expelled him from his home country .	-3.1951
But it is touched by the global response to “ my act of political expression . ”	-2.8989
Citizens around the world , as well as high-ranking politicians – including in the United States – have described the revelations of an uncontrolled system of comprehensive surveillance as a benefit to the general public .	-4.7418
In his letter , Snowden will provide the German authorities with an offer of cooperation , “ if the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-4.2832
Frontier Airlines charges for cabin baggage	-1.7465
Frontier Airlines plans to require up to $ 100 of passengers who wish to stow hand baggage on their flight .	-4.2465
Frontier Airlines intends to charge up to $ 100 for one piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even though the announcement on Wednesday was read that passengers should keep the whole can .	-4.7787
The new fee is valid for hand baggage in excess of the seat , small bags under the seat are still free of charge .	-4.2167
Frontier explained that you calculate USD 25 if the fee is paid in advance and USD 100 for passengers who were only paying at the gate .	-5.3190
Frontier-Speaker Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of USD 100 targets targets is moving travellers to pay in advance .	-5.0691
“ We do not want to calculate this sum , ” she explained .	-2.4215
In 2008 , airlines began demanding charges for the first and second piece of luggage .	-4.1257
Passengers who tried to avoid these have therefore added as much as possible to their hand baggage , which means that the luggage compartment above the seat is often overfilled .	-6.5503
Fees are one way to encourage passengers to take less on board .	-2.1250
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-2.5170
This is about the most loyal customers of Frontier , who would have clearly said that it would become increasingly difficult to find a place in the compartment above the seat .	-5.6694
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-2.1985
This means that a passenger on the platform of Frontier may carry a piece of baggage free of charge , but the next person must pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-4.6770
O 'Malley explained that the Frontier website and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers are informed of the charge before they arrive at the gate .	-4.2954
The new hand baggage fee from Frontier will enter into force only in the summer ; no exact date is yet available .	-4.8089
Passengers often travel through baggage allowance and other charges , but airlines are happy to use them .	-4.4144
They argue that baggage transportation costs money and passengers should pay this service if they wish .	-3.6804
Many on Wall Street see new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the cost of air travel after years of loss .	-3.9401
Most of them , however , have so far left the finger of charge for hand baggage .	-4.5404
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded first hand baggage charges three years ago , and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost airline .	-3.5395
The only other airline with such a charge is the Hungarian Wizz Air , the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-4.2573
In a report of December 2011 , he estimated that the carry-on duty would raise USD 50 million a year .	-5.6080
Sorensen , who had previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , recently flown with Spirit and was curious to see what would happen to him on the platform if passengers were faced with the unusual hand baggage fee of the company .	-7.0849
“ The boarding process was one of the most fluid I experienced in my career in aviation , ” he said .	-4.8196
I expected to see counter counters and handy discussions at the gate .	-3.3580
“ The plane was full , ” he explained , “ and the boarding run was as humbled . ”	-3.9845
Frontier also follows Spirit on the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.9121
The company explained that passengers who bought Limonade or Saft should keep all cans and coffee would be bottled free of charge .	-3.8437
Water is still free .	-1.0937
US Airways recently tried to demand money for soft drinks in 2008 , but cancelled it seven months later after passengers complained and no other major company had followed .	-6.4951
Frontier 's move to charge hand baggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-4.4967
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-3.3427
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers to purchase them directly , rather than through an online travel agency .	-4.7717
Frontier , however , has gone furthest in this area .	-2.8675
In September , the company started to earn only half the frequent flyer miles when booking an online travel agent .	-4.2706
On Wednesday , the miles were cut to 25 % of the route .	-2.7934
A flight trip with Frontier over 1000 miles booked with a third party company will therefore bring customers only 250 miles .	-5.6942
Passengers can also book only on the website of Frontier Platz .	-4.3023
Frontier has a loyal client base at its headquarters in Denver , but business is shrinking and the company is losing money .	-3.2904
The revenue declined by 9 % , and the aircraft capacity fell under 13 % in the first quarter , as stated in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc . , .	-5.0650
Republic has tried to control the finances of Frontier as part of its sale .	-4.6000
Say Comes from the Bible	-3.0790
Some 40 women visited the last women 's breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .	-3.3710
The theme of the day in the townhouse were " sayings from the Bible " and " interventions from the Middle Ages " .	-5.4104
After breakfast Zita Köhler , the chairman of the church council , went to the biblical sayings in a . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.1925
Say words contain realities , regulations or warnings , " she explained .	-4.0003
She compared several sayings with the corresponding Bible posts and explained the meaning .	-3.1575
They called sayings such as : Holzhauge was vigilant as scaling falls from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives his own in sleep , washing his hands in innocence .	-6.7940
Several times the speakers also let their listeners advice what proverb it was .	-4.6812
The Redeemer of the Middle Ages was adopted by the church patron , Christel Dehner : All good things are three , blue to make something .	-8.5284
She explained the meaning and origin of the speeches that she called ' bridges into the past ' .	-6.2016
Finally a raffle was given .	-2.8135
The prices were hidden on a table and were nicely sketched out before being handed over to the winners .	-5.3547
Among the visitors of the breakfast round was Roman Waizenegger , the Mayor of the country .	-5.0365
Learning instead of being unemployed : a pilot project for the unskilled in tourism	-4.0998
A pilot project for the tourism industry started today at the Mecklenburgische Seenplatte .	-2.9618
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who are already employed as unskilled in the industry are to be qualified for technical staff for hotels and restaurants over three winter months .	-5.9308
" New to this is that the six months of courses end with degrees , " said Carmen Wiechert of the work agency Neubrandenburg .	-4.4011
The benefits would be varied : the participants would not become unemployed , the firms would receive skilled workers , who were increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency should not finance unemployment .	-6.3543
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Neubrandenburg as well as the German Hotel and Restaurant Association ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project .	-3.2987
NSA declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame for the crash of the site .	-3.9221
The shadowy National Security Agency later declared that a mistake had put their public website a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-6.2043
“ NSA.gov was not available for a few hours tonight , because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in an e-mail message .	-5.8200
The problem was solved this evening .	-2.0420
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDoS ) is not true .	-2.2994
In the early evening hours , online server trackers noticed that the NSA site was not accessible for at least six hours , and this is still not available for some users .	-4.9589
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the sensitive internal network of the authority was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.8453
secret information is not in danger , as the speaker said .	-2.7271
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.2875
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page views until the server is overloaded and the website collapses .	-4.5540
Cyber-tactic is relatively simple , and attacks do not serve to enter the target system ’ s internal network .	-2.8937
The formerly secret NSA , whose nickname was No Search Agency ( none of which was an authority ) , is now in the light of the public eye and is now exposed to harsh criticism following the revelations that have become known in recent months about its extensive surveillance program at home and abroad – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by disenchanted former NSA staff Edward Snowden .	-7.7736
The growing controversy over the secret service fueled initial speculation that the incident today was the result of a targeted cyclone .	-4.1760
The number of people without jobs dropped in October by 22 to 1,307 .	-2.9117
Although the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and even better than in September , ' we would have hoped more ' , says Monika Felderer , Deputy Director of Labor in Sonthofen .	-4.9955
Because a large number of companies have responded so far when adjusting .	-5.3986
One reason , according to Felder-Bauer , is that " we have few skilled workers in the craft , healthcare and care for the elderly " .	-5.4354
Since September , the company has again introduced job offers for staff in the hotel and catering industry .	-5.9811
The winter season starts in the middle of December .	-2.4296

Bombardier ’ s Loss of Delivery and Orders	-3.5740
Bombardier Inc , a Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer , reported a 15 % drop in net profit on Thursday , after it had been put under pressure by a drop in orders and deliveries for aircraft in the third quarter , as well as contract problems in the railway segment .	-7.1707
Bombardier , based in Montreal , also did not publish flight test data for his brand-new CSeri aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious timetable for next September .	-6.0112
The maiden flight of the test aircraft a year and a half ago followed only three other starships , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned .	-5.9798
The results fell short of the forecasts and led to a crash of more than eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-4.8612
Cameron Doersen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his assessment of “ outperform ” on “ sector performance ” on Thursday , with a view to holding a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-6.0897
“ While weaker aircraft deliveries were expected to be as far as possible , we are clearly disappointed with the development of margins in the transport sector , ” said Doersen in a customer letter .	-6.3032
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for the CSeri when the testing program for the plane moves forward .	-4.8964
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical about the programme .	-2.9901
Bombardier hopes that the CSeries series can catapult the company into the lower market segment that is currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-4.1057
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and , after several months of delay , flew for the first time in September .	-3.3360
But , up to now , binding orders for CSeries are at 177 , because potential buyers are waiting for the results of the flight tests and want to see whether the company ’ s claims regarding fuel efficiency and cost savings potential are valid for the new jet aircraft .	-7.5405
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-1.9050
CEO Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach its target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of the commercial use of the jet .	-3.4093
The company 's management also assured analysts and the media on Thursday that the programme was on schedule .	-4.1899
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” said Beaudoin at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft ’ s standing time , ground tests and software updates were planned .	-4.6858
Each manufacturer is planning a different approach .	-3.1993
We have decided to take a first flight and then attach an overworked period , as we have done .	-8.2804
This happens throughout the whole programme .	-3.2480
The second of five test aircraft is expected to start in the next few weeks , the rest shortly afterwards , the company ’ s side said .	-5.0263
Nevertheless , analysts remain skeptical that 12 months after the maiden flight , the first customer can launch an aircraft of the CSeri .	-5.0806
Bombardier said it will review the planning for the start-up ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-3.8999
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even if it seems to correspond to Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning is moving to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doersen .	-5.1485
In the third quarter at the end of September , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of 172 million , respectively $ 9 cents per share in the previous year .	-3.8784
The adjusted profit per share is equal to 9 cents .	-2.7811
Sales decreased slightly , from 4.2 billion dollars to 4.1 billion dollars .	-10.3707
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4,56 billion , as Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-3.0421
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer says that it delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decrease of 57 last year .	-3.7126
Net orders fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-1.4352
The order book in the aerospace sector was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September and was unchanged from 31 December .	-4.4560
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were within the framework of our requirements , but the low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-5.4846
Sales in the aerospace sector fell by 13 % to two billion dollars .	-2.8716
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , has announced that sales in this sector have risen by almost 11 % to $ 2.1 billion .	-3.9821
The order book in the transport sector was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September and was slightly increased on 31 December .	-3.5066
The profit margin in the field of transport was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-4.1219
According to the company ’ s management , new targets will be set for the fourth quarter .	-4.0032
In the afternoons trading on Thursday , the Bombardier share dropped by 8.5 % and stood at 4.83 Canadian dollars , after it was announced that the Google Finance Board will change Patrick Pichette to the Board of Directors . , , , and . , , , and , , , and , , , , , , and . , , , , , ,	-12.0102

Koko-dependent lawyer who warned drug boss of police investigation must go to prison .	-4.2510
Bashrat Ditta , 42 , provided information on the Underworld Size Neil Scarborough .	-4.8680
The lawyer was afraid that his secret dependence on drugs could come to light .	-2.6650
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-1.7868
A well-known criminal defender who warned a drug baron from a large police investigation because he was afraid of exposing his secret drug addiction was sentenced to three years in prison .	-4.8212
Bashrat Ditta , 42 , provided the underworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information on investigations into its drug trafficking activities after being compromised by his own cocaine addiction .	-4.9747
The lawyer , dubbed “ first-class ” by criminals , nicknamed “ Bash , ” was arrested in his house in 2011 after the police monitored Scarborough , which he had represented in a previous drug procedure .	-6.5826
Officials watched Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags of cocaine to the lawyer 's house in Blackburn , Lancashire , while being with colleagues at a dinner of the bar .	-4.9997
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly used Class A drugs after having been found in his hair , on his wallet , and on credit cards in tests of cocaine .	-4.3447
For a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorised information about the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of his partners .	-2.8522
All four suspects were then supervised by the police in a major investigation into heroin and cocaine trafficking in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.2818
They were arrested later , together with 32 others , after the police secured heroin and cocaine at <unk> 1.5 million worth of house searches and <unk> 200,000 in cash .	-5.1600
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared that his drug dependence could become public .	-3.7725
Today , Ditta , who is working for the firm Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and sentenced to two counts of obstruction in Liverpool Crown Court after a three-week trial .	-5.1550
During an earlier survey , he admitted ownership of the cocaine .	-4.4497
The lawyer was transferred after the police found out in her investigation against Scarborough that in February 2011 he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta .	-3.8143
Two investigators followed the suspects and saw how he went to Dittas ’ house and put the drugs under the law ’ s rubbish bins with a purity of 60 % in a black golf .	-5.3249
Shortly after he had delivered the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephone with Ditta , who was at dinner in the Blackburn Rovers football stadium in Ewood Park .	-4.7868
The lawyer returned home , took the drugs and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-2.5120
In the court it became known that Ditta was a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine , after having been discovered in his hair , wallet , and credit cards for drug tests in class A .	-5.5939
Ditta was later arrested , but denied to take cocaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client , alleging that her discussion was subject to the “ law secret . ”	-6.1439
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were secured and a hair sample was taken from him .	-4.8276
In the case of police interrogation , he said that he would run an office and clients at home for legal matters , both at his private address and at the workplace .	-6.0662
It became known in the court that he had called for important actors in the drug trade , some of which had previously been represented , after significant arrests and informed what the investigators knew about them .	-4.9937
Councillor Anne Whyte said , “ A criminal lawyer should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . ”	-3.5974
Ditta is accused of abuse of his position as a criminal defender because he has become too deeply involved with certain clients .	-4.0793
The relationship in question is not simply that of a drug dealer , but a drug dealer who supplies drugs to his lawyer .	-2.9247
Some of his communications were undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer for these people .	-3.3817
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.5810
He looked forward to the police investigation as far as possible , so that they could continue to pursue their criminal activities .	-4.0077
Mr Ditta brought his profession into disrepute .	-3.0629
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.3039
Ditta dismissed any misconduct and claimed , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , what I was not , and wanted to pass information on to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but immediately do it . ”	-5.9261
But after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said of the police in Lancashire : “ Mr Ditta has taken the step from a criminal defence to a criminal at the moment he began to buy drugs from organised criminals . ”	-5.0679
His coke addiction led to a hopeless compromise and made him susceptible to the motives of leading members of organised crime who commissioned him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-4.7919
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and provide public confidence and confidence .	-2.5968
Ditta has betrayed this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-3.0426
The Lancashire ’ s Serious and Organized Crime Unit led the investigation of Ditta , which also led to a condemnation in three cases of cocaine and judicial obstruction , underlining our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-5.6947
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that nobody can escape the arm of the law .	-2.3915
We will find you and bring you to court .	-1.8442
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison after being guilty to the Conspiracy of heroin , cocaine , and cannabijandel .	-3.8062
Thirty-five more people involved in the drug trade were sentenced to total penalties for 153 years for drug offences .	-5.9870
On his website , Ditta published an area of questions and answers about himself in which he attacks his dream job be represented as a lawyer on death row in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity was the motivation for his work .	-7.7122
Revolutional work of church music	-2.0638
At the end of the celebrations for its 160-year existence , the Liederkranz Dunningen will frame two divine services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-3.9955
After the great success of the musicals " Rock my Life " , which was enthralled by the spectators in the spring of this year , the Liederkranz will enrich two divine services with the performance of Franz Schubert 's German fair .	-5.4239
On Saturday , October 26 , this extraordinary fair will be to be heard from 19 at the evening fair in the St. Martino Church Dunningen and on Sunday , 27 , October from 10.in the church of St. John Baptist in Lac.	-7.5257
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Geszung der Veranstaltungen des Veranstaltungen " , D 872 , is an intellectual music work of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and at the time of the formation was almost revolutionary .	-7.3345
The exhibition is performed within the framework of the services of God , as the principal Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.4055
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the group of musicians Frohsine Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ .	-3.8978
Haslach : Skepticism Strongly Confi	-4.2690
For example , with the elections to the Senate in 2015 , the peace unit Haslach ( SE ) will change fundamentally .	-5.6830
There is then only one common parish church for all six parishes .	-4.2285
In a joint meeting on Saturday the boards from Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welschenksteinach prepared for the changes .	-4.1226
There is nothing more to change in the basic decisions of the diocese and it is up to the parish authorities to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-5.6104
Over the course of the day , it became particularly clear that skepticism about the new is waning slowly but becoming increasingly confident .	-6.2450
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main concerns of the sea care system were held .	-7.1672
Regionaldekan Georg Schmitt explained on the basis of a presentation the new directives for soul care units in the archdiocese Freiburg .	-5.2000
After that , the SE Haslach , as a church parish , will in future form a body of public law that will enter the rights and duties of the six church communities previously .	-6.9462
There will only be a common parish council and a council of foundations in which the parish is represented .	-5.3011
Each parish should have at least two elected members , and in the six parishes there are called community teams .	-5.5591
Her future task will be to promote ecclesiastical life in the village .	-3.2969
The question of the finances of the individual parish then showed a great need for .	-4.1630
The new releases show that the collected funds in the parishes will be allocated to them .	-8.2991
However , the obligations are passed on to the whole community .	-5.0540
It was particularly with regard to the large investments that were being made , the commitment of which was then made by all the parish workers .	-7.5401
" Even in the past , only projects that were managed by the individual parishes alone were invested " , relative Haslach 's Co-chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-6.5862
Practical experience with a common body for five parishioners revealed Barbar Ritter , the chairman of the body in the Soulguard Unit Schutterwald-Neuried .	-6.0466
They set themselves the task of 2006 : ' becoming one , staying five ' and finding that this is not so easy .	-6.4299
The authorities of the Haslacher Peace Unit then responded to the questions on the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-6.3825
The modifications will be made in subsequent meetings and will be finalised at a further joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-5.6732
In the end , parish colonel Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the peace unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-4.9400
In Pfulzenf the electricity is becoming more expensive .	-3.5840
The citizens of Pfullendorfs must prepare for higher electricity costs .	-3.0254
As the managing director of the city ’ s buildings , Jörg Arne Bias , confirmed against the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pfullendorfer family will cost 70 to 90 euros a year .	-6.3312
The main reason for the forthcoming price increase is the rise in the so-called EEG envelope from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-3.1920
Every year , the four operators of the big electric roads reassessed this envelope .	-7.0529
These figures indicate the additional costs that will result from the energy transition , which they can raise by means of a levy above the electricity price .	-6.9067
The Pfulldorf Municipal Works are the last link in this chain .	-3.3824
In his forecasts , the supervisory board of the energy company even had assumed a higher levy , as reported by Jörg Arne Bias .	-4.0913
Now the actual figures would have to be calculated before the cities could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-4.5154
" We are going to move from an increase of 1 cent plus x " , says Bias , with the number more close to the 2 cent .	-4.9157
Set on permanent red Ampel : watch Waiting Time	-5.3356
Sometimes a light isn 't green .	-3.8325
The contact loop in the street does not react or the light sign is broken .	-3.3753
What do you do then - drive with red ?	-4.6570
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgarter lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorrad " .	-4.4194
The waiting time , however , must be ' appropriate ' , which could be interpreted differently from case to case .	-4.4893
Becker advises to stay at least five minutes before starting from a dysfunction of the traffic light .	-6.0854
However , anyone who continues to drive despite red light must be aware that he is entirely responsible for an accident .	-5.2247
Anyone who tolerates less than five minutes may not wait long enough , warns Becker and refers to a decision of the Supreme Court Hamm .	-3.5765
In the negotiated case , after about three minutes , a driver had ignored the traffic light and had to answer for a negligent red light breach .	-7.0833
The traffic lights were not broken , but jumped into green a little later .	-4.0680
He was barred from driving because of his special situation - but he did not pay the fine .	-5.9211
The Municipal Council looks forward to a solid budget	-3.1933
Whenever community meetings are about the budget , Mayor Ralph Gerster has laughed well .	-4.2135
The local councillor in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled , and debt does not know the administration since 2005 .	-3.6616
In this sense , 2012 can also be considered a full success .	-3.2942
This was evident in the presentation of the annual accounts for 2012 .	-2.9304
As Andrea Rothmund pointed out , the administrative budget , with some EUR 7.6 million over a million , would have been higher than planned .	-4.9122
The surplus of the administrative budget , with some EUR 1.8 million over the approach , also exceeded some EUR 1 million .	-5.4674
The surplus is mainly due to higher trade taxes and the share of the community 's income tax .	-5.5642
The budget , too , was clear about the planned levels .	-3.8626
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , last year it amounted to EUR 2.5 million .	-2.5685
" This is essentially due to the increased allocation from the administrative budget " , says Rothmund .	-3.7354
Since less investment was made in 2012 than was planned , the repayment allowances have also been higher .	-4.2725
In total , the overall reserve could be increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million .	-4.1376
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for the good work .	-2.4190
" Thus a work is not simply dumped out of the sleeve " , Gerster praised with a view to the annual accounts .	-5.0166
He and the local councils were obviously happy with the good figures .	-2.4653
It may sound paradoxical , but these are the good figures that citizens could soon find expensive .	-4.9406
Due to its good financial position , the municipality could in the past renounce high levels of debt .	-6.1351
This , however , according to Gerster , has often been reduced by the country 's subsidies .	-4.7675
There are conditions for these grants from various compensation levels .	-4.3450
Among other things , cities and municipalities applying for grants must have certain levels .	-5.1773
" We need to look at the subject of heatsets , because in the years to come there will be investment for which we would like to have subsidies , " Gerster said in this context .	-6.8369
Nagold : Hugo Werkstatt in the Choir for 60 years	-2.9631
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was honoured .	-5.0480
As usual , Hubert Werkstatt was on stage in the colours of his male singing band .	-4.6271
Even after 60 years , singing with the choir , which is now more than happy , is still a great pleasure .	-6.4585
The club has also been active , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .	-4.7469
He received several awards for his commitment and his club direction : Jörg Kohr , Pastoralreferent on behalf of the C<unk>cilienUnion Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented to him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and a honorary letter signed by bishop Fürst .	-13.4159
His fellow singers presented the certificate of the German Choral Union and a engraved tin teller .	-3.6217
In addition to the award , the 31st autumn festival went on familiar tracks : The MGV Vier , the Liederkranz Salzstetten , the Sängerdivision Baising and the local music club had invited the Vollmaringer a varied mix of different choirs and singing styles , which kept around 400 visitors .	-9.1683
The MGV full-maringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " Im Weinparadies " and " Lustig , her brothers " .	-5.7541
To honour the Honorary Secretary Hubert Werkstadt , they prepared a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozarts ' Bundeslied ' .	-6.6029
The Männergesangverein Vie sang also classic choral songs such as " Jägeradvertise " by Julius Wegert , " Width , far away " by Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-5.5737
The Liederkranz Salzstetten was responsible for the participation of women in the festival with its mixed choir and its group of women - the " Impulskull " .	-4.7101
The mixed choir escaped from foreign countries with the Neapolitan folk style " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " from Antos Gus , while the " Impulchor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jude " were part of their program .	-5.5545
The singer ’ s department of the Baissinger Sportverein returned with " What the Schwob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Papperts " Bierlied " , where the Vollmaringer Musikverein offered the crowning musical conclusion .	-6.6468
For the children there was a small side program - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollstemer led up a casino theatre and read a few stories that children attended the lunchtime over well .	-7.3855

Bauhaus provides the material with support of the Sparkasse Zollernalb .	-2.3252
It will be delivered to the kindergarten on the agreed day and will then be directly processed by the helpers .	-5.0815
Helpers can be parents , grandparents , friends , associations and , of course , educators and children themselves .	-2.3429
Kenyan press disgusts over controversial media law	-3.4846
“ We are in a frightening situation and we can ask ourselves : what does Parliament think of doing away with judicial independence tomorrow ? ” was read in the paper , which does not consider the draft law constitutionally .	-6.2369
“ The law is draconian and very criminal , and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Managing Director of the Capital Group , including CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most respected independent radio stations and news websites .	-4.3916
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be biased , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.9050
“ I hope the President will listen to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.4889
According to The Star newspaper , the government ’ s new law “ effectively wiping the media into a stranglehold , ” writes The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of Redeemer in Kenya “ suffered a major blow , ” praising the draft as “ draconian . ”	-6.6597
Adoption of the law is one of a number of measures to strengthen national security following the attacks by armed Islamists on the Western gate shopping centre in September .	-4.0060
The Kenyan media drew the wrath of the authorities , because they published safety cameras on which to see how the units sent to the resort supposedly wiped out the luxurious shopping mall .	-6.1905
Police chief David Kimaiyo responded to interrogating two journalists and one leading media representative , even though the subpoena was withdrawn for a media outcry .	-3.8989
Under the new law , media houses can be punishable by up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to a million , as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-5.6655
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the property of those affected if a penalty is not paid .	-2.7561
According to Daily Nation , “ a single penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-2.6413
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on the description of Kenya ’ s “ vibrant blogosphere . ”	-3.1444
If they silenced the media , politicians could do whatever they want with impunity .	-3.9150
“ No one will ever know it , ” wrote Mutuma Mathiu , a journalist at the nation that calls Kenya ’ s media a crucial factor in public life control .	-5.8803
“ Leaving politicians to themselves , they lead the country into bankruptcy and return to the time of the hunters and gatherers , ” he commented .	-5.3006
Kenya ’ s legislators have been making public anger in the past .	-3.4126
In May , they voted to reverse the cuts imposed by the national compensation commission , and reinstated their default wages of around 532,000 reels per month – one of the world ’ s highest .	-6.3491
Bad-Dürrheim : A dream becomes true for the FC	-3.3572
The official opening ceremony for the artificial turf field , despite the cold weather and the rain , did not stop at the importance of the city and the football club .	-5.6477
A more pleasant holiday was probably the last Saturday , but Peter did not want to play .	-5.6365
For example , all those who arrived without a parachute or could not hold one for any reason .	-6.0419
This went to the musicians who rallied around the Festakt , as did some speakers .	-5.7849
So Nass was also the FC-Chairman Albrecht Schlenker who spoke of a dream .	-4.8665
His thanks were mainly due to Mayor Walter Klupp , who was very committed to the implementation of the project , the Municipal Council , the participating companies and members of the association who took part .	-6.4219
Here especially Lothar Held , Paul Weizenegger , Heiner Gail and Peter Graf .	-2.0108
The armed pensioners laid back 400 square meters of pavement for the new paths .	-4.8874

Other greetings were addressed to Hubert Baier , the district chairman of the Southern Baden Football Union , Kuno Kayan , and Friedrich Knorr of the Planning Office , who announced a donation to the Club ’ s youth department .	-5.4214
Mayor Klupp reminded us that recurrent weather-related influences in the spring and autumn put the original lawn in a way that it could not be .	-5.3339
As early as 15 years ago , we had the first reflections on the solution to the problem , when we thought about building a third place at the football club area or at the secondary school in Lake Salinensee .	-6.7151
Both have been rejected .	-1.8256
Six years ago , there were thoughts about creating an artificial turf camp , which was generally regarded as the ultimate solution .	-4.3970
Concrete planning took place two years ago , when the FC took over the Schabelstube in Erdächt , pledged a cost share of EUR 100 000 to build the place , and the country approved funding of EUR 104 000 .	-6.4183
In October 2012 , the Municipal Council decided to take over the remaining EUR 356 000 to the total cost of EUR 560 000 , compose Klipp .	-4.3023

Pronolds also believes that imposing a toll on all cars would be just a first step .	-3.9205

Vienna Airport is making passenger calls .	-3.0762
Mr Max Maier , please come to Gate 24 .	-0.9790
The Wien-Schwechat Airport will no longer exist in future .	-4.7349
Most of the speaker passes away - the noise level is to be significantly reduced .	-5.7060
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .	-2.2712
As Airport-Prescher Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , the Vienna airport is following an international trend with the recruitment of enquiries concerning individual persons .	-5.5517
For example , airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai are already avoiding the noise calls .	-4.5148
In the absence of these enquiries - on average , around 200 personal calls from the loudspeakers on a day - the airport should be more quiet in the future .	-7.6008
" It has also been shown in experience that these individual enquiries have been relatively little perceived , but at the same time all other information on changed flight times or departures are missing here " , says Kleemann in conversation with the radio station .	-8.9811

According to Lexicon , Déjà Vu is a psychological phenomenon that expresses itself in the sense that a new situation has already experienced or seen .	-4.9114
In the case of a visit by the eponymous café at the Opreise in the district of Kleve , in sight of the Rhine Waal University , it must not remain the pure déjà Vu feeling .	-7.7987
After all , the café with its beautiful name has exactly the aim : to make a real stay not only mentally , but rather to keep being experienced again .	-8.6740
Because it 's just fun and just nice .	-3.6756
A glance into the inner life on the Opel 8 gives the viewer a good feeling at first sight .	-5.5817

" Nice , successful and funny " , the two 33-year-olds found .	-3.2333
But it is not Jedermann 's business .	-3.8204
Daniel Büttner may not be a fan of event evenings , either , for that reason : " You cannot make all the right " .	-7.6264
And with an event I always speak only those who are interested in the special event .	-3.7918
That is why events will be the exception of us .	-5.3148

In the chateau of the restaurant " Witteborg " in Dinker everyone enjoyed the harmonious cooperation entirely in the sign of music .	-7.4628

UN proclaiming Poverty Reduction	-2.2063
The United Nations is now beginning to draw up a series of new objectives to replace the Millennium Development Goals announced 12 years ago for combating poverty .	-4.2930
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in promoting “ sustainable development goals , ” which are supposed to replace the 2015 Millennium Goals .	-4.3245
They were included in the final draft document , which will be adopted by world leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.6719
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said in the evening that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.7270
“ I am pleased that member states have agreed to embark on a process to agree on universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.4095
“ These goals will build on our progress in the Millennium Development Goals and form an integral part of the 2015 Development Framework .	-2.8009
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States to achieve our vision of the SDGs that build on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.5327
Although the SG Achim / Baden has been without victory for four days , the handball upper league still feels good .	-6.2003
Trainer Tomasz Malmon leaves no doubt about this at all .	-3.4525
Everyone is still fully motivated in this matter .	-5.6816
However , I hope that we will finally win again .	-2.9958
" After all , I don 't know how a victory is getting any more , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at VfL Fredenbeck II .	-6.0162
Even though the Fredenbeck third-party reserve has not yet wiped out trees , Malmon is warning in advance .	-6.1659
Many players still trained me in A-youth .	-5.9043
Therefore , they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-3.8833
" Moreover , it is important to wait to see if there is still some reinforcement from the first one , " clarifies the SG-Coach .	-6.8678
In order to finally return to success , the Malamon team must definitely increase compared to previous appearances .	-6.0203
The last thing was a huge amount of work on the cover and on the shift .	-5.9809
The recycling of opportunities must also definitely improve .	-4.0070
So I hope my players have finally got their head free during the short break .	-3.4645
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-3.0012
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eye of Samora Machel ’ s statue , the founder of state , and the first President of Mozambique , to vote for a rare public demonstration of peace calls .	-7.3099
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , director of an investment company .	-2.0616
For fear of the country ’ s future , she has exchanged her business clothes for a T-shirt with the inscription “ We demand security ” in Portuguese , and on Thursday she joined the crowd on the independence square of the capital .	-5.8660
For two weeks now , there have been reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , one of the worst battles since the peace agreement more than 20 years ago .	-4.2180
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement that was initially supported by White ruled Rhodesia and later by South Africa ’ s apartheid government in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-4.4132
After the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-2.3266
Analysts consider it unlikely that the country will return to a full-scale conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.3401
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge deposits of gas off the coast and coal camps in the northwest could bring in investment of more than $ 50 billion from companies like Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy , and Anadarko from the US in the next few years .	-6.1156
The ruling Frelimo party , since 1975 , the dominant force , and Renamo blames each other for tensions .	-5.4119
Renamo claims that the government has provoked the recent clashes by attacking its members in Sofala province , a traditional stronghold of Renamos , on 17 October .	-3.9855
The attacks on the former rebels escalated as government troops attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , the group ’ s leader , Renamos Speaker told the Financial Times .	-4.1450
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.8368
President Armando Guebuza has tried to downplay concerns about instability .	-2.8090
On Wednesday , opposite AFP , the French news agency , he said that Dhlakama views himself as a “ loser , ” who wants to use “ all the remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.5523
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-2.1294
However , there has been an increase in concern since Mazanga was quoted as saying that Renamo is abandoning the 1992 peace agreement .	-5.1593
He explained to the FT that he meant that Frelimo no longer respected the agreement .	-3.3454
“ Our vision is to start negotiations again and , indeed , seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-3.4282
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a series of clashes this year .	-3.5480
“ We have two adult men here ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who meet the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , lecturer at Open University and Mozambique experts .	-3.3658
None of them is good in bargaining and no one is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-3.2972
Renamo , who is pushing for electoral reform , has already said that she will boycott the November local elections .	-3.2730
Presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-3.1253
Some commentators have interpreted the use of violence as an attempt to incite a ailing movement to gain government concessions and financial concessions .	-3.6817
Renamos ’ s electoral succession has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , the Movement of Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , founded by a former Renamo member , is likely to improve in the elections .	-5.9731
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation is due when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-3.3896
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-3.1800
It is unclear what capacity Mr Renamo has , but she has made troublesome attacks on police stations and vehicles on an important North-South connection .	-4.6292
Most of the fighting took place in the province of Sofala , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , but which is located Beira , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale for the export of coal .	-6.6120
In June , Rio broke off for a month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-4.1562
Mazanga answered reluctantly whether Renaamo would repeat that threat .	-4.0959
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-2.9330
Instability has increased frustration with the government , says Fernando Lima , director of Mediaroop , an independent media company , because many people were already worried about corruption , the slow progress in development and a recent wave of abduction .	-4.7241
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-2.8799
Omar Sultana , a demonstrant , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.8352
“ No one is interested in Renaamo and Frelimo , they simply want peace and usable roads , ” he explained .	-3.0250
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models for life ” , an author says .	-3.4506
The stories of Thor showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrates how important it is to have a dream .	-3.1861
Many myths , however , are “ far too wild , too infectious , and , in some cases , too dirty to be taught at schools , ” and Crossley Holland argued for “ careful selection ” of age-sensitive works .	-5.5223
“ I find it wonderful that myths and folklore are already part of education in America , ” he said .	-2.3709
I have proposed this as a plan for 20 years .	-1.7614
He added that , for authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ be eliminated completely , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ hidden . ”	-5.8359
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , explained : “ You can follow certain intentions , but you should keep them in mind as much as possible . ”	-4.8184
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult author writing for adults and an author writing for children is the need to convey hope .	-2.9406
Not everything needs to be simplified or lead to the happy end , but there is an inherent sense of good and evil .	-4.1063
It must be signalled below that history reveals and does not explain .	-5.0216
This is the old story of a show rather than a story .	-3.4948
Hansjakob is yet another move in Freihof	-4.0336
100 years ago Heinrich Hansjakob moved to Haslach ’ s retirement , and his last years were brought to life in the “ Freihof ” on Sunday .	-5.8552
The many spectators were thrilled by the very short scenes .	-3.9958

And then the scene began , in which Alois Krafczyk once again shines in his Paraderolle as the city ’ s great son .	-4.6563
He applied to style with the Twilight and Black Forest Fuchs by Erich Becher from Mühlenbach .	-6.3652
Not only was he received with a lot of applause by the audience , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-3.4654
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly well to entrust herself to the role of the sister and gave her an unaltered life in mimic and gesture .	-5.1508
The Mühlbach farmers ' band played selected music between the different stages of the game , completing the performance .	-6.9250
For the award of the honorary citizen , Haslach Mayor Heinz Winkler gave himself the honor , who , in representing the then official owner Hättich , together with a part of the city council , made his ascent .	-8.2072
Her upbringing then made the three-king singer , who led Hansjakob to the cry : " Oh how beautiful , there are again memories of my own three-time king " .	-9.6548
With their song " O Jessulein " they enjoyed the public at the Freihof as well as the storytelling skiers with their loud " out , out " .	-7.1170
At that time , his criticism of the Church of the State had been as strongly expressed as his concern about agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-6.6587
He found his resting place in the home , behind his chapel at Hofstetten .	-4.8219
" A quiet mind finally found his calm and had gone secret forever , " it was said at the end of the scene game .	-5.6497
There was a lot of applause and many praising words from the audience for the performance .	-4.7080
Basketball : The Hope of the Neckar Giant Grows	-1.4911
The chances of the Ligaremaining of the Ludwigsburger Bundesliga basketball team have increased .	-4.9606
If there is a wildcard procedure , there is now less competition for the Neckar giants .	-3.8646
The basketball project Hamburg Towers does not offer an application for a possible aftermarket .	-4.5243
" We will not participate in the wildcard process , " said ex-national player Pascal Roller , who since 2012 has set up the concept for a professional club in the Hanseatic city .	-4.2999
However , a first breath was not heard from Ludwigsburg .	-3.6601
" We did not deal with the wildcard procedure , so long as it is not clear that Düsseldorf receives no license , " said Neckar giants Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-6.1650
By May 23 , upward Düsseldorf Basket can still file documents to the arbitration court and prove its Bundesliga suitability .	-7.1381
Until now , however , the Rhine countries have been refused the licence twice .	-3.0860
The arbitration court is the last instance .	-2.3730

The body was found on the following night in Cerro Pelado , 15 km north of the exclusive beach resort Punta del Este .	-2.9692
As an alibi , a five-year-old half-sister of the young they had taken along should say that she was sexually assaulted by the boy .	-4.7924
But when the girl described the crime before the police without mentioning an attack against them , the two boys gave up the deliberate killing of the 11-year-old .	-4.4830

Court blocked decision on the NYPD Stop-and-Friction Directive	-3.0103
On Thursday , a Federal Employment Court in the United States blocked the formation of a judge who had requested changes to the Stop and Hairk program of the New York Police Department , and expelled the judge from the case .	-6.5530
The 2nd United States Court of Appeals declared that Judge Shira Seidlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until the city was determined to appeal .	-6.8575
The judge had ruled in August that the city was violating the Constitution with the way the program for keeping and asking people is implemented .	-5.0110
The city appealed against its assessment and the imposed relief measures , including the decision to set up a monitoring authority to assist the police in changing their directive and training programmes .	-8.2804
The appeal court heard on Tuesday the case for a suspension .	-3.0571
The appeal report stated that the judge had to be waived from the case , because she violated the code of conduct for US judges by specifying that a judge should avoid the appearance of bias ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly responded to the court ’ s criticism .	-7.2203
The judge had ordered that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they were inappropriately targeted by black and Latin American men with the stop-and-tape programme .	-5.4055
They appointed an external position to monitor the implementation of major changes , including reforms in directives , training and service supervision , and ordered a pilot program of body-driven cameras in districts where most controls were carried out .	-5.3786
In August , the city of New York agreed to end the practice of storing names and addresses of persons released after police control .	-3.3711
An oral hearing on the vocation of the city is planned after 14 March 2014 .	-3.7441
The Stop-and-hour tactics have been criticised by a number of civil rights campaigners .	-3.2749
Controls of this kind have been in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded controls has risen to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men during the tenure of the party-less Mayor Michael Bloomberg .	-5.6686
In 2004 , four men , all of whom belong to minorities , filed a lawsuit that became collective redress .	-6.2585
Advocates of changes to the NYPD Stop-and-Friction Programme say that the changes will end unfair practices and create a more reliable and effective police force and influence the way other police departments use the scheme .	-5.6075
Opponents argue that the changes would dampen the police ’ s morals , but not criminality ; money would also be wasted and the broader problem of a police force under pressure following the disappearance of thousands of posts in the last decade would not be solved .	-5.4997
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-tape practice , which was constitutional , but only reformed the way the NYPD implemented controls .	-5.4002

Rainer Prewo , the former OB of Nagold , had made a proposal to equip this vehicle with a photovoltaic plant and now plans to work in consultation with the association , according to Henne .	-5.7138
In 2008 , in the record time of just under one week , the Zimmerei Schleeh from Baiersbronn created the hospital in Socogim , an elephant quarter on the outskirts of the capital - honorable .	-6.7023
Henne also mentioned a new maternity child hospital in Nouakchott .	-1.7649
Especially interesting in times when the birth clinic should be rationalised away in Nagold .	-4.2627
Many people learn as a medical doctor in Africa , say Henne , for example , deceleration against Burn-out .	-4.0529
Due to the political unrest in the country , it was not possible to make as many journeys as planned , but many doctors came to Germany for this to become hospitalized in various areas .	-7.5138

Coulson set telephony hacking to check a tip .	-3.0890
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson allegedly put “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” in an attempt to endorse a false tip about a case by then-Home Secretary Charles Clarke .	-5.6809
Public prosecutor Andrew Edis QC explained to the court in the Old Bailey , News of the World a false rumor in May 2005 that Clarke would have a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-4.9638
The newspaper instructed Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlby 's voicemail , and followed her , but Coulson also called her and left messages on how the court learned .	-6.3815
“ According to the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office , Coulson , who is now the editor of the NotW , no one who stands in front of the home of people and hopes to put it on a fresh act , but one who likes to face a story to see her reaction , ” said Edis .	-7.0571
He said , NotW uses three techniques to research stories investigative : phone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation .	-3.2158
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.5594
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , otherwise it cannot be .	-3.1354
What about the first ?	-1.5527
Does he know about phone hacking ?	-1.0509
He disputes this , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-3.2179
Rumours about a Clarkes affair were first taken up by the features editorial of NotW , when a source that was sexually interested in Pawlby was said : “ Do not waste your time , it is with Charles . ”	-4.6404
A band with voicemails from their phone at least three occasions was guaranteed in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-3.9932
The investigators also found entries on the computer of the detective where Pawlby and her sister were saved as “ projects . ”	-4.3895
At the time when the searches were carried out , Pawlby 's grandparents received anonymous calls asking for information about them , Edis explained .	-4.4616
Meanwhile , former chief reporter Neville Thurbeck and former reporter James Weatherup supervised the monitoring of the movements of Pawlby .	-3.0515
On June 18 , 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story that we want to get out tomorrow , which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-3.9644
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as that of other important figures , such as former Secretary of State David Blunkett .	-4.5426
On Thursday , the brothers heard that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman for an affair when he himself was tied to the co-accused Rebekah Brooks , who had been married at that time .	-13.1297
Coulson and Brooks argue that they have vowed to hack telephones between October 3 , 2000 and August 9 , 2006 .	-2.4523

Gehing : No absolute protection possible	-2.2938
" We want to bring the residents into the planning early " , the mayor Jens Hä<unk>ler opened the public information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-6.1540
Around 80 participants had come to the municipal hall to explain the planned measures , ask questions , express concerns and introduce ideas .	-4.9621
More frequently , it was stated that ' eventual decisions are made by the members of the local council ' .	-5.7773
The flood that hit China unprepared on May 15 , 2009 was a momentous event that raised the question of protection for the future , says Hä<unk>ler .	-5.9348
A river basin survey was commissioned with the neighbouring municipality of Aidlingen , which is now based on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.5472
" The protection of as many cultivated land as possible is the goal " , says cottage .	-6.3249
It is designed to protect against any static flooding that is expected to occur every 100 years according to the German weather service .	-6.3869
A 15 % surcharge applies to climate change .	-3.3715
In technical circles this is referred to as " HQ 100a climate " .	-3.7622
The water masses , which caused considerable damage in Gechingen in 2009 , resulted in a 1000-year flooding .	-3.7949
" There is no absolute protection , but a relative improvement can be achieved " , says Hä<unk>ler .	-3.3669
In order to protect the HQ 100a climate , around four million euros must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality being able to count on some 70 % of national subsidies .	-6.2235
At the same time , however , Hä<unk>ler pointed out that there would only be support if an overall approach were implemented .	-6.2831
In order to do this , the community must have the participation of its citizens .	-4.9427
An elaborate planning and approval procedure must be completed .	-2.3800
In the best case , implementation could begin in 2016 .	-1.6569
Among other things , the concept of protection presented in the municipal council last week ( we reported ) foresees local measures in the inflow of the Irm River from the Tauenheimer Valley .	-5.2534
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to submit their requests .	-3.2895
Among other things , it was called into question why no more dams and retention pools were planned to protect the place .	-5.7909
Gregor Kühn , the technical planner of the commissioned Engineering Office Forest and Corbe from Hügelsheim , who introduced the concept , stressed that it required the interaction of all the measures presented to reach the desired target in the sum .	-6.4084
In addition , the most economical solution is to be found , according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-4.1391
Unhumour reigned with the residents , who , even with normal rains of thunderstorms , are suffering from overloading the channel network .	-10.2507
The administration is aware of the problem and the first steps have already been taken .	-3.6993
More frequently , however , it pointed out that the directives on Channel Systems are different from those for flood protection and this should not be mixed .	-4.9608
The municipality is obliged to interpret the Channel network in such a way that two or three years of rainy events could be countered .	-5.8349

Parents of a teenager from Georgia who died in a tragic accident believe in murder	-2.3868
Teenage parents , whose body was found in a cobbled ringement in the gym of his High School , are convinced that their son was murdered , explained the family lawyer on Thursday .	-5.2752
Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the U.S. state of Georgia was found in a standing mat behind the gallery in the school stadium on 11 January .	-5.4405
The Sheriff of Lownd County investigative officials concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , leaving the family of the 17-year-old open .	-4.8581
" They are convinced that their son was murdered , " Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacqueyn Johnson , told FoxNews.com.	-2.6914
They would never have believed that he died as the shepherd concluded .	-3.8881
“ They believe that there is no logic against the laws of physics as well as common sense , ” says Crump .	-3.9619
Instead , they are convinced that the truth is being wasted to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-3.8664
“ Her son went to school to learn and returned to the corpse , ” he commented .	-3.7812
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , as a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-3.8419
What was the cause of death ?	-0.6225
Is his death a crime ?	-1.0954
That said to Moore during a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-2.0065
I follow the facts in which direction they are heading .	-2.6743
My aim is to find out the truth .	-1.6096
“ I believe that there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.8261
Moore explained to reporters that the initial autopsy indicated that Johnson was doomed to the consequences of a “ position-related suffocation . ”	-4.1270
However , a second autopsy produced another cause of death , says Moore .	-3.5695
“ There are a number of questions that need to be answered or confirmed , ” he said .	-2.2327

CDC publish people with allergies in schools	-3.3506
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines on how children are treated with food allergies in schools .	-3.6227
These are the first such guidelines issued by the US government , as the number of school-dependent children with food allergies is rising .	-4.3743
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.5198
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.1419
The guidelines provide information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies at the classroom and staff and to deal with children who are allergic to reactions .	-5.4801
It is also recommended that schools have epinephrine in stock – the car injection of the epiPen brand is most commonly used – in order to address a potentially fatal hypersensitivity response .	-4.4526
Legislators in the states have recently changed the rules so that schools can easily keep epinephrine in stock .	-4.5561
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with an allergic reaction .	-2.9054
Children may say : “ It feels as if something is written on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels like a hair is lying on it , ” or “ my tongue stumbles . ”	-5.9623
Parents of intersex children can choose “ gender unmatched ”	-4.4937
Germany is the first European nation to recognize a third gender for children born with non-unique gendered people .	-3.6516
newborns are no longer assigned rigid male or female .	-3.4118
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare gender for such children , but can provide “ unmatched ” or “ not specified ” on the birth certificate .	-5.6333
The aim of the law is to take pressure from parents so that they do not have to make hasty decisions on operations for sexual consent in newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersex people .	-6.4043
According to the BBC , an intersex person said years later : “ I am neither a man nor a woman . ”	-2.9410
I remain the patchwork created by doctors , mutilated and scared .	-2.3994
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children every year will not be born either as a boy or as a girl .	-3.9394
They are among the intersexual , a group that falls under the diagnosis of “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collective term for people with atypical chromosomes , germs ( ovaries or hoods ) , or unusually developed genitals .	-6.1247
Wallis Simpson may have been intersex .	-2.2656
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US recommend that you use the best available sexual education information if a provision is not possible , rather than wait for the psychological and physical development of the child before deciding , if at all , for an operation .	-6.6785
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who has specialized in the issue of gender identification , said that the new German law “ rings for a good thing . ”	-4.2458
Intersexual children constitute an ethical dilemma .	-1.3143
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but this does not apply to most children , ” he said .	-2.8878
You can do a sexual education without surgery and then wait to see how the identity develops .	-5.4011
The scientific data on how a child develops its gender identity are not very accurate .	-4.6308
No one knows why it is .	-1.8315
It is like the secret why people are gay .	-1.7731
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersex people are different from transsexuals or transgenders , because their status is not gender-related , but due to their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-5.4574
These characteristics were shown in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , bandaging , breasts and stature , priority sexual characteristics such as reproduction organs and genitals , or chromosomes structures and hormones .	-5.2254
The report also provides an overview of discrimination affecting intersex and transgenders in professional life , as well as the extent of harassment , violence and prejudices .	-5.2091
Young people who do not agree with the gender picture now have a special camp .	-3.1231
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to refer to official documents male , female , or “ third sex . ”	-3.8822
In June , Norrie May-Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ gender love ” person after a court granted lifetime “ non-fixed ” sexual status .	-4.2517
In addition to M and W , German cards have a third assignment , X for intersex , says the Ministry of the Interior .	-5.4974
In neighboring France , sexual issues are still controversial , so a news report on France 24 .	-3.8723
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” be removed from school books .	-2.3708
The US website Catharic Online has also spoken out against German law , on the grounds that “ if the world is torn into a new state , where gender is a decision but not sexual activity , we will turn two other pillars of civilisation . ”	-6.8500
The mother of a newborn from Maryland told baby zone , she would find it better if babies were given a sex at birth .	-4.9931
“ The parent is already stretched enough without further restrictions , especially if you don ’ t know the sex of your own child , ” she said on the parent website .	-5.1353
Children need stability and security .	-0.5631
Historically , children born with both male and female genders were called Hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek god , who had both sexes .	-4.6158
Ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be eliminated and rebuilt .	-4.2533
But the ethical foundations of an operation are now being questioned , now that it is known how complex the gender identity is , and doctors can be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing with the sex they assign .	-6.1112
“ In the middle of the 20th century , one was called a psychiatric emergency , ” Drescher said .	-4.1731
When such a child was born , one did not call the psychiatrist , but the surgeons .	-2.9039
The dominant theory on the treatment of children with non-unique genders is based on Dr. John Money of Johns Hopkins University , who believed that gender was formable .	-5.7396
He coined the term “ gender identity , ” arguing that social and environmental preoccupations – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , thus shaping a person as male or female .	-4.3326
But , in a 1966 case known as “ John / Joan , ” his theories became controversial .	-2.5580
He told the parents of a boy whose penis had been cut off when circumcised , to orchestrate the child in full , and also to remove his trousers , and then to draw him up as a girl .	-7.8994
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of a conversion , but he was not , ” says Drescher .	-2.9206
When the boy was around 15 , he switched back to male sex and married a woman .	-2.8364
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-2.5907
According to Drescher , there are still doctors who would practice this model .	-2.6521
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the advent of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public , who are “ not happy with the result . ”	-3.7565
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36 year old author from Montana , born with XY-male chromosomes , but ambiguous genitals .	-4.1267
Doctors were not aware of whether he had a large clitorist or a small penis , and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfying life ” as a man .	-4.2692
So his external organ and the pants were removed surgical shortly after birth in 1976 and he was pulled up as a girl .	-5.5158
At the age of 12 he was given female hormones .	-1.9335
“ I knew I 'm not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com	-2.3269
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.6959
At the age of 18 he should get a vaginal load .	-2.6687
But since he was depressive and knew that something did not vote , he demanded his medical files .	-3.0581
What he found out was shocking .	-0.9345
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one ever told me that .	-2.4274
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterones to develop the genitals .	-3.7206
After learning the truth , he switched to a male identity , received testosterone injections , and allowed his breasts to be removed .	-4.6829
The surgery made it infertile .	-2.6400
Today he is fighting for others in an organization called Interface Project to see intersex people as normal .	-4.1462
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of the California legal group Advocates for Informed Choice , is worried that German law can “ stamp and encourage stigmatisation . ”	-6.7182
“ Many activists are worried that Germany ’ s decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions , and to admit to the child , ” she explained .	-5.1514
We fear that this benefits intervention .	-2.0553
We think it would be better to have male or female gender and then to wait .	-3.4000
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.4238
Tamar-Mattis said that her organization supports Australian law because “ it allows adults to recognize it as third sex . ”	-3.8664
“ adults should be able to make their own choices about their gender , ” she explained .	-3.1309
German law concerns the assignment at birth .	-2.1717
This is not a fight to which small children should be forced at this point .	-3.5572
If they are adults , they can decide their own bodies .	-3.1447
But Dr Arlene Barsatz , a thorny radiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with a sexual differentiation disorder and who supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says the German law “ accomplished ” both parents and children .	-4.6316
Katie , the daughter of Barsatz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete Androgen-resistance .	-3.5607
Katie developed female characteristics due to the receptor defect of target cells for testosterone .	-3.0460
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no ovaries .	-2.5598
Katie 29 and married today , working at the University of Pennsylvania as a child psychiatrist .	-4.5355
Although she is infertile , she hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-3.5858
“ The law provides room for parents , which does not require them to take hasty decisions , ” said Barz .	-4.8837
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things and gives them time before they write “ male ” or “ female ” .	-4.4267
In this way everything is fine – you pull the child large and love it .	-4.0977
You have a wonderful baby and you enjoy the happy parenthesis .	-4.4284
And you don ’ t have to hasten an operation that can no longer be rolled back .	-6.9606
“ That includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are killing because they think they are not doing the right thing , ” they explained .	-4.3315
In the end , the child decides on the gender that suits him better – and that is wonderful .	-4.2556
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-2.1248
Unknown girls Puzzle from Auto	-3.6923
Unknown persons injured a 12-year-old in Saxony-Anhalt when shaking from a car .	-4.4065
On Thursday evening , the perpetrators probably fired an air force on a group of children .	-3.0523
This was shared by the police in Burg .	-2.7328
The girl was easily injured on the left lane .	-3.0724
Savings brought the girl to the hospital .	-3.2377

The crime system was established on Friday .	-3.3657
Until now , police inspectorate Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-3.1189
The officials were only asked twice for children who were fighting house facades .	-7.3451
As homeowners realized this in good time and removed the eggs immediately , no material damage would have arisen .	-6.3685
In addition , several New Year ’ s Eve oil was ignited in the city , but no material damage was caused .	-6.9653
A member of the Bischof Freundorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped up with clothed paper and his wheels removed .	-6.3568
However , until the police arrived , the man found his wheeling problems in the immediate vicinity , so the police had to stop taking action .	-6.1224
Living with a Future perspective	-2.4982
In fact , Waltrad Ries lives dreamy .	-3.5206
Your house is located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with plenty of green , old trees , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-4.4790
The hotel is only a few minutes away by public transport .	-4.1836
" I hope you are not afraid of spiders ? " , asks Waltrad Ries and shows a fat spider on the door frame .	-6.0819
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and me for some time .	-2.2144
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-2.0446
However , the reason is not a phase of spin , but the concern that at age the many steps to the house and the apartment can no longer be overcome is explained .	-7.1269
In addition , since a menisus-operation the centralist has had to learn on his own body what it means to move with a handicap from a floor to a floor .	-6.2236
Only recently is a book published by her about ' Happiness living at age - Which form of living is the best for me ? ' .	-4.4726
'Our apartment is the best example of what does not happen at age ' , it begins to tell .	-4.4124
When she moved to the maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.9658
Today , with the middle of fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it .	-3.5983
But she also knows that she is one of the few people who deal with the subject of ' living at age ' .	-7.5510
Most people crowd it out as long as it goes .	-3.8098
Always old are only the others ' , they say cosy .	-4.5699
Only when the pressure of the skin is really great can you start thinking .	-5.5978
" Then it can be too late , " says Ries .	-2.8979
In her book , the interior designers presented 17 models of living for a separate age .	-5.2553
" Which form of living you choose is always an individual style , " she explains .	-4.3705
D i e solution do not exist for age .	-2.1675
Even those who can afford the retirement retirement in Tuscany or Brittany should always think that it can also become ill .	-4.7583
And : ' Without a good knowledge of the language of the country , people are united in the Dolce Vita , ' gives the authors of the book permission to consider .	-8.5418
Among their models are classic care models , alternative forms of living or the often quoted renter WG .	-4.5695
At Age everyone has so his ticks and Macks	-4.2052
" For me such a congregation would be nothing , " she says with an eyelid .	-6.3771
Just like in a student WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-4.2482
" At old age you simply need your retreat rooms , " says Ries .	-4.9093
Nevertheless , the authors do not want to rule out the fact that a senior resident community can still function .	-4.1421
But that should then be different from that of the classic student WG .	-6.0023
And sometimes you just want his calm , " she believes .	-3.6504
At least in the provincial capital , it is not alone .	-6.4691
'Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own home for as long as possible ' is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil services life at the age of the provincial capital .	-4.9427
Your office advises people about becoming older .	-3.0750
This is why older people in particular would often also take advantage of inconvenience and restrictions to stay in their usual environment , which is also the experience of the Foundation Warnings Test .	-6.6501
Today there are many ways to make your house or apartment accessible .	-4.3812
It is a good idea for all those who are concerned with the ageing of their house or apartment to get informed and not to hire the best craftsman .	-8.1430
Today , we also offer custom made renovation specialists .	-7.2627
Even in the rented apartment it is possible to realise one thing or another , and if it is only the increase in toilet seat , the interior architects clarify this .	-6.9121
But it is not always possible to change the existing flat from an old age to a more accessible one , even if it is still so beautiful .	-6.4428
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries .	-3.1362
Although you could install a staircase inside the apartment , the road also paved with stairs to the door of the apartment would be a far greater obstacle .	-6.7177
She will continue searching until she finds the ideal object for herself and her husband .	-2.3779
Before moving it greets her more than before the spider on her home door .	-4.0880
The US wants to continue persecuting Snowden	-2.2293
The US has not changed its stance on former US intelligence officer Edward Snowden .	-2.4355
He is still accused of having passed secret information unlawfully .	-4.3490
So he must face a criminal case in the US , said the spokeswoman of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki in Washington .	-4.0285
The recent statements by Snowden would not change this either .	-2.7833
Previously , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , Germany ’ s Green politician , Hans-Christian Ströbele had appealed to the US not to threaten it further with punishment .	-5.2839
Psaki stressed that flow statements are those of a parliamentarian , rather than that of a German member of the government .	-7.6328
The secret service provider Edward Snowden is in principle willing to talk to German authorities .	-5.2825
But first he wants to clarify his situation .	-2.7218
This was made clear by the former NSA staff sought by the US in an unaddressed letter , which was published by Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and led by the Federal Government , the Bundestag and the Federal Advocate .	-7.5286
The letter follows a translation that is widely used by Current :	-5.5764
The Responsible	-2.8299
I have been asked to write to you about your mass monitoring inquiry .	-2.1080
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously engaged in contract or direct employment as a technical expert on the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-4.4276
During my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic violations of my government ’ s laws , which led me to take action on a moral level .	-4.9992
As a result of the publication of these concerns , I saw myself exposed to a serious and ongoing support that forced me to leave my family and home .	-5.4521
I currently live in exile and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation under international law .	-1.7604
I am encouraged by the response to my political action , both in the US and elsewhere .	-2.1733
Citizens around the world , as well as senior officials - including the United States - have judged the revelations of a comprehensive surveillance system that is accountable to nobody as a service to the public .	-4.4806
These spy revelations resulted in many proposals for new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public trust .	-3.8544
The benefits to society from these knowledge are becoming increasingly clear , while at the same time the risks that were purchased have been visibly reduced .	-6.2992
Although the outcome of my efforts has been proven to be positive , my government continues to treat dissent as a fiduciary and seeks to criminalise and indict political expression .	-6.0679
Nevertheless , the truth is not a crime .	-2.0289
I am confident that the United States Government , with the support of the international community , will adopt this intolerable attitude .	-3.7883
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to contribute appropriately and legally to the responsible clarification of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-5.3083
I look forward to talking to you in your country as soon as the situation is resolved and thank you for your efforts to uphold international law , which protects us all .	-3.9290

Kindergarten has found a private buyer	-1.6722
" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlingen Mayor Michael Maier .	-1.4887
The former kindergarten in the garden street sold the Commune to a private person .	-3.4792
The local council agreed to the sale in its recent meeting in the non-public part .	-4.8304
The building changed its owner to a " reasonable " price .	-2.1008
" The municipality is satisfied " , says Maier .	-2.2840

Report : Obama ’ s campaign to replace Biden with Hillary Clinton	-2.2692
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers , in secret , considered replacing Vice President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in 2012 , says the New York Times .	-3.1672
The revelation is the most remarkable surprise of Mark Halperin and John Heiemann ’ s long-awaited work on the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 ” .	-3.8978
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and they reported on Thursday evening that the president ’ s top advisers “ had conducted extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 , ” to determine whether it would be better for Obama ’ s diminishing hope of re-election if he left Biden .	-5.7111
According to Jonathan Martin , the Times ’ national correspondent , the book thoroughly illustrates the history of the campaign ’ s and White House ’ s efforts to measure , notably former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , the effect of exchanging former Secretary of State Clinton for the Vice-President .	-5.8212
Potential change was a strictly guarded secret in the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and Oval Office .	-2.5244
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , the former campaign leader Obama , Jim Messina , and the White House ’ s former chief adviser , David Axelrod , and David Plouffe – knew about the planned change .	-4.2653
In “ Double Down , ” it is claimed that Daley has been at the forefront of efforts to exchange Biden , despite her “ close , personal relationship , ” before deciding to take such a move , after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.8261
In an interview with Martin Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-2.2119
“ I expressed a whole range of things that should be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley told the magazine .	-3.2751
We must remember that the president had terrible poll values at the time , so we thought : “ To God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-4.4058
While Daley referred to the investigations as “ due diligence , ” Martin compared to Anderson Cooper of CNN said that considerable effort had been made during the campaign for re-election to find out whether such a move would pay for the ballot box .	-5.7245
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups if you don ’ t think about something seriously , ” said Martin on AC360 .	-4.3671
But it is not clear whether Obama knew his team was thinking about exchange .	-2.5321
Martin told CNN that he asked Daley if his previous boss knew about the potential change .	-2.5533
Although Daley explained that he did not believe that the president was “ aware of the possible change , ” the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” for Obama to know .	-3.9933
Martin added that “ Double Down ” does not provide a definitive answer to the question of whether Obama ’ s political explorers ’ desk had reached .	-3.9383
Cooper asked Martin if he really thought Obama did not know anything about whether Biden should be allowed to drop in the elections .	-4.2127
" Possibly " Martin replied .	-2.1043
What happens to my email ?	-1.8209
E-mail actually means an electronic letter .	-1.4077
Was the design of the Internet service email similar to that of the conventional mail service implemented the confidentiality of letters ?	-6.9618
The concept of early Internet services was mainly aimed at making communication possible .	-3.8337
Therefore , the basic technical protocols were not designed to provide a stable basis for an informed exchange of letters .	-4.7529
Therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-2.7815
If user " Anna " sent an e-mail to " Benni " , are the computers of the two then directly connected ?	-3.5556
Anna 's email program or browser sends the mail to the e-mail server of her service provider in the first step .	-3.7208
For example , if it has a GM account , it would be Google .	-2.9161
This mail server sends the content to the provider that Benni uses .	-2.6071
On the way the mail can run via several other servers on the Internet .	-4.2046
Bennie can call the content from his provider .	-3.3765
Will conventional e-mails be read on their way through the net ?	-3.1608
Most mails are read by software robots on the move .	-2.4949
The sender 's provider usually checks whether the mail contains a malicious program as an attachment .	-3.8917
A virus check is also made on the receiver systems .	-2.4103
In addition , providers check whether this is a annoying and unwanted spam mail that is immediately deleted or at least sorted out in a spam folder .	-5.3687
Do the robots have another task ?	-1.3599
In systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-3.2619
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their coming holidays , Google may link to holiday offers .	-4.4509
Do unknown people also read the mails ?	-3.0650
The probability that unauthorised persons read a mail is extremely low .	-3.6408
In theory this is possible .	-2.2113
In companies administrators often have the ability to read electronic mail .	-3.0605
The law enforcement authorities and secret services also have legal means of intercepting or recording emails .	-3.9179
There are possible illegal interception actions .	-4.2571
Is it possible to protect e-mails against interception ?	-3.8072
An email can be effectively encrypted against co-reading using the OpenPGP standard .	-3.7497
It is also possible to obscure the meta data of an e-mail communication , so that it is not even easy to see who has communicated with whom .	-5.7700
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-2.0060
Yahoo and Google , according to a survey by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , play a minor role in the mail boxes that are mainly used privately .	-4.6912
While the shares of Yahoo Mail had recently fallen , GMail from Google could clearly increase .	-4.2355
Mother in the Forest Slaloge and Recreation Collect	-7.1174
When his prayed mother died , a man from Wolfsburg created a plan .	-1.9795
He claimed the deaths in a forest - and continued to receive their pension and care money .	-4.8455
A 67-year-old Wolfsburger has buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations .	-3.9956
First of all , he had postponed the death of the 89-year-old , then he had cut the money for more than a year and a half .	-5.6965
Now the 67-year-old has to answer for fraud , as a speaker said on Friday .	-3.3576
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-2.5879
The man was already suspected in May : At that time , it transpired that the needy mother no longer needed medicines .	-5.4729
Pensioners told the investigators that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-1.9929
Because the official found this strange , they continued to detect it .	-4.1117
It was discovered that the two had lived in a common apartment for more than 15 years and that he had recently maintained it .	-5.5574
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-1.6580
According to the police , a police record did not show any evidence of a capital crime .	-5.1167
Fancy ice cream shining in the dark ?	-3.2740
A British entrepreneur has created the first glowing ice – with agony .	-5.1907
Charlie Francis took advantage of the water-bearing properties of marine animals and created a shining glowing .	-5.3302
The idea came to him after reading a research on skills , and convinced Chinese scientists to artificially produce the shining protein .	-4.8340
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when consuming , increasing the pH in the protein and releasing the light .	-4.8403
Chris explains that the ice cream reacted to the warmth of the mouth and lit – the more you lick , the lighter it gets .	-4.5174
Charlie , founder of the ice cream company “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious ” , says : “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.8987
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue with a neutral pH value .	-2.2351
When the mouth warms the protein , the pH and the ice light up .	-3.6325
We have tested it in recent months and it seems to us ideal to put it on the market at Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-4.2437
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced , because the high light material is four times more expensive than gold .	-3.4956
Each bullet costs me about 140 pounds .	-2.4811
But for that it tastes delicious .	-2.1509
Charming experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual tastes , including beer , cheese , beef and sheet gold .	-3.8053
But his latest creation should become even more ambitious .	-2.1082
He says : ‘ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ’	-2.3676
This is , in itself , impossible because of the refractory caused by the ice crystals consisting of ice cream ; but I suspect we find a way of doing it .	-6.0974
Ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a quality artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-2.4102
TSV Morsum is still in the Handball League League after six days of play .	-4.3317
The team of Ingo Ehler will now be responsible for the derby against TSV Dad , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-6.3801
With this game the season starts new for us .	-2.6104
" I hope that we will finally have our head free , " Ehlers behave optimistically .	-4.6999
At last , apart from the permanent injured Hendrik Blohm , he has made his complete cadre available .	-6.5128
Daverde is like we are on Tempos .	-6.1635
We therefore need to keep our error rate low .	-2.7345
But first of all we need to increase our cover , which has left everything but a certain impression .	-6.4296
Daverdens coach Thomas Panitz is much more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-3.7271
The game was of course a house number .	-1.4657
But for this reason we are not the favourite , because everything can always happen in the derby .	-4.3012
However , Panitz now wants to pause in Moresum to start a series .	-4.6579
Her absence will be Jan-Malte Jodat .	-2.9156
For this purpose the A-youngsters Joost Windmill , who is active with double play rights at the HC Bremen A-Jugend-Beiligist , celebrates its season .	-8.3723
If you are not so hot in such a game , you should stay at home .	-4.6935
Halloween 2013 : In Figures	-0.7450
When I was small , Halloween had some magic .	-1.6578
My sister and I were permitted to eat sweets , leave late and sue us for the neighbourhood .	-3.1047
Today I have become a Halloween Muffel .	-2.7705
In the last two years I have not agreed to distribute from my apartment of candy , and I will probably not do so this year .	-4.7360
But , according to statistics , I am a black sheep in respect of Halloween .	-2.2655
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – are celebrating Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion in sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Association of retailers ( NRF ) .	-4.3217
One thing I am looking forward to from every Halloween is the trend values .	-4.6418
The costumes will comprise about 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , the NRF .	-3.6305
In this year , unlived objects are the last cry .	-4.1003
Women no longer need to dress in sexy clothing , they can now embody tempting food such as pizza , hamburgers , or carrots .	-4.5685
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft Punk widebands will make it into the Instagram Feeds this year .	-5.6597
According to Google , the most sought costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.4758
I suspect there is nothing wrong with tradition .	-1.6074
Last year we dressed our dogs and were not alone in my amazement .	-3.3358
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on domestic animals ’ costumes , the NRF says .	-4.0919
This is a lot of hot dogs .	-2.3721
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not zimperlich . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.2851
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , according to The Nielsen Company .	-1.2714
These are about 270 million kilograms of coribles , microbes , candies and rubber balls .	-4.9507
So good news for the 41 million people who , according to the US Department of Commerce , are pulling through the quarter with the slogan “ sweet or sour ” .	-5.8112
In fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not pretend – eat it .	-4.2100
The only thing we do not want to consume is Candy Corn , which is sugar-sweet , yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , the National Association of Soft Producers .	-6.1562
That is about nine billion grains of maize .	-2.3756
It is a mystery that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.6016
Nothing belongs more to Halloween than houses where it thrives .	-2.3743
They have great names such as “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which is in fact a real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock ” .	-3.6409
There are , in fact , 1,200 officially recognised splukhouses in the United States , which generate $ 500 million in revenue , America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photos on which you just place yourself in the hop and friends on Facebook , where you will not get rid of them again , and one then the type on which you stand leaves a comment like “ net facial expression . ”	-8.3687
But finally we come to the kiss .	-3.3818
Charlie Brown familiarised us with the Great Kürbis when we were children , and cutting a pumpkin is like the dusk of the Christmas tree – something we made from small to small .	-5.7478
Fortunately , the “ baby in the Kürbis ” trend started only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us have grown up to cook the pumpkin and not to sit in it .	-5.2043
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on Kürbisse , as the US Census Bureau .	-4.1383
The pumpkin , which slowly rotates into the front garden , is presumably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin were harvested this year .	-7.7060
If you want to score correctly , call Tim and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and carve some bitches from their 921 kilo heavy purbis .	-5.0954
Hours of fire in Helmet Rights : Resilistolen .	-7.7097
The fire brigade had to move out on Thursday evening in Helmsburg .	-4.7826
A three-family house in the county of Hof starts fire at night on Friday .	-5.0427
The rescue forces have a stolen body from the house .	-2.3160
In the event of a fire on the helmet right , rescue forces found a stolen body in a three-family house .	-5.5620
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-4.6688
On the late Thursday evening it had burned on the ground floor of the house .	-3.0424
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames were already coming out of a window .	-3.2061
The staff went to the apartment and found the bodies in a room .	-2.9145
This and another room burned out completely .	-3.0904
The whole ground floor has been damaged .	-2.0561
All other residents were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued .	-3.9838
The building is not habitable for the moment .	-4.0355
The exact cause of the fire was initially not clear .	-1.7166
Germany ’ s largest national church has launched an offensive to promote the profession of the pastor .	-2.7243
Background is a possible pastor fishing : The evangelical Lutheran National Church in Hanover estimates that the number of its currently 1,800 pastors and pastors will halve by 2030 .	-6.2752
For today ’ s young people , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) speaking with the evangelical press service .	-5.4113
It is attractive to be able to determine the schedule of work and the schedule itself .	-4.5752
For the first time , Burfien has commissioned a Pastor to inspire young people to study theology .	-4.3271
At present , less and less young people decide to study theology after secondary school .	-3.4286
Burfien leads this back to the process of de-ecclesification : " God 's voice is silent , the world is loud " .	-3.7836
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.8801
I am Mr President of my calendar and can set my priorities where it is important to me .	-3.7395
Pastors may be close to people as a carer .	-3.5654
They earned as much as teachers and could live well .	-2.2527
Of course , there is more to pay in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer .	-4.9824
This goes to the young people of today , who are not just about careers , but about a decent job .	-5.8462
According to the National Church , which comprises three quarters of Lower Saxony , around 60 Pastors are currently retiring each year .	-4.2891
At the same time , about 40 graduates of a theology degree start their vikariat .	-3.8997
In the future , it will be difficult to fill jobs in sparsely populated peripheral areas such as the resin , the Emsland or the Wendland .	-4.6629
Burfien wants to organise , among other things , study days for young people and invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-5.5334
Theology studies offer broad education .	-3.7786
It is even possible to become President of .	-3.2169
Land Rover Rally Series announced	-0.2892
In the interior there are racing seats and six-point belts as well as a free-range facility .	-4.6394
The options range from enhanced brakes , a service package with the support of Bowler Works-Mechanics and logistical support , to vehicle storage between events .	-5.6649
Drew Bowler , CEO of Bowler Motorsport , said : “ The Rally customers who come to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.8763
They are not all experienced riders , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure , as well as an achievable way to world class events .	-4.7143
We are delighted to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and the MSA and believe that the format opens up new possibilities to experience the different Rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and prepare new entrants for the hardships and the reality of Rally Raid .	-8.2474
We had really fun developing the Defender Challenge car – a passionate mastery .	-3.9444
In addition , the Defender Challenge offers a training and test day in February and an option to participate in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-4.2802
Fire brigade to rescue a hill that stuck in a quarry 15 meters above the ground on a dangerous rock .	-4.7203
After a small traffic accident , half half of the cabin went away .	-6.2703
Three days later it was discovered by a walker in the quarry in her predicament .	-3.4550
Fire-fighters left on a rock wall and rescued the dog from the safe death	-5.1301
The fire brigade was able to secure a female guard who was stuck in a rock wall on a 15-metre high edge .	-5.9380
After a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon , the nine months old Cock paniel Hündin Ruby survived for three days alone before being rescued from a quarry on Wednesday .	-7.4512
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 , who belongs to the dog , came to the Flappit quarry in Denholme , West Yorkshire to receive Ruby and thank the firemen of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-4.6724
They were desperate to look for their missing bitch and published requests for help in social networks when they had perished from the small traffic accident in the quarry .	-7.0575
About 14 : 15 a.m. on Wednesday , a walker carrying out his dog saw the stranded Ruby on the 15m high paragraph in the quarry .	-6.7362
The technical rescue team at the Cleckheaton Fire Station rushed to the site and was then rescued by Rubys in a dog box .	-7.1743
Andy Clayton , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ She was in a dangerous situation .	-2.3070
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from the top and the bottom .	-2.7702
She did not move any muscle during her rescue – she was as stiff as she was . , , , , , , and . , ,	-5.2333
But now she is doing well .	-2.2910
She then picked up some dog cakes .	-3.2071
That was quite an unusual undertaking .	-3.5607
The fact that the dog has been discovered is incredible .	-1.5080
Peter Lau , specialist in the technical rescue team , said : “ Ruby had a huge success . ”	-2.8722
It was possible that it was severely injured or worse .	-3.0030
Ruby was brought to the veterinary examination , but it did not reveal anything except exhaustion and dehydration .	-5.3007
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ The rescue was frightening . ”	-4.6364
I could not even think she was really there .	-3.4160
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-1.9038
The veterinarian said that if exhaustion had become too large and it would have collapsed , it would probably have collapsed .	-4.4154
The fire fighters have done great things .	-2.1680
What they did was truly brave .	-3.3063
We are simply so grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.1958
Scott Alderson from Keighley added , “ We were afraid that it would fall , but it remained above . ”	-3.8058
The fire fighters were great .	-1.7056
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.4061
Mick Jagger explains that he never registered Katy Perry when she was 18 .	-2.1022
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop star said she was working as a backgroup singer on Jagger 's song " Old Habits Die Hard " from 2004 .	-5.1636
Perry said she had dinner with the alchemist , and that “ he gave me when I was 18 . ”	-4.2782
She added : “ This has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me . ”	-2.5532
In a statement , a representative Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he had ever attempted to make advances with Katy Perry . ”	-4.4800
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.4292
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance during the Rolling Stones tour this year .	-2.2359
Her new album “ Prism ” landed on first this week .	-4.6289
George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the choice .	-5.1151
A new day , a new history of terror about independence .	-1.8410
This time , we are being warned that an independent Scotland is required to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.0591
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a border along the Hadrian walls , secured with barbed wire .	-4.4770
Indeed , the Strathclyde proposal drew attention to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but it did not – expected – headlines in the headlines .	-5.8193
Nor did anyone mention that EU member states often bend their strict rules when it is more favorable for them .	-5.1819
As Scotland is not currently part of the Schengen area , continuing non-compliance for Brussels would be a small concession in exchange for what the Scots really want .	-4.7492
So no story .	-2.4619
And one that has already happened in the years that it is already like a fossil : the first time I heard “ independence means passport controls ” -duck at least 40 years ago .	-5.3939
An interesting point is lost in constantly repeating this ancient story .	-3.2377
Why should we expect an independent Scotland to dance according to the European ?	-3.8479
Why exchange the London yoke for Brussels , especially now ?	-2.8506
These are the real European news : the great post-war plan for the unification of Europe has stalled .	-2.7783
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-1.8654
Across the EU , parties who are hostile to the EU or who want to overboard the euro as a common currency are gaining ground .	-3.4002
Even in Germany , the eurosceptic Alternative für Deutschland – founded only this year – had won almost five million votes in the September general election , effectively driving the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-5.4274
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federal Europe .	-1.8548
The current economic crisis , however , turns out to be a turning point .	-1.4957
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank , together with the straitjacket in which the respective national economy is forced by holding onto the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.7652
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments creating excessive budget deficits – only in Greece .	-2.7616
Instead , the euro system has kept its members on exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and German policymakers would like to do so .	-4.6382
Without the possibility of devaluation of the local currency , Southern Europe will find itself with an integrated productivity disadvantage vis-à-vis Germany .	-4.0639
The only way is to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.0894
Behind the current budgetary and monetary problems lies a deeper European productivity problem .	-1.9943
As a result of the “ green ” energy guidelines imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidizing French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice for electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.1156
This is a stifling cost component , as we have seen in Grangemouth .	-6.3721
All world wage fixing does not protect the European petrochemical industry from being squeezed into the corner from cheap American shale gas .	-7.5616
As a result , a revolt draws up , especially in France , the EU ’ s former cheerleader .	-3.6920
After the war , France ’ s political elite regarded the EU as a vehicle for keeping Germany in check and raising Paris on an equal footing with Washington .	-2.7305
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe down its own economic policies , thereby confronting the struggling French economy .	-4.1038
The result : Marine Le Pen ’ s far-right , anti-EU Front National has just won a critical reelection , thereby pointing the ruling socialists to three .	-5.7543
The National Front is now France ’ s most popular party , with 24 % of the vote – a timely warning to the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that right-hand division would automatically benefit the left .	-5.1180
What is Le Pen doing with her new popularity among the white French of the working class ?	-2.6510
She wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-Community monetary bloc in the European Parliament .	-3.1699
If anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and that is very possible – such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament for the first time .	-4.1996
That is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the common currency will come together to abolish the euro .	-4.2917
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something more like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” favored by General de Gaulle .	-2.5329
Germany and a few of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro , but France and southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.6194
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of getting on with the US .	-3.6501
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain will be alone in Atlantic rain .	-2.1939
Where is Scotland going on in all this ?	-2.4450
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-2.4724
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including to say in Berlin and Brussels what they can get to where .	-4.2891
I suspect that Scotland could well drive in a loose European union if we retain our own currency .	-4.5642
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in a non-federal Europe of nations .	-2.3139
Otherwise , we should consider treating Norway equally and maintaining our economic independence .	-3.0796
The SNP government in Scotland is – surprisingly – the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe , and won a spectacular majority in 2011 , owing to the rejection of the proposed ( and anticipated ) cuts that Labour Finance Minister Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory-Lib Dem-coalition had to answer .	-9.6916
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to opt for independence now only to have austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .	-3.5015
Early Puberty : Grown Speed	-3.0703
Afro-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white ages , as studies show .	-2.4032
Physical changes do not immediately mean puberty .	-2.6187
There is no evidence that hormones or other chemicals are responsible .	-1.5026
Experts believe that epidemiological obesity is the catalyst for early puberty .	-2.4376
The Trend to Early Puberty is less pronounced among boys	-3.6325
The former CNN correspondent Pat Etherridge is a journalist specializing in child health and family issues .	-3.1306
Should a mother be worried if her daughter is already growing breasts and shamhairs at the age of seven or eight ?	-3.7524
At the annual Conference of the Children ’ s Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the paediatrician endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplovice explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and presented a new standard .	-4.7524
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – usually this is no sign that the puberty is now fast coming up , ” Kaplovice explained .	-6.4464
Obvious indications of development , such as growing breasts , Sham and Achselhaare as well as body commands , are shown earlier in girls .	-6.3135
However , there was only a slight shift at the age of the menarch ( behaviour of the first rule bleeding ) in the last 40 years .	-5.3017
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.5422
“ When the development of the breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to menarch , ” Kaplovice said , also author of the book “ Early Puberty in girls : The essential counselor to deal with this frequently occurring problem ” .	-5.2594
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-2.3688
It is controversial , which is indeed the beginning of puberty , but it is “ premature ” if the enlargement of the breast is accompanied by a growth delay of eight years ago .	-5.1603
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something that a pediatrician can closely monitor .	-3.1175
If faster progress is made , tests could be shown by an endikronologist to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts .	-5.7437
There are treatments that delay an early menstruation and the defenses of another consequence : premature aging of the bones , which can ultimately lead to an impediment to growth and thus small body growth in adults .	-6.9215
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the rate of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .	-3.4494
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-2.0032
Kaplovice is timid about drugs , but it admits : “ The oppressing of puberty can alleviate behavioral problems and girls ’ feelings , unlike their senses of age . ”	-5.9583
The other big problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.6151
“ They care about abortion risk or how they handle the hygienic side , ” Kaplovwitz said .	-4.9970
“ It was a shock , ” a woman whose daughter got her days with ten .	-2.6240
Although there were initial signs and we had talked about menstruation , it was emotionally unprepared .	-5.4041
She came anguish and excited from school , because she was the first in her circle of friends .	-4.0795
There are many extensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-2.1799
But there is no conclusive evidence that hormones in milk or other foods , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media would be the origin .	-4.1572
Young people , like girls in the past , get into puberty .	-3.6015
Kaplovice believes that the most convincing premise is the obesity epidemic .	-2.4328
He supported the implementation of a 2001 study on girls aged between six and nine , establishing a relationship between body fat and entry into puberty .	-4.7436
Other studies support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that have a role .	-2.2404
In that country , African-American and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white ages .	-2.5202
There are different explanations for this .	-1.9300
Globally , early puberty seems to be affected by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-3.1017
Another puzzling : Although boys have grown their face and shame earlier , the trend toward a full-size former puberty is not as strong as girls .	-5.6748
Other doctors at the AAP conference underlined the complexity of the topic .	-1.9615
The appearance of acne and shamhair is common even in babies and infants .	-2.9574
“ We must be careful how we identify the true beginning of puberty , ” said Dr Lawrence Silverman , a pediatric endocrinologist at the Goryeb Children 's Hospital in Morristown , New Jersey .	-3.4521
Parents should not hesitate to ask their pediatrician how they should talk to their child .	-2.7751
“ This can mean that you have to have a conversation earlier than expected , ” Kaplovice advised .	-4.9169
If you stay calm , the child usually reacts well .	-3.0371
Girls who bloom early need the insurance that the process is a normal part of life , even if it occurs earlier than expected .	-4.7080
Jumbo manufacturers argue over chairs in the face of large orders .	-2.5938
There has been a discussion among leading aircraft manufacturers about the breadth of long-haul seats in the tourist class , which sets the tone for a bitter collision at the Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.8422
The dispute revolves around the width of seats that passengers are offered on long journeys in the tourist class – not always the ones who make the most effort by airlines , but this outstanding area is the key to the efficiency of the latest aircraft of Airbus SAS and Boeing Co. .	-7.2110
This week , Airbus called for an industry standard requiring at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the American archrival Boeing says that it should be the airlines who decide .	-6.0794
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-range pilots and are expecting record orders at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-5.6255
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially if there are rows with nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the stated economic results that the new “ mini-jumbo ” design will deliver .	-5.2238
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 77X ” version 406 seats in the tourist class , which is more than 17 inches wide , allowing 10 per row .	-5.6981
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 will host 350 people in 18 inch wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-4.0552
Aircraft giants often convey information about technical details through advertising in the trade press .	-3.9689
Now Airbus appeals directly to the public at the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X is expected to race with more than 100 orders .	-4.0700
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new ad war , showing donors a picture of holding three people together in a restaurant , with the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.8409
“ Boeing proposes long haul flights in seats that are closer to regional turbo routes , ” says Airbus Sales Director John Leahy .	-4.0354
People become thicker in the face of changes in eating habits , but aircraft seats have not changed radically .	-3.5277
Between the early 1970s , when the 747 defined the modern long-range journey , and by the end of the century , the male average American weight increased by 10 % between 40 and 49 years , according to the US Department of Health .	-7.5312
According to U.S. health statistics , the size of the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm .	-3.3966
Airbus says its rival was a seat concept from the 1950s , when the average body range of the newly exchanged “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-5.3137
According to Airbus , studies have shown that an additional tariff ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increases sleeping quality by 53 percent .	-4.1249
Boeing denies the Airbus figures to the size of the seats and says that it is not at the discretion of the manufacturers to decide how airlines manage the balance between fares and equipment .	-6.5972
The company also explains that , according to studies , the aeroplane experience depends on more than the seat width .	-3.6957
“ It really is about giving airlines flexibility to do what they think they need to succeed , ” explains the airline expert Kent Craver of Boeing .	-4.6089
They do not want us to dictate to them what makes them profitable .	-1.2928
They know their business better than anyone else .	-1.3291
For passengers , there is a need for greater freedom of movement of elbows , but for manufacturers it is becoming increasingly an issue which can have an impact on sales . are , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.9390
Behind the debate is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion at catalogue prices in the coming decades , which could have a lasting impact on US or European exports .	-4.7809
As Reuters first reported in July , the seating arrangement is the driving force behind the battle over the new jets .	-2.6651
Both Airbus and Boeing maintain 20 percent more efficiency per seat for their latest two-engine long-range designs as the market leader in this segment , the 365-seater Boeing 77-300ER .	-4.2116
The statements made by Boeing on the results partly depend on the comparison of 77X with its ten seats per row with the original design of nine seats in 777 .	-4.7386
Increased costs per unit are still lower than in currently used machines with ten seats per row .	-2.8386
“ Boeing is thus adding more seats on its aircraft to make it more competitive with our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of passenger comfort at European Airbus .	-4.5382
On the other hand , analysts say that full cabins with ten seats per row for 777s indicated that many passengers decided to lower the order , with cheaper fares .	-5.6622
“ Eighty inches of seat width would be great for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is governed by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , an expert for cabin furnishings , founder and editor of Runway Girl Network .	-6.0770
Airbus and Boeing are not offering seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which the airlines can choose .	-3.4385
The world ’ s travelling jet sales agents even carry the band ’ s weight in order to compete .	-9.0608
Even if they are priced for comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compacted design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-5.7318
Airbus offers a A350 of ten seats , but it has not sold any of them .	-6.4553
Until recently , Airbus has emphasised the importance of making the cabins more adaptable and offering large gears seats .	-5.6635
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the reputation for a new industry standard is likely to evaporate , but could distract from the wave of 77X sales .	-4.3436
New anti-nicotine vaccine could make the pleasure of smoking a damp .	-4.1979
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could ruin the fun of smoking .	-2.4106
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine for a lifetime .	-2.5417
Before human tests , more experiments are needed , which may take several years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said the first results are good .	-4.6635
“ We are very hopeful that this type of vaccination strategy can help millions of smokers who have tried to stop and have tried all available methods on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” says Cornell .	-4.5407
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus , which has been changed to include genetic information on the manufacture of nicotine antibodies .	-3.2449
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent stream of antibodies .	-1.8303
The antibodies chase the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , which means that a smokers do not get a nicotine high .	-4.0651
In trials , vaccinated mice that Nikotin was given their normal level of activity .	-4.7124
By contrast , the mice without vaccination had “ taken off , ” the researchers explained a sign that the nicotine had reached their brains .	-5.3231
The experiments are described in the journal Science Translational Medicine .	-2.0997
Previous tobacco vaccinations failed because they contained antibodies .	-2.3633
The vaccination had to be given so often to maintain the antibody tone that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.5881
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably far lower , because it turns liver cells into antibody factories .	-3.3736
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is safe , could be administered to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette and thus prevent nicotine addiction .	-7.9673
But it 's more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-3.7729
“ You know : When they start smoking again , they no longer feel comfortable because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to break the habit , ” he explains .	-6.3870
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.9300
Tripoli denies to have been influenced by Obeid . and . , , , , , , ,	-4.2929
The former laboratory minister Joe Tridoi of New South Wales is investigating corruption by state authorities .	-4.9509
The former NSW minister denies that he had changed the rules on the allocation of Maritimes at the request of his political mentor Eddie Obeid , who had hidden holdings in three plots on state-controlled land .	-7.0715
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC <unk> Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into the question of whether Obeid has influenced various state ministers to extend pacts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeids operated two restaurants and a café , without tendering after their expiry in August 2005 .	-5.8998
Now , because of the indictment , Triodi knew full interest in the properties revealed by Obeids , after Triodis 's previous deputy chief chief , Lynne AshPole , had announced on Thursday .	-8.7267
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tender for the lease contracts .	-3.5212
The breeders were opposed to this and also wanted longer running times .	-4.6375
In 2009 , the lease contracts for companies at the Circular Quay , which delivered $ 2.5 million annually to the Obeids , were extended without public tender .	-3.8001
Tripadi , who was Minister of the Port of February 2006 to November 2009 , originally argued for public procurement .	-6.9009
But he disputed having made changes to Obeid ’ s requests , which , as Triodi confirmed , had pushed for a change of government ’ s leased rules .	-6.3542
One of the telephone records submitted to the ICAC was talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Triodi and Steve Dunn , a senior official who was moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fishing authority .	-5.6091
“ Was the subject discussed in these telephone conversations the drawing up of commercial settlement arrangements ? ” asked the deputy Commissioner , Anthony Whealy Triodi .	-4.5318
“ No , ” Tripoli replied .	-2.6960
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-1.9092
There is no distinction between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.4542
Israeli fighter jets target Syria , according to official sources .	-2.9414
Israeli fighter jets would have attacked a target in the Syrian port of Latakia , confirming a senior government official to Fox News .	-6.5784
The official did not explain what the objective was , but said it was at least one .	-2.8275
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-3.4337
At least twice this year , Israel has already conducted air strikes on missile supplies in Syria .	-2.4859
Foreign workers with 457 visas could be subjected to a “ Authenticity Test ”	-3.6491
The government is considering extending measures to “ validate ” foreign workers with a 457 visa .	-4.3098
If the test were to be introduced , it would be used by means of a criterion that would prevent the 457 being used for occupation of unskilled jobs or as a back door for family and friends to Australia .	-6.7899
Today , a government discussion proposal was published after the former members of the laboratory party , Maxime McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be regarded as an insult by Australia ’ s neighbors .	-5.4268
“ Loud explanations like that foreigners should backfire — and , Australians first stop — are a very unpleasant setback in times when labor unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she told the Australian India Institute today .	-6.7356
Historically , that said that white workers should be protected – and if some in the region heeded an echo of this historical artefact , I would not be surprised .	-4.6175
The proposal for discussion outlines 12 measures that were once thought up by former immigration minister Chris Bowen .	-4.2240
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who visited talks yesterday about human trafficking in Sri Lanka , implemented five of the recommended changes , while others are still considering .	-4.3452
If the “ Authenticity Criterion ” is adopted , someone requesting a visa could be asked to check whether “ the application is correct in cases where the applicant is related to or personally linked to the owner or a relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-7.5057
Companies could also be forced to account for the number of 457 visa holders , after , in the past , companies that initially wanted to support only a small number of workers have finally abandoned hundreds .	-4.8436
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan refugee died of heart attack after he arrived this week with a boat of refugees on the Christmas island .	-5.6414
Since the death of his father on Wednesday , an adult cousin , who was also on board , has been responsible for the adulterated nine-year-old son of the man who had come to Australia with him .	-7.3098
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.7279
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 rail project for Scotland .	-2.5899
HS2 Ltd 's work proposes achieving high-speed links between Scotland and the north of England at the beginning of Phase 1 in 2026 .	-3.6440
Secretary of State Baroness Kramer said that the ‘ will bring Britain closer together ’ project .	-2.6485
The Scottish Minister for Transport , Keith Brown , said that he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.9016
Phase 1 is a new high-speed rail link between London and the West Midlands .	-1.5943
After Phase 2 there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.3872
In June , the government adjusted GBP 42.6 billion to the estimated cost of building high-speed rail between London and North England .	-3.2059
The British Government , which is involved in discussions with Transport Scotland , has asked HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for North England and Scotland .	-4.3994
This includes the possibility of ultimately three hours or less travel from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-3.6244
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our objective for HS2 is a truly national network of routes that brings Britain and its cities closer together . ”	-2.9437
We are progressing with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.4920
Without it , we face a crisis of capacity on our rail network .	-2.6781
But there is also the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-3.6545
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael commented : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-4.4292
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael called for “ unequivocal ” commitment to Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-2.5982
Brown said : “ The high-speed rail link has the potential for huge economic benefits for Scotland , but Scotland ’ s economic power is also an argument for fast rail connections across Britain . ”	-5.2050
We are therefore pleased to work as a partner of the British Government and to examine the options for high-speed rail links in Scotland , which will bring benefits to everyone and complement the Glasgow Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-5.9306
I look forward to studying the study report with the British ministers next year and taking the next steps together .	-3.0755
Provisions on electronic equipment in aeroplanes are provisionally in force in Australia .	-3.1711
Australian air passengers must continue to shut down tablets and smartphones at startup and landing , despite efforts in the US to ease regulation of such devices .	-5.0727
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) allows US airlines to change their requirements so that passengers can read , watch , or play e-books on their devices during critical flight phases , provided they are in “ flight mode . ”	-4.8268
During most of the flight , passengers are already allowed to do so , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-4.7203
Australian societies are watching the decision to get the US airlines to do a lot of work , but have no immediate plans to amend their regulations .	-6.3173
The air traffic control authority CASA also said that the announcement will be viewed , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment in critical flight phases in Australia continue to apply .	-5.4364
“ CASA does not currently have any specific regulations regarding the use of electronic equipment on aircraft ” has been reported .	-5.0516
The issue is subject to provisions whereby airlines must maintain safety at all times and passengers must comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew .	-4.6092
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA about extending the use of his WiFi entertainment system on flights and says that it is open to change , but they should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.9797
“ We would welcome a review of CASA ’ s licensing of electronic devices , because we are convinced that this would improve the customer ’ s experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” a speaker said .	-5.1439
Qantas explained that it will remain in the current regulations until further notice .	-4.4650
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic devices must not be used at startup and landing , and we currently have no plans to change that , ” the company explained .	-4.8436
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.9224
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that passengers can benefit from , and we will certainly see the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-5.3882
The decision varies between US companies according to the age of the fleet .	-3.1866
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate wireless disruption through mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer documentation .	-4.3179
“ After an airline has confirmed the tolerance of its fleet , it can allow passengers to use portable electronic devices such as tablets , e-book reading devices and smartphones at all levels , ” the FAA announced .	-5.1530
In rare cases , the crew will charge the passengers while the landing turns off the equipment .	-6.4977
The group also recommended that heavier appliances be locked safely under the seat or in the overhead boxes at startup and landing .	-5.9931
Before the reverberby against Schalke , BVB enthusiasts with lighting provided for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-7.5297
Borussia Dortmund later announced hard consequences .	-2.9461
Before the Friday game of the football Bundesliga against the VfB Stuttgart , the Ulils responded with a silence - first of all . , , , , , , , , , , and . , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.3165
It was an unusual , almost divisive acoustics that offered the viewer a signal in Idona Park just before the whistle of the Bundesliga game between the German victor Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart .	-5.9495
Most of the guests were listening to their songs .	-5.5769
The south gallery , against which the most faithful of the faithful - and loudest - BVB fans stand , presented itself first exceptionally quiet : no strings , no battlecalls .	-6.7654
The podium of the Capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint fire , remained unused .	-4.4531
And at the very front of the gallery a big flag appeared with the headline " Stadionforschung " .	-6.5700
Only when Torhütter 's novel Weidenfeller , as always the first BVB player , was burnt down for a short time .	-6.7586
When his team colleagues followed , there were vocal and weeding scarves - but far from everywhere .	-4.7538
Nothing rained in the central blocs 12 and 13 of the south gallery .	-4.1518
Nor did Stadionpreacher Norbert Dickel once again record the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , victory over Arsenal , contract extension of the Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not cause a public release .	-6.8347
Just five minutes before the whistle , the Capo is opening its podium - and until then , the tension that could be reached by hand unfolded in a loud scream , as the hump as usual was cancelling the mood on the ranks in the stadium .	-12.3080
The last one was , as always , the South side gallery - and finally the loudest place in the stadium was once again .	-7.0194
And , at the latest , as the loud call from the South Stand " Derbysieger stands in " came , everything was .	-7.6030
The silence before me was probably a response to what has happened in recent days .	-3.3414
Immediately before Revierderby at the FC Schalke 04 , some of the top BVB supporters had fired firearms into the spectator and onto the place - and met almost Torhütter Roman Weidenfeller .	-8.2162
The game was delayed due to chaotic scenes .	-1.4128
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the laces of the Dortmunder Ults in his office - and believes Watzke 's words , this was a rather unfriendly deadline for the fan representatives .	-6.1858
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra-motion , " the BVB-Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.9580
As an immediate measure , Watzke subdued the Ultra with a choreography for the home game against the VfB Stuttgart .	-4.4577
" I banned this , " he explained .	-2.3233
We cannot abandon the zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.1604
In addition , various punishment options have been shown to the Ultras - until Tuesday they now have time to decide on one .	-7.5707
Otherwise , Watzke says , the BVB will set a penalty by the end of next week .	-3.3520
" This becomes drastic " , insured Watzke .	-3.9979
It is time to be curious to see what the reactions in the South gallery are then .	-5.7594
Deposit houses in Singapore , as the middle class crisis has hit .	-4.1864
In a deposit house in Bendemeer , Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga trades a golden bracelet , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay the school fees of her daughters .	-4.4092
“ My husband and I have just bought a house because my whole money is there , ” says Amirthalinga .	-3.4859
Although she earned 3.000 Singapore dollars ( about 1.730 euros ) per month as an administrative co-worker and also works her husband , the monthly family income is not sufficient , she explains .	-5.8339
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is growing – is so large that ValuMax , where she made her exchange , became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore Stock Exchange this week .	-5.4015
The food of jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 Singapore in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as unsecured bank loans .	-3.3718
Deposit houses in Singapore typically require an effective 17 % annual interest rate , just above the 15.4 % required by the United Overseas Bank , a local lender with a branch in the same mall .	-5.7506
However , deposit houses offer the advantage that there is no need to review credit rating or income proof , which is why loans are faster than at banks .	-5.7483
That is why millions of people in the region are turning to deposits , after families are feeling the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-5.0482
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and cheap credit on the basis of a loose fiscal policy in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income incomes are seeking deposits to balance the difference in stowage economies .	-6.8624
This week , the credit-rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing household debt , mainly through rising mortgages , was a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-4.4810
According to the Agency 's assessment , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore have the highest budgetary debt in Asia compared to gross domestic product .	-3.2659
Malaysia is at the top of the list , with 80 % of GDP rising in 2008 .	-2.9989
People ’ s economists are also concerned about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which this week has just come out of a technical recession .	-4.9788
On Thursday , the data showed a continuing weakening of exports and a drop in consumer demand .	-2.6184
“ In effect , given rising costs , people in the middle to the lower segment ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” said Song Seng Wu , an economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.8374
Historical highs at gold prices over the last two years have reinforced the trend to personalize personal items , as people use the opportunity to turn family jewellery into cash .	-7.0851

The company is financing the $ 66 million , which it received this week with the Singapore Stock Exchange .	-3.7820
While some lenders are in the crossfire because of high interest rates , Yeah explains that deposit houses are not only offering lower interest rates than other lenders , but also not directly increasing the debt .	-6.4168
“ Customers are insulting items they already possess , and the liquidation of personal valuables does not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.2646

Australian health rescue package of 325 million dollar	-1.9739
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions associated with the bailout package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for the tactical health service to ensure that the federal government cannot squander the money .	-4.4417
Federal health minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate action ” to avert a crisis caused by an aging population of the island state , a higher quota of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.3999
Funding for a period of four years was decided after government consultations with an independent Member of State Andrew Wilkie .	-4.0626
“ The government has created an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” Plisek said today .	-4.8191
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for election services .	-2.8901
A further 2600 operations , including orthopaedic interventions and treatments for gray star , are designed to eliminate residues .	-5.1153
In addition , there is money for daily clinics in hobby and Launceston , better follow-up to hospital stays , specialist exchanges , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-5.6055
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that I have been affected by by by by the hospital staff saying they are the best way to improve the tactical health system , ” Tanya Plibersek said .	-5.8837
The Minister insisted on the strict reporting and accountability of the tactical Government .	-3.4823
The federal state must maintain the current level of funding to receive money from the Commonwealth and report monthly on where the additional money was spent .	-4.3851
A three-headed Commission will be set up to ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-2.9342
As Wilkie said today , the $ 325 million would be of little use if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that would bring the public tasked health system to a more sustainable course . ”	-5.4017
Despite this , he praised the government for responding to its request for urgent aid , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister at the beginning of May .	-3.4121
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the custody list , ” Wilkie said .	-4.2597
According to the federal government , these electoral achievements will largely offset the recent cuts .	-3.3421
But the opposition ’ s health spokesman at the federal level , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ plastering . ”	-4.8883
“ We are in a position today because the lab government has deducted $ 430 million from the health care system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-4.6528
It is not acceptable that a state government should close to half a billion dollars out of the system , and that the Commonwealth should enter 300 million and then act as if that were good news .	-5.8498
Dutton asked Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar in the bailout package would be spent on additional red tape .	-3.5096

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such as a surveillance group	-3.3757
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and toxic gas ammunition facilities , declared Thursday the global chemical weapons monitoring group , while severe clashes occurred in the north of the country , near one of the sites suspected of being stored toxic substances .	-6.6193
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed nearly three years since the civil war began .	-2.8583
The announcement of the Organization for the Ban of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came one day before the deadline .	-3.5525
November 1 , which the organization of Damascus , based in The Hague , had set to destroy all chemical weapons manufacturing facilities or make “ unoperable ” , including all machines for mixing chemicals into poison gas and filling ammunition .	-5.5410
The conclusion of this process , which is essentially the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all Syria ’ s chemical weapons by mid-2014 .	-3.7535
The destruction of the facilities means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-2.1250
However , Damascus must begin to destroy existing weapons and stocks .	-2.5869
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including Senfgas and Sarin ’ s nerve gas .	-3.6183
The announcement came at a time when , on Thursday , there were battles in the city of Safira , experts say that there was a chemical weapon and storage facilities here , as indicated by the United Kingdom Syrian Human Rights Observatory .	-5.2798
The activist group , which has the number of dead over a network of activists in Syria , declared on Thursday that 120,296 people died .	-4.3887
Of these , 61,067 civilians , including 6,365 children , are among .	-2.1866
The government took part in 29,954 of them by the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 were government-friendly fighters and 187 Lebanese Hizbollah militias .	-4.8660
Also among the dead were 2.202 desperated soldiers and 5.375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-3.2296
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict to 100,000 since March 2011 .	-1.4541
This figure has not been updated .	-2.0491
The conflict has forced some two million people to flee the country .	-1.5061
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting the rebels in Safira for weeks , many of whom have links to al-Qaeda groups .	-3.3367
The observatory said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but did not mention details .	-3.5015
The battles highlight the danger facing chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the time in an escalating civil war .	-4.8904
According to OPCW , who works closely with the United Nations , “ the team is now convinced that it has seen and experienced its destruction all the major production and mixing facilities listed by Syria . ”	-4.9519
Therefore , ‘ no further inspection activities are planned at the moment ’ .	-3.2774
Earlier this week , the inspectors had declared that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 of 23 of the places given by Damascus .	-3.7073
Due to security concerns , the inspectors were not able to visit two institutions .	-3.6355
On Thursday , OPWC declared that , according to Syrian statements , the two sites were “ abandoned ... and the chemical weapons program objects there were transferred to other named facilities that were inspected . ”	-5.9118
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two facilities that the OPCW inspectors could not visit .	-3.3138
Syria has presented a plan for the complete destruction of its chemical weapons , which must be approved by the OPWC Executive Committee next month .	-2.7460
“ I salute the bravery and the courage you have all shown in completing the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organisation , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the CEO of the surveillance organization in a comment published by OPCW .	-5.5557
For three years now , the mainly Sunni Muslim rebels in this civil war have been fighting against Assad ’ s government and their security forces , which include many members of the Alawite , a secession of Shia Islam .	-4.0851
As far as further developments are concerned , the chairman of the observation group , Rami Abradurraman , said that on Wednesday there was a major explosion in an air defence facility in the Syrian coastal province of Latakia .	-6.1086

Fury on Morning for Bali Bombers	-3.5799
Revisited and relatives of the 202 people who died in 2002 when the Bali bomb struck , they responded with anger at the verdict for the last of the instigator who was put to trial , because Umar Patek believed that Umar should be shot by law .	-9.2182
Patek , who was under ten years of flight as one of the most sought-after persons in Southeast Asia , was sentenced yesterday to a sentence of 20 years in prison for his role in building explosives for the bombing .	-5.1646
He could be released after 15 years in prison .	-2.5819

The Public Prosecutor had asked for life imprisonment , even if she could have applied for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bomber , was also called “ Demoliton Man ” .	-6.3919
The decision has provoked painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth , who has lost her 39-year-old twins Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his fellow authors nearly ten years ago .	-5.7953
She fought with tears and said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.6154
I really think it should follow in the footsteps of the other guys .	-1.9294
" One should put him in front of the shooting command , " Corteen said against AAP .	-5.5532
I have to live with the fact that I will not get any more grandchildren every day and I will never see my daughters .	-4.6255

He fell into coma for a month after the attack , and “ died ” three times , while depending on a life-support system .	-5.2563
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemaah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samurra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-3.7663
Indeed , this type should be given the death penalty before all the others .	-3.7454
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-3.3538
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much .	-3.2795
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber to be tried .	-3.4318
He was almost a decade of capture , but eventually came up in January 2011 in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad , where US forces killed former al-Qaeda chief Osama bin Laden just under four months later .	-5.3456
During the negotiation , a FBI agent said that intelligence reports had indicated that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of reconstructing the connection between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.9428
“ He did not stand up , ” said Corteen .	-2.5648
Until recently , he has shown no remorse of how much pain he has inflicted on other people .	-3.2908
The verdict passed before the 10th anniversary of the attack this year , which will be commemorated in Bali and Australia .	-3.9413
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.3257
Patek may appeal against his verdict .	-1.9867
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic equipment on aircraft ( but not on mobile phone calls )	-3.4035
Air travelers can now use their electronic devices to read , work , play , music , and watch movies from departure to landing , but not by mobile phones , such as the new guidelines issued by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the US on Thursday .	-6.5408
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.6837
How fast they would be implemented by the airline concerned , FAA staff Michael Huerta said at a press conference .	-4.3362
The airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of the airline personnel and the rules on the storage of the aircraft in accordance with the new regulations .	-6.2551
The FAA explained that they have already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment on aircraft .	-4.4244
These airlines included Delta and JetBlue .	-2.6998
“ Depending on the plan ’ s state , we could very soon approve the extended use of electronic equipment , ” the FAA announced .	-3.9813
At present , passengers must turn off smart phones , tablets , and other devices when aircraft doors are closed .	-3.3619
You may not restart them until the aircraft reaches a maximum of three kilometres and gives the captain the green light .	-5.0195
When entering the landing flight , passengers must switch off them again and must not restart them before the aircraft has landed .	-4.8146
According to the new directives , airlines whose aircraft are secured for electronic interference could allow their passengers to use the equipment even at launch , landing and on the pitch , the FAA explained .	-5.9751
Most new commercial aircraft and other aircraft converted to higher heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-3.6923
Laura Gladiding , President of the Professional Association of professional cabin crew , welcomed the changes .	-3.8556
“ If the new regulation is implemented securely – and we work closely with the airline in this regard – both sides will benefit from it , ” Gladiding commented .	-4.4662
We are honestly sorry to have to feel like passers-by on this issue .	-3.9175
Nevertheless , Internet connections for browsing , e-mails exchange , text messages or downloading data below three kilometres remained prohibited , the authority explained .	-5.0428
Passengers are asked to move smartphones , tablets , and other devices in flight mode .	-3.2812
So there is still no “ Words With Friends ” , the Scrabble similar online game played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave an American Airlines jet for the public , because he refused to turn off the device while the plane was on the gate .	-7.2045
And heavier equipment , such as laptops , must be kept in storage , as there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-5.1489
Mobile phone conversations during the flight will also remain prohibited .	-3.1011
The regulatory authority for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-2.5972
FAA may ban certain electronic devices on startup and landing .	-3.3247
Last month , Mark Rosenker said of the National Transportation Safety Board , a safety expert on national traffic issues on CBS News , mobile phones would still be regarded as a risk .	-6.5793
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially interfere with navigation equipment , but because we know from the FCC that transmitting from the air can also disrupt broadcasting masts , ” says Rosenker .	-5.0029
Last month , an industry advisory committee , launched by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended that the government allow more deployment of personal electronic devices .	-4.3114
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to ease restrictions on use .	-3.2953
Critics such as the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri take the view that there are no valid safety grounds for the ban .	-3.7187
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce because the use of the equipment has become ubiquitous .	-3.3473
In some studies , we are talking about the fact that up to a third of passengers are forgetting or ignoring the closure of the device .	-6.1672
The FAA began in 1966 to restrict the use of electronic devices by air travellers after reports of disruptions to navigation and communication equipment by UK-led radios , which were then the latest technology trend .	-5.9937
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also designed and approved by the FAA to ensure that electronic interference does not mean anything to them .	-4.5834
For some years now , airlines have offered passengers Wi-Fi when the flight is reached .	-5.1337
The planes fitted with Wi-Fi-systems are also less sensitive to interference .	-3.2948
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , said Huerta .	-3.5955
Today ’ s electronic devices generally emit much less radio radiation than previous generations .	-2.9586
E-readers , for example , only provide minimal radiation when roaming .	-4.0975
But transference values are stronger when downloading or sending data .	-2.9018
One of the advocates of loosening restrictions on passenger use is Amazon.com.	-3.0545
In 2011 , the company staff invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle E-Reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not find them .	-5.3203
Members of the FAA advisory committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-2.4989
Douglas Kidd of the National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believes that the disruption of the equipment is genuine , even if the risk is minimal . are . are , , , , and . are . ,	-8.1646
Other members of the committee said that there are only isolated reports of pilots who would be happy to interfere with aircraft systems through the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-5.4925
However , the FAA committee recommended allowing pilots to arrange for the take-off of the equipment by passengers in the event of poor visibility .	-6.2281
A group from the travel industry welcomed the changes and called them a sensible adjustment for travellers who today would be well equipped with technology .	-4.9448
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a comfortable passenger experience is not in conflict with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-2.9866
Recreated bird controlled by air rescue service from the North Sea oatmeal .	-5.6977
An aerial rescue service to the coastal bird , which had been exhausted on an North Sea oath , was restored to nature .	-6.2063
The Watershed was flown to Aberdeen last month with a helicopter , tearing it into its rescue centre in Alloa by the Scottish animal welfare organization SPCA .	-6.3220
Colin Seddon , head of the center , said : “ This waterways was probably a wintry train from northern Europe , which was stopped by strong winds across the North Sea . ”	-5.5117
Apparently , the exhausted bird sought refuge on the drilling island .	-2.8448
He added : “ He could no longer fly , which is why we were contacted with the request for help . ”	-3.6049
When she was released , the course was back fit and healthy .	-4.0135
Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Britain ?	-1.2886
Business for Britain started in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those in Britain want to change in our relations with the EU .	-3.2297
To this end , we have commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy , and the EU .	-6.2158
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business executives , representing roughly the UK ’ s corporate sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.6572
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.3127
We have found that the vast majority of companies are now exported outside Europe and concentrated on countries that modernise and grow while the EU states are stagnating .	-4.2525
They want government leaders to favor new trade ties with countries like China , India , and Brazil , rather than stem from the long and arduous process of reforming obscure EU institutions .	-4.2543
In their view , on certain legal issues – from cartel law to product legislation – the majority of economic leaders believe that control of these key competences should be brought back to Westminster .	-5.6399
There was widespread discontent about the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of the Brussels rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade zone – even 40 % of large companies voted that have traditionally been most pro-European .	-5.6243
Finally , and probably most of all , our survey of economic leaders revealed that a clear majority of the United Kingdom would like to see a course towards changing the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade , a policy .	-6.3268
This insight , which finds itself among companies of all sizes and leaders , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that brings the lift of action back to Britain .	-5.6113
There is a lot at stake – a change in the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a 16 % change of opinion in favor of EU remaining in a referendum .	-5.0897
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate the British conditions for EU membership .	-3.0738
It also shows that companies expect a significant shift in power relations back to Britain from renegotiation .	-3.1739
A better deal for the British economy is possible and increasingly necessary now that the eurozone is moving towards closer economic and fiscal union .	-2.6233
The priority must be jobs and growth in Britain , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels regulatory approach .	-3.8942
Alexei Miller of Gazprom describes pipeline in Bulgaria as the beginning of a new gas era .	-4.8883
The construction of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria is the start of one of the largest European energy projects , declared by the Gazprom Board of Directors .	-3.1593
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : the construction work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said GazProm CEO Alexei Miller , on Thursday in a statement .	-3.9480
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-1.6546
South Stream is intended to increase diversity on Russia ’ s export routes through Europe .	-3.0052
A dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where most of Russia ’ s gas is stored for Europe , is concerned with increased risk on conventional routes , as the official evidence suggests .	-5.8609
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ eliminated forever . ”	-2.7478
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at discounted rates when the whole project comes into operation in 2015 .	-3.2272
According to Gazprom , construction work in other downstream countries will begin on the planned route at the end of the year .	-3.0002
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-2.6058

Hearing the Royal Commission : Two YMCA employees accused of having sex crimes against Jonathan Lord .	-3.8514
Two YMCA staff from New South Wales ( NSW ) were charged with sex crimes related to children before 2011 accusations were made against the child carer Jonathan Lord of Caringbah , as the Royal Commission learned of child sex abuse .	-5.8269
However , during the opening statement to the Commission , the YMCA stated that “ the organization never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse ” .	-5.2411
Managing Director Phillip Hare was interviewed about a case in which a YMCA employee was accused of offences against child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 was sentenced for abuse of children entrusted to him .	-6.1912
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission ’ s aiding lawyer , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-2.6250
He admitted that the opening statement of the YMCA to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that ‘ there have been external reviews of the YMCA , in which the YMCA has been recognised as at the forefront of child safety ’ .	-4.8728
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA has been informed that it has received the second lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of the year .	-3.9151
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the management failed “ from me to downwards ” in placing Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report violations of the child safety guidelines .	-5.9356
Lord was convicted at the beginning of the year for sex offences against twelve boys during his two years of work for the YMCA .	-4.0515
He has been sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.3360
Hare , however , disputes that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s violations of children ’ s safety .	-4.7076
The staff said they had observed violations , including that Lord was alone with children , she was privately cared for as a baby sitter , she was sitting on his lap , one said he loved it , and that children were playing with his mobile phone .	-7.1331
Danielle Ockwell , whose superior Lord was , and who asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his behavior , said that the child care director Jacqui Barnat , who was the superior laurels in the YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and most of the time was very useless . ”	-7.9405
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have dared to reimburse their superiors .	-5.0012
Instead , he said , it was her friendship with Lord her judgment that she had not reported him .	-6.2737
Hare explained that he has told the Board of Directors of YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization has to learn from the “ Jonathan-Lord incident ” has been “ not to report ” by staff , and the Board of Directors has agreed to it .	-7.0116
Hare said that the decision to urge staff to sign confidentiality obligations soon after the allegations occurred was taken by the managing director of the YMCA children 's services , Liam Whiteley .	-4.8325
He said that this should prevent contamination of the evidence , but that was “ overzealous ” and poorly implemented .	-4.1162
The YMCA NSW was at a time when Jonathan Lord was working there between 2009 and 2011 , did not have a safe organization for children , Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , an expert on sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-8.8150
He explained that there were “ serious problems ” in recruitment , review , containment , training , and supervision of employees .	-3.9540
The hearing was postponed until 20 December .	-0.7777
Tony Blair said he would take the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister , but admits that a comeback is unlikely .	-2.5065
In an interview tonight on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his leaving office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.1357
Since his resignation in June 2007 , after a decade as head of state , Blair has largely avoided expressing his views on British politics , and has mostly limited his comments to foreign policy and his role as the envoy of the Quartet of the Middle East Peace Foun.	-6.0610
On the question of whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair ’ s quote from the London Evening Standard was “ Yes , safe , but it is unlikely that it will happen , so ... ”	-5.5977
When the horse shooters arrived in droves in Cardiff to arbitrate the horse of the year , they knew that a tough competition was in the pipeline .	-7.0074
But no one was prepared for the three years Fenton Kirklands .	-3.7343
The knee , which is not even in the kindergarten and has taken his first steps only a few months ago , and his Shetland Pony Toffee stroked through the three rounds and won the first price – leaving 30 adult opponents behind .	-6.1012
The disconnected couple , both equally large , were praised for their appearance , behavior and style in annual competition organised by the Sunnybank Equivalian Centre in RuDry near Cardiff .	-5.7959
On his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had raised his plate gear in a freak angle and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-7.0938
Fenton was praised by the Jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the Pony , which was far beyond his age .	-4.1719
And Toffee received top marks for his appearance and personality .	-3.2885
Fenton had been given Toffee as a gift for his third birthday last March , and since then she has been wearing the Shetland Pony every day .	-5.8542
His mother , Donna , 30 , said : “ Fenton and Toffee are a great ghost . ”	-2.2874
They had to compete against the entire pitch and went off with Goldpoal and Rosette .	-4.4026
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-3.2430
Full-coming strangers in the arena found him so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with him .	-4.5917
The small boy from the village of Nantyglo , near Ebbw Vale , South Wales , follows the footsteps of his Tante Sharon Howles , who has been leading horses for over ten years .	-5.6820
Howles said : “ The entire audience was like electrized , and all of them fired and shouted . ”	-6.3103
He ran over the entire length of the arena , and although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-4.8267
Fenton is crazy towards animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens he takes care of .	-3.1472
As it starts , it will not take long for him to be on the “ horse of the year ” mess – and I am sure he will do well .	-4.0895
A spokesman for the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-3.9797
Together they are a great team .	-1.6298
The jury rated Fenton and Toffee on how well they had beaten and presented themselves in the demonstration ring .	-4.1730
They care for good cooperation between Pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best on the ring .	-4.1153
I am sure that Fentons ’ s sweet clothing has played its part in making it a perfect occasion .	-5.3133
China ’ s newspaper is supposed to be “ reformed . ”	-3.6695
A Chinese newspaper calling for the release of a reporter on the front page accused of defamation said a press regulator .	-3.9263
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had issued a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.5158
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a partial government firm .	-3.3717
Now the New Express is being subjected to a “ comprehensive reconstitution , ” the regulatory authority declared .	-4.8695
The “ rectification ” was provided by the Press and Publications Authority , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-4.3152
The preliminary investigation revealed that , between September 2012 and August 2013 , the New Express , which belongs to the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several inaccurate reports on the publicly traded company Zollion .	-4.8766
“ The New Express ’ s editorial management was disordered , ” the regulatory authority issued a statement .	-3.2581
She said it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty on Chen Yongzhou and remove his reporting license . ”	-3.9581
In addition , “ Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to perform a full rearrangement of the New Express , and recommended that the relevant leaders at the New Express be identified and immediately reviewed the New Express leadership team . ”	-7.0845
Chen had written several articles for the New Express reporting of alleged financial irregularities in a construction machine manufacturer called Zollion .	-4.1499
After being arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and stood behind his journalistic work .	-2.4957
But then Chen joined state television and admitted that he had issued false reports for payment .	-3.2823
“ In this case , I hurt Zollion , as well as the entire news industry and its ability to win public confidence , ” he explained to CCTV , the state news channel .	-6.3647
I did so primarily because I was on money and glory .	-3.4589
It has become clear to me that I have been wrong .	-3.2552
Following Chen ’ s apology , the New Express published an apology on the front page , saying that it failed to check the reports correctly .	-3.2256
Several well-known suspects have recently appeared on television confessions .	-3.0460
Experts say that confessions are still routinely enforced , despite a legislative change at the beginning of the year , in which the authorities have been banned from forcing someone to accuse themselves .	-4.9708
discovered Drug tunnel with its own rail link between the US and Mexico	-3.4014
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the US and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electrical rail , has now been discovered .	-4.5291
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimeters measuring tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they ever found .	-3.5010
The tunnel , which runs across a length of almost six football fields in the zickzacken pattern , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-4.6562
There are countless unimaginable warehouses in the area , making it easier to hide lorries loaded with drugs .	-4.4801
The authorities declared that the tunnel had been closed before drugs could be transported unknowingly .	-5.3119
In the discovery of the tunnel , eight and a half tonnes of marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were secured , according to the records of the court .	-3.8737
Three men who , according to the authorities , worked as a driver were charged for the ownership and intended sale of Marihuana and cocaine .	-4.7026
They are threatened with prison sentences of ten years and lifetime when they are sentenced to death .	-5.2802
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers set on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels .	-2.2988
The tunnel is the eighth large passage that has been discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-2.1613
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in October after the Marihuana Harvest in Central Mexico , which challenges drug cartels as they can quickly bring their product to consumers .	-5.0678
In 2010 , authorities found a passage of some 640 metres long with rails , which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two storehouses in San Diego .	-5.4520
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love each other .	-1.8046
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.4499
In an interview , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love himself .	-2.3008
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are the parents of the 2-year Flynn .	-3.2069
Actor Orlando Bloom has commented on the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.5918
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who should be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life is sometimes not exactly as we plan or hope . "	-3.8406
Kerr and he still loved himself , underlined the 36-year-old .	-3.0580
" We will support each other and love Flynn 's parents .	-2.7178
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , and in 2011 their sons Flynn was born .	-1.7938
Veganism , according to lexica , is subservient to vegetarianism , is quite different from this one .	-6.6221
Because , while vegetarians are allowed to consume cream , ice or a strong Edam , these dummies are not on a vegan menu .	-5.5749
Milk , cheese , egg , besides renouncing meat and fish , the vegan leaves from all consumption of animal products - honey is denied as well .	-6.2329
What remains , one might ask , but on closer examination , the vegan nutrition world is characterized by considerable ingenuity .	-5.8629
" BroAction Tries are very popular , " explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , which provides a variety of special products for vegans .	-5.2618
Reuben Proctor is also happy to visit the shop at Domgasse .	-2.6202
The native New Zealand vegan has lived for 13 years , and in Lammerheim he finds ( almost ) everything he needs to live . " in , , , , , , , , , and . , , , , ,	-7.1438
At the turn of the century the next step was taken and I became a vegan .	-2.4753
" Convincing came not only because of nutrition but because of the choice of shoes " , says Proctor , who prefers the leather leather leather leather leather of the ordinary .	-8.0465
He recognized that it is possible in other everyday situations without animal products .	-4.3467
In the first place , vegan is one of ethics .	-4.2295
" I do not want animals to die for me " , Proctor explains the maxim of the vegans , which covers all consumer behaviour .	-4.4407
Instead of rushing burgers , beekeepers , or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products , the excitement increased .	-7.7471
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " in fact vegan does not constitute a waiver , not an Askese , but an enrichment " .	-5.5751
And it was precisely these conditionality that led to some even more well-intentioned attempts to fail .	-5.9002
" The search factor is a crucial factor that enables many people to give up quickly , similar to smoking , " Proctor makes a comparison .	-5.7650
And put it : " Certain tastes are not tied to the pet " .	-5.2766
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.8470
" You can create the same effect in other ways " , the vegan makes clear .	-5.1759
For a barbecue , Proctor will bring eggplants , mushrooms and also a few vegan sausages .	-6.0811
It focuses on a balanced , varied diet , where it should be tasty at once . .	-8.1338
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-3.3372
" It should taste , but this is not just to reduce to animal food , " said Proctor .	-3.4075
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , he did not suffer .	-3.5673
For me , the changeover had a positive aspect .	-2.6407
I do not accept any foreign cholesterol and I have an increased proportion of vitamins .	-4.1781
There are high performance athletes who only feed to vegan .	-4.1312
" My blood values are best , I often check out , " explains Proctor .	-4.1127
In particular , many vegans warn against the lack of vitamin B12 .	-3.1686
" Since animals are fed with feed rather than grazing on the pasture , it is doubtful whether the meat you buy in the cooling true is the vitamin B12 percentage high , " Proctor .	-5.6850
Vegans also have the possibility of taking the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.3973
" My B12 values are fine , " he explains .	-2.3439
There is no need for Proctor to go down the road to food procurement .	-4.1980
After all , staple foods are everywhere , and every supermarket now has soy milk and other products .	-4.2668
I find everything I need on the ground .	-4.5421
Only from time to time can I buy something special .	-3.0496
" Many people overlook the fact that only finished products are expensive , but this is how things are known for " ordinary " finished products " .	-4.5293
At any rate , the preparation of vegan dishes would have been much cheaper and less time-consuming than was commonly assumed .	-4.5038
" In the house kitchen there is a lot to discover , with a few small hubs you can achieve good , if not partly better results , " says Proctor .	-5.0064
Margarine instead of butter , a little more powdered and carbon dioxide instead of egg , with its vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring his cheese-makers to amaze .	-6.4938
Family celebrations give the vegan a new flavor .	-4.9778
If we cook together , this has a new significance .	-5.4705
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.4595
He was also , of course , sceptical .	-3.1710
Will my meal no longer suit you ?	-3.9170
" Should I feel bad now , because I drink milk ? " - as a vegan , you have to act with sensitivity in such matters .	-6.4220
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society , " does not want Proctor to be an enclosure time .	-4.6575
And , more precisely , everyday life does not seem as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not suffer as much in everyday life as is commonly thought .	-8.3145
Even Fast Food is allowed .	-1.5896
Pommes are everywhere !	-3.1537
" Many Döners offer blackboard , or even a vegetarian yfka , " says Proctor .	-4.5461
In a pizzeria it differs on pasta dishes , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a matter of habit .	-4.8376
The restaurants are so slow to cater for this .	-4.4114
" When I started to feed vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult " , the New Zealander can find a development : " You have to talk to people , draw them to attention " .	-6.3818
" If there are enough questions , they may be inclined to supplement the menu , " he hopes .	-3.3866
Vegan restaurants are developing , such as the comedy bar in Mannheim or the Café Vogelfrei .	-4.3202
Proctor wants other restaurants to have at least one vegan meal on the menu .	-3.5418
In fact , there are a lot of vegan dishes for everyone .	-5.9296
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.4895
On the other hand , " meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others " , Proctor says .	-4.2355
" If we want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way to make the most of the start impossible , " says Proctor .	-3.6907
The purchasing of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-4.5738
In particular , when you learn to understand that animal additives can also be contained in earthy agents as colourers , you seem to be quickly forgiven the courage to observe ethics in so many hurdles and traps .	-9.0938
Not only have Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen written a book : " Veganissimo - Animal Ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are added to food and also cleaning agents .	-4.3510
" By and by definition , you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to respect " It is sometimes better to do small steps than just stand or stumble " , says Proctor .	-6.0848
Veganism is an important moral finger pointing to awareness .	-4.1110
Perhaps he does not quite manage to lay down his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to critically scrutinise their habits .	-5.1587
The Exchange Operator Nasdaq OMX keeps its customers in breath .	-3.3877
Trading at Nasdaq Options Market was suspended on Friday afternoon in German .	-4.0778
In a communication the operator was responsible for technical problems .	-1.6481
The other 11 US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-1.9401
The most recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger failures with the stock exchange operator .	-5.4271
Only on Tuesday , the Nasdaq indices were not calculated for an hour due to data transfer errors .	-3.2693
In August of this year there were two mishaps alone in one week .	-4.0341
First of all , the US investment bank Goldman Sachs sent massive erroneous purchasing orders to the option markets due to technical problems .	-4.8701
As a result , stock market operators needed almost a whole day to look through and delete the orders .	-4.6964
Two days later , half of all equity trading in the US caused a computer pan at the Nasdaq Exchange for several hours .	-4.7454
Also last year , the listing of Facebook was on display .	-4.4145
The Nasdaq systems were not up to the flood of orders for sale and purchase , later detected the SEC stock market supervisor and donated the company to a record $ 10 million fine .	-6.3327
Konstanz : Radler drives 63-year-olds	-1.9878
On the accident , according to data from the police , when a 26 year old man on Thursday evening , at 22 o 'clock , was on the opposite side of the road on the left sidewalk from the station to the market place .	-8.4271
When a 63 years old man came out of a restaurant on the sidewalk , the bicycle driver could no longer , according to the police , slow down in time .	-7.6398
In the following collision , the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall , later down to the ground and moved on to the head for about 15 centimeters of space .	-8.6918
A rescue car team brought the injured to the clinic for medical treatment .	-2.7645
British police forces are making Assange a certificate of extradition	-4.1141
The British police have today handed an extradition notification to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and sought asylum at the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-3.7677
Scotland Yard said that 40-year-old Australians were “ invited to stand up , ” prompting him to appear in a police station , and added that if he did not comply , he would be imprisoned .	-6.5120
Assange is threatening to extradite to Sweden for the charge of a sex offence after having exhausted its possibilities under British law since the Supreme Court rejected his opposition to extradition earlier this month .	-5.4231
Because he fears that Stockholm would leave him to the US , on 19 June he sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.8678
Scotland Yard said that “ a 40-year man was invited to stand at a police station that we selected , ” said a speaker .	-6.9923
He continues to violate the conditions of his release on bail .	-1.5963
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police call .	-3.6761
Assange fears that he will be delivered from Sweden to the United States , and that he will be indicted for possible spy accusations after having published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on the drainage website WikiLeaks .	-5.9205
Drivers with 210 km / h and hot drink between legs receive 1,000 <unk> penalty .	-4.6595
A driver was charged a penalty of 1,000 <unk> because he drove with up to 210 km / h and a hot drink between his legs .	-4.3285
Andrew Howie , 35 , from Tiptree , Essex , was stopped on May 27 with his Mercedes Benz at the A120 at Braintree .	-3.0230
After the police stopped him , they discovered the beverage cup between his legs .	-3.6073
In front of the Colchester District Court , Howie found himself guilty without the necessary care and attention .	-6.6272
He received seven points and a six-month ban on driving .	-2.1348
Howie was also condemned to pay 90 <unk> and a victim surcharge of 100 <unk> .	-2.8833
Taxation for Foreign Property Owners Against London ’ s Bubbles	-4.4985
The Ministry of Finance has provisionally calculated the CGT-measure , but is still waiting for the final decision of Chancellor of the Exchequer George Osborne , who had imposed a 7 % tax on homes that cost more than GBP 2 million and annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a company and not as individuals in 2012 .	-7.1364
Already , revenues from the Stampel of Residential Property in the districts of Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea , which were at GBP 708 million in 2012 / 13 tax year , are bringing together the proceeds for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , the North-East , Northwest , Yorkshire and the Humber region .	-6.9030
Cook said : “ After the increases in the stamp tax on high-price housing and the introduction of the related legislation against relocation , it is difficult to claim that high quality property is too low tax , regardless of the impact of the obsolete community tax system . ”	-7.1583
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more reticent about buying properties in London , or discourage owners from selling , ” he added .	-3.8142
First-class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at a price – in the affluent South West London belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , has paid off the record of 11.8 % last year .	-5.5011
The prices in Central London had a steady annual growth rate of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” in which the southwestern part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as a savills investigation .	-9.8715
Scientists have been able to shed more light on the context in which a dog 's tail spit is associated with his mood .	-6.1412
Previous research had shown that happy dogs carried the tail to the right more ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while in nervous dogs it was the left side .	-5.2361
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive these subtle differences and react to them . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.7238
Professor Georgio Vallornemiga , a neuroscientist from the University of Trento , said : “ People know well that the left and right half of the brain react differently to stimuli that generate positive or negative feelings . ”	-8.1131
We tried to do this with other species .	-3.1593
He also noticed that in dogs , just as in humans , the right brain half was responsible for the movement of the left and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-4.6706
In order to learn more about how dogs react to the lateral sweating of their artists , researchers monitored animals while these films were directed by other dogs .	-7.2128
They measure the heart rate of the four legs and analyzed the behavior .	-2.8470
We will probably soon understand why the tail is heading in one direction or the other .	-5.9861
Professor Vallornemiga said : “ We showed dogs movies with dogs – either a true natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we were able to control the movement of the tail more left or right . ”	-6.9329
If the animals saw the way a otherwise useless dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the sleeping dog ) , they remained completely relaxed .	-5.2969
But if the tail tends mainly to the left ( again from the perspective of the dog that blows ) , their heart rate rose and they looked calm .	-6.5857
According to Professor Vallortchaga , dogs do not deliberately communicate with each other through these movements .	-3.7676
He is convinced that the dogs had learned from experience in which movements they should be concerned and when not .	-4.1029
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs , and the swing is linked to a more friendly attitude and the right side produces a less friendly behaviour , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-7.1417
Researchers say that the findings could help dog owners , veterinarians , and trainers better understand the emotions of their animals .	-3.4090
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behaviour and guest stipendiat at the Faculty of Animal Relief at the University of Bristol , explained that this was not the first study to study whether left and right is important for dogs .	-5.4441
Last year , a team from the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and right when it is a satisfied dog .	-4.7612
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , there was the following : “ Dogs tend to go to a robotic dog when his tail blows on the left and not right , rather than being restless – just the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-7.5667
According to his statement , the differences could therefore boast that the dogs in the various studies did not interpret the animals in the films or the robotic dogs as dogs .	-4.8315
A study of how dogs react to real dogs could help , he explained .	-2.0781
“ Although there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brains are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-3.8950
But as their behavior simply lets them record , it will probably not take long to understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other .	-7.3486
Arcic Monkeys ’ appearance in Glasgow due to illness Alex Turns	-3.8168
The Rockband Arcic Monkeys has moved a performance in Glasgow after their lead singer has become ill with throat infections .	-7.1163
The band from Sheffield should play in the Hydro on Friday .	-3.1299
Due to the illness of the lead singer Alex Turner , the concert now has to be moved .	-3.8668
The announcement of the band came after she had to move an appearance at the LG Arena in Birmingham on Thursday .	-3.6819
In a statement on their official website , the Arctic Monkeys said : “ After the decision to cancel the show at the LG Arena in Birmingham this evening , and on medical advice , the Arctic Monkeys also have to cancel the show in Hydro in Glasgow on Friday , November 1 . ”	-6.3757
“ In Alex Turner , a throat head replacement was diagnosed , so he cannot appear . ”	-4.9242
The show at the LG Arena in Birmingham will take place on November 20 , which was moved to November 21 in the Hydro in Glasgow .	-3.4830

Pope Francis appoints the First Cardinal Chancellors in February	-2.0899
Pope Francis will appoint the Catholic Church ’ s new cardinal generals on February 22 , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-3.6143
Cardinal Chancellors are the highest clerics in the Catholic Church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-4.7328
There are currently 201 cardinal generals .	-1.8695
However , a cardinal who has reached an age of 80 can no longer vote in the Pope – a group of 120 “ elected cardinals . ”	-5.3538
In a statement in which the news was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a spokesman for the Vatican , said that there will be a meeting of all the cardinal leaders before the ceremony for the appointment of the new Cardinal Chancellors , also known as the Congregation .	-6.3963
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce his decision to convene the Conistium in February in advance , so that other meetings that require the participation of Cardinal rule from around the world can be planned , ” Lombardi .	-8.0935
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that by February the number of eligible cardinal generals would probably have fallen .	-3.6033
He said that a Pope normally appoints as many cardinal generals as needed to return to 120 , and as many cardinal generals over 80 as he wants .	-6.1532
The ruling board is important next year because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , says Valero .	-4.5884
There is now some overlap on the part of Europe and , in particular , Italy .	-3.5843
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint Cardinal generals from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-2.5334
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-3.0891
The cardinal generals will also be the first to be appointed since the formation of the Cardinal Chancellery founded by Francis , a group of eight cardinal officials from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church .	-5.3702
In the past , the Pope chose everything alone .	-2.3035
“ Now Francis has chosen these eight cardinal channels to help him , ” said Valero .	-3.0220
He explained that it is “ perfectly possible ” for Francis to ask the cardinal generals for advice .	-4.2571
But we have not been in this position so far – that is all new .	-3.6485
Valero said that typically the bishops from large places would be called cardinal , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we don ’ t know who he appoints . ”	-5.4345
GM is calling for new Pickup Trucks in the USA to repair the seat backrest .	-4.2913
General Motors is calling for almost 19.000 of its brand new Chevrolet Silverado- and GMC Sierra-Pickup Trucks built in 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat backrest , a Friday communication from the US regulatory authority for vehicle safety .	-8.6065
Some of the cars may have a defect in the mechanism for putting back the front seat backrest .	-3.6513
For this reason they do not comply with the Federal Directives on vehicle safety with headrests .	-3.7554
“ When driving from behind on the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not protect the occupants correctly , so that there is an increased risk of injury , ” was read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-5.9791
The used models were manufactured between 1 August and 10 September .	-2.6523
The delivery of GM Trucks started in June and represents the most important model start of the leading US car manufacturer since the insolvenz-based restructuring in 2009 .	-7.9925
GM informed vehicle owners in the first half of October about the defect .	-2.0434
Because of the 16-day government shutdown , NHTSA could not check the notification letter , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-4.9576
The sale of the Silvermoon and Sierra Trucks , which were newly developed for the 2014 model year , increased by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , declared GM on Friday .	-4.7280
In October sold GM 42.660 Silver and 16.503 Sierra Pickup Trucks .	-3.2477
GM shares on the New York Stock Exchange increased by 1.4 percent to $ 37.47 on the Friday afternoon .	-2.9845
The Desperate of an Obama Vote	-2.2670
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change will be possible .	-2.4487
He says Obama has made laudable efforts thwarted by the Republicans ’ blocking tactics .	-3.2379
The Block Policy does not apologize for Obamacare ’ s Web site problems , drone attacks .	-3.6903
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 election campaign are a sad reminder of what might have been possible .	-2.4236
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-1.2202
I am reading a terribly sad book .	-3.1753
It is a book of which I believed that it would give me , and hope , during the blazing second year of my medical university .	-6.6256
It is called “ The Audacity to Win , ” and describes the memoirs of Barack Obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .	-3.8050
When I finish with my patient records in the evening and go to bed , the book takes me back to a time when politics inspired millions of people and was able to smoke the breath .	-6.7775
The election was a landslide victory and news speaker to demonstrate the historic importance of this hour .	-3.8521
My classmates complained of joy and my parents collected all the newspapers they could find .	-3.0825
A young team of visionaries was on the way to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.1685
When Obama changed into office in 2008 , he had 82 % support .	-2.6374
And then I close the book .	-1.5874
Turning to the present is a bad awakening , as if you are being torn out of a dream .	-3.5231
It is difficult to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.4828
In the years since I first voted , something has actually changed .	-4.8708
But it is simply nothing I could have imagined .	-2.5943
I acknowledge the great and varied things Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of the forced conspiracy from homosexuality in the army and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-3.7299
I , too , believe that the bipartisan tactics have gone too far to bring our nation forward : immigration reform , public health insurance option , and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-7.3727
But , having defended the Obama administration countless times against colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my attempts to explain .	-4.3392
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.1589
The republican policy of obstruction cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to leave or the killing of innocent children by drones in overseas .	-5.0990
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on the private lives of Americans , and why whistleblower is penalized to expose government malfeasance .	-5.0331
It cannot be explained why Anwar al-Awlaki , an American citizen , was murdered without trial , nor why public funding and spending limits were circumvented during the presidential elections .	-6.2682
It does not justify the results of a report that says that the White House ’ s efforts to keep the media calm are the “ most aggressive ... since the Nixon government . ”	-3.0098
More recently , it cannot excuse the inability to design a simple Web site in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.6881
I do not know whether that is what I should have expected .	-1.6500
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict the political campaign that preceded it .	-3.9521
Obviously , the Office of Deputies is not a predictable course because a opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-4.7781
But looking at the above examples , they seem to be largely elected by the government itself .	-3.1129
And that bothers me most .	-1.3154
I re-elected Obama in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.3863
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative , but he seemed unable to define his direction and positions .	-4.4717
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from the pressure of future elections , would fulfil the hope we had heard for so long .	-3.0984
But , with the positive vote for Obama at less than 45 % this week , the book ’ s return to 2008 has become so tougher .	-5.3921
It wakes up in me the yearning for the many promises that have disbanded in air .	-3.3719
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to make a serious loss against Clinton in the primary elections in Pennsylvania .	-4.1413
In a meeting with the electoral workers after the decision , he told his staff that they would have to come back and follow the purpose of their case .	-5.7266
“ I want us to find our magic again , ” he said .	-2.1285
We must remember who we are .	-1.0028
It is five years later , Mr President , and I could not agree more with you .	-2.2088

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott has conflict of interest on parental leave .	-3.5746
The billionaire and member Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his plans for parental leave because his daughters will become pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .	-4.2623
The Mining magnate , who is in a legal dispute about the payment of $ 6 million in CO2 taxes , claimed that he wanted to wipe questions off the table , whether he was in conflict .	-5.6029
The Palmer United Party could control up to four Senate votes that are important to deciding whether CO2 and mining taxes will be scrapped or reduced .	-4.0328
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest , and the daughters of Abbott personally would benefit from the law .	-2.6295
“ He is in a major conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because if one of his daughters becomes pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not to receive a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.2138
Two months after the election , the Palmer Electoral Commission officially proclaimed the winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coasts , with 53 votes ahead of the new count .	-4.6100
Palmer called for a revision of the counting process to make it faster .	-3.1400
Tony Abbott 's daughters Frances and Bridget .	-1.8511
Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.6611
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-0.8990
Why should we not have a system in which you step in , enter data into a computer , immediately select it and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-5.7156
Palmer also criticised the use of pencil to mark the ballot papers .	-3.5409
Do you use it because you can wipe out the results if you don 't like it ?	-3.8673
It is incredible to vote for pencil pens today .	-5.4542
The Electoral Commission examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-3.0753
Palmer , 59 , explained that his policies include an international airport for the Sunshine Coast and that he will take his new office “ very seriously . ”	-2.7664
A public office is about serving the public .	-2.3973
“ We are seeking no reward other than history , namely that we can serve at a critical time of this community , ” he said .	-3.6672
RBS Pumps Two Forex Dealers	-2.4275
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two foreign currency traders , two of whom are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the worldwide administrative investigation into the alleged currency market manipulation is rapidly gaining ground .	-6.0436
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , have confirmed that they are cooperating with the authorities to investigate the world ’ s largest financial market , where US $ 5.3 trillion is exchanged daily .	-5.0657
The two traders would be the first RBS staff to be suspended in the widening investigation that is taking on the scandal of the Libor Interbank business .	-5.0555
The Bank , which did not comment on suspending crimes , confirmed this month that it received requests for information from authorities .	-4.7012
“ Our investigation on this issue continues and we are cooperating fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-3.6387
Last month , people close to the situation reported that the RBS forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to a former merchant to the UK Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-4.8642
This merchant , Richard Uher , had left the RBS in 2010 and has since been certified by his current position as European leader of forex trading in JPMorgan .	-7.7846
Rohan Ramchandani , Head of European Spot Trading at Citi , was judged this week and Matt Gardiner , formerly leading currency traders at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-4.2832
None of these traders were accused of some wrongdoing .	-2.7987
Bankers at Barclays and Citigroup were part of the Uher Instant Message Group , said people close to the situation .	-4.0025
UBS announced this week that it has taken steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority , Finma , has stated that it is seeking a suspected manipulation of the Forex market with a number of Swiss banks .	-6.0981
At least six authorities around the world – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Department of Justice , and Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently discussing allegations that bankers should have agreed to deal with monetary transactions .	-5.7078
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received requests for information from authorities , said with the situation of familiar persons .	-3.3428
Banks hack Instant Messages and emails from several years in search of misconduct cases .	-3.4615
The news about this research has put traders in turmoil in an area that has been one of the most profitable of investment banks ’ trading units in recent years , but this year has been under pressure , because low volatility in currencies reduces the opportunities for speculators .	-5.9661
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the vast and highly liquid foreign exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-4.0713
A leading trader noted that , despite the huge daily volume in foreign exchange trading , the fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the growing use of their own internal platforms by banks leads to banks “ already influencing the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-6.6172
The news came out on the same day as Credit Suisse announced that it had terminated a trader of its London Exchange Traded Funds office this week after he lost almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-5.2153
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-2.4367
“ We are sure that the trader acted alone and that the matter has been curbed , ” said Credit Suisse .	-4.3926
paint the Bauzaun on the Bechtle-Land	-3.3977
A group of the citizens ' initiative " Swiss meadow " has embellished the Bauzaun on the Bechtle plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.7621
She also shrunk and widened the walk , it is called in a press release .	-5.4377
The planned cover of the crumbling house in the back part of the property had not been allowed for security reasons , because the site is in danger of slipping .	-7.8408
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the plot , had agreed to the beautification action with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI .	-4.3024
Before the action of the BI , a banner was issued with the message ' We are in favour ' .	-4.0863
However , this did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative in their actions .	-3.3823
Their motto on the big poster was ' We are against ruins ' .	-3.3152
In doing so she wanted to point out the danger of even larger ruins on the Swiss meadow - the giant project should one day fail .	-4.7171
When talking to many passers-by before the " construction site " it became clear that some citizens believe that implementing the city project would be better for many , although few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-6.3151
But they are beginning to resignate because the city is delaying these responses further , it is said by the BI .	-3.7875
As we have heard , the mayor 's public statements also have a bearing on their .	-5.3955
In May , the Council of Ministers said that he was afraid of leaving the thermal bath , should the public vote against plans for a spa and wellness complex on the Swiss meadow .	-6.5419
Some seem to be alarmed for that reason , while others consider them to be " crude blackmail " at the population , the BI ’ s press release continues to be .	-7.8601
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all the helpers .	-2.9551
Rannick Sheet for Schiki : Mane no Queen of Schwal.	-7.0533
Ralf Rannick is pleased with the current high form of Bundesliga table leader Red Bull Salzburg , so the sports director of the " Bullen " was disappointed by the arbitrators .	-4.2624
" There is currently a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of gay kings , " he took protection of the two offensive wirkller on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg .	-5.4100
The most recent occasion for Rannick ’ s criticism was Gelb for Mane at 3 : 0 against Gröndig last Sunday , in which Senegal became an alleged showdown - which , however , was not as the TV images showed .	-9.0912
" A stark misdecision " , Rannick said , the referee Harcame called " completely overstretched " .	-4.9281
Harkam would also have contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and the Gardena coach Adi Hütter after the match .	-3.7965
He defended his German compatriot : " I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every single situation . "	-5.7295
After the skirmish , Schmidt himself would not have had any contact with his colleague . , , and .	-5.4221
I do not know why .	-1.1223
" For I am the one who was offended , " stressed the 46-year-old .	-3.1997
However , in view of the success story , Rannick agreed a hymn of praise .	-5.7289
" There are only two words for this : correct . " He said .	-3.7058
There is not much to blame .	-2.5048
The way the team plays is particularly impressive .	-1.7858
This should continue .	-3.2810
There will be little change in the winter transfer time .	-3.5131
There are no great reasons to change anything .	-1.8766
" Apart from a player 's desire to leave the club , " Rannick clearly stated .	-4.5537
Supreme Court corroborates Obama ’ s Health Act Supreme	-3.4189
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : US Supreme Court decided today that the closely linked health-care law is constitutional .	-4.0837
With five votes to four , the judges ruled that the individual mandate of the patient Protection and Affordable Care Act – forcing US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a penalty by 2014 – is constitutional under the state ’ s tax authority .	-5.1962
The Supreme Judge John Roberts proposed the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy decided against .	-4.6050
The Court also upheld the remaining sections of the 2700 pages of the law , and also argued that the provisions of the health law that states should either extend the access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state aid for Medicaid should not be unconstitutional .	-8.2259
The lawsuit was instigated by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-2.4043
The law was strongly rejected by all leading Republican presidential candidates , including Mitt Romney ’ s eventual challenger .	-3.1421
Norway : The World ’ s Giant Light	-4.6375
With huge mirrors , the inhabitants of a Norwegian village have brought light to their dark valley .	-3.4139
Due to the low level of sunshine , the Rjukan , situated in the Vestfjord valley , usually blows from fall to spring in the shadow of the surrounding mountains .	-5.7827
With three giant reflectors at a height of 45 metres , a century-old building was built on Wednesday .	-5.5909
" Finally ! " , waxed Mayor Steinar Bergsland at the start ceremony in broadcaster TV2 .	-3.2595
Some of the Taleans were able to handle solar panels , others set up sunglasses for safety reasons .	-6.3551
Until now , sun-seekers had to reach a nearby peak in winter with a cable car .	-4.1654
Ten years ago , the local artist Martin Andersen presented the proposal to shift radiation to the valley with mirrors .	-3.1918
However , this idea had been in place since 1913 .	-4.4913
After several years of debate , the town council eventually adopted the 5 million crowns ( about 615 000 euros ) expensive project .	-4.5825
The Italian Alpine resort of Viganella has been providing a similar construction for several years .	-7.2146
Post leert barely Sunday	-1.5551
" Many citizens will not have noticed it yet , the red points for Sunday ledding are still on various letter boxes in the heart of the city and the parts of the city , but you read the small print on the yellow containers of the Post AG , you quickly find out that the space on Sundays and holidays no longer takes place " , shares the FDP .	-7.8861
A FDP request has confirmed this .	-2.9750
On Sundays and public holidays , only in front of the post building at Ernst-Ludwig-Stra<unk>e 36 and in the Jakob-Müller-Stra<unk>e 1 in Hüttenfeld are emptied .	-4.8234
Whether it is sowed in Hofheim and Rosengarten on Sunday , the answer to the FDP question will not be answered .	-4.7808
The FDP ’ s Social and Youth Policy spokesman , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to chase here .	-4.8872
Sunday leaning is an important post service at the same time .	-4.7807
" This undertaking has been radically and unacceptably diluted despite the increase in prices for letters in January 2013 " .	-4.3471
Thomas Bittner , the Liberal Group 's members of parliament , supports his group 's colleagues : " What annoys me is the fact that here , in secret , the periods of space are changed or removed " .	-6.7453
The post office is a long way from being close to the citizens .	-5.0643
" At least , the post boxes in the districts of Neuschlo<unk> and Rosengarten must be emptied again on Sundays " , as Bittner and Röhrenbeck unison .	-7.9685
Even for the core city , especially non-mobile fellow citizens would have to be able to reach a postbox with a sunday leaning on foot .	-6.7298
In the municipal district of Röhrenbeck asked whether the town administration plans discussions with the post office on this matter .	-5.7682
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lamberheim .	-1.8356
His knowledge , however , also gave a Sunday ledding in Hofheim .	-6.0732
Your party was in favour of privatisation .	-2.8636
" Then decisions are taken elsewhere , " Maier said .	-1.6809
Frankfurt ’ s park fees are to rise sharply .	-5.9768
Parking in Frankfurt could be more expensive soon .	-4.0689
This morning the city ’ s main station advises Stefan Majer ( Green ) on a presentation of traffic plans .	-7.0541
Parking charges should therefore be increased by 50 % .	-2.6683
This does not mean that the prices should be higher , but rather the intervals of parking and ticket machines should be reduced from 30 to 20 minutes .	-10.5542
In December , the City Council will have to decide .	-3.0171
The retail committee of the IHK Frankfurt considers this " not a good idea " .	-3.0295
The possibility to park directly in front of the shop is " an advantage not to be underestimated for smaller dealers " .	-5.5736
The German Sports Club believes that an increase after two decades is " quite appropriate and long overdue " .	-4.5327
Public transport will also become more expensive .	-3.1376
Freudian : Prompt Actions Overrides Host	-5.2312
With a narrow cader , the gentlemen I of TSV Freudenstadt had to compete against the TG Gönningen from the Swabian Alb in the Schiller-Schulturnhalle in Reutlingen .	-5.2400
The older ones were with an experienced team on the other side of the net .	-3.5699
But soon it became apparent that , even according to age , they could not fully compete with the fast actions of the joys .	-6.1228
With the hard and burnished , the Gönninger did very hard .	-5.3821
They repeatedly passed the passes and attacks played by Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz smoothly over the middle of the net and were not there for the block defense .	-5.8874
Two high first satzwin clearly expressed the superiority of the joys in all aspects .	-5.0813
In view of this stifling and playful performance , the third set was won somewhat sloppy and fun to the 3 : 0-final level ( 25 : 13 , 25 : 14 , 25 : 22 ) .	-6.7118
On November 2nd , the TV Baiersbronn , who had a clear victory in Nagold , will be a far more powerful opponent .	-6.8577
TSV Freudenstadt I : Dominik Bäuerle , Yannik Büchle , Sebastian Dölker , Felix Pärchen , Stefan raller , Simon Schenk and Eduard Schulz .	-2.9159
In the B-class the second teams from Baiersbronn and Freudenstadt were faced in the Murgtalhalle in Baiersbronn .	-4.1117
They delivered a tough two-hour match .	-1.5528
Conspiracy on both sides caused errors and point angles in particular ; in the passports too , the precision was sometimes lacking , and in some critical playing scenes , the overzeal prevented the eye for possible score gains .	-11.2047
In this performance very balanced encounter , Marcus Blasutto ’ s TSV team consistently voted for the great physical effort and a pleasing commitment of both teams .	-7.0651
Keeping Day for the Small English hut	-4.2429
A group of dedicated participants met at the small English hut in Ibach to follow the Natura 2000 project .	-5.7148
Due to popular suggestions , this day in the area of the hut should be cut freely to the valley , Mayor Helmut Kaiser said .	-4.0526
Many hikers named this area as the pearl of the gorge , where the landscape provides the ideal setting for wonderful views .	-6.5987
He thanked those present for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the caring day is a suitable tool for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-4.9605
It gives every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .	-4.0870
At the same time , ecological consideration could also be given to tourism .	-6.6028
This ecological aspect was explained by Friederike Tribukait from the Department of Conservation of the Government of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who had taken over the patronage and wanted the action to be a good success .	-6.7631
According to Tribukait , the tourist goal of the far-sightedness is to preserve the old Allmendweidfeld , which has now grown rapidly , with its specific protected types of life , by opening up and connecting to the still existing pastures .	-8.2879
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grasshoppers , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces .	-2.1517
You need these free connections to the artery .	-3.1441
Tribukait said she would not miss this point to break a lance for the planned biosphere .	-4.2118
In this planning , the current measure does not just go smoothly .	-3.0898
A biosphere area also offers an opportunity for sustainable economic and environmental development based on the internationally recognized Unesco status and thus a continuous extension of the project with the Life-project and the previous care days achieved for the future .	-7.0527
After these various comments , Reviermanager Christoph Wehle and Life-Project Manager Cornelia Bischoff shared the helper in groups .	-5.8475
The larger trees had already been hit in advance and if necessary , the forest drag is ready .	-6.1374
A group of helpers should take care of the release of wax hangers and the maintenance of a dry-stone rifle .	-6.0651
The aim was to have a free view of the viewpoint .	-3.9695
Löffingen : Köpler ’ s Only Candidate	-4.1147
Information on the Internet : Although the town of Löffingen with its 7514 inhabitants , an intact infrastructure , a forward-looking school , children 's , youth and senior citizens policy , as well as its own towns , can be described as an attractive city , no second mayor has asked .	-9.3859
The only candidate to succeed Norbert Brugger , who is no longer a candidate for old age , is the 46-year-old bankman and business manager Dieter Köpfler from Löffingen .	-10.4957
The deadline for application expires on Monday , 11 November at 6 p.m.	-3.5627
Google , Samsung , Huawei sued because of Nortel patents .	-1.8236
The group , which has thousands of former Nortel patents , made an avalanche of complaints about patent infringement against mobile manufacturers , including Google , the company that he outbid in Nortel ’ s insolvency auction .	-5.6146
Rockstar , the consortium that the Nortel patent had bought for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringement before the US ezir court in Texas .	-4.3207
Rockstar is a collective property of Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-3.3600
Google is accused in seven cases of patent infringement .	-1.9497
Patents for technology that match search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , such as the complaint that hits the core of Google 's search engine business .	-5.0393
Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar representatives were not directly accessible .	-2.3218
Samsung , Huawei and HTC create mobile phones that work with Google 's operating system Android , which is in sharp competition with the mobile products of Apple and Microsoft .	-3.1916
In 2011 , Google launched an initial bid of more than $ 900 million for the Nortel .	-3.2147
Google has increased its supply several times and last offered $ 4.4 billion .	-4.7084
After being outbid at Rockstar ’ s Nortel patents , Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a business that was also motivated by Motorola ’ s library of patents .	-5.7645
“ Although Google has failed to purchase the auction cover , Google has violated and continues to do so , ” the parenthesis says .	-6.0901
Rockstar is demanding heavy damages from Google because it claims that Google 's patent infringement is intentional , so the accusation .	-4.0780
Egypt sworn in the first freely elected president	-3.1509
Mohammed Morsi is sworn in , but his day of Triumph is unlikely to mean the end of the political disputes in Egypt .	-3.9751
Islam ’ s Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was sworn into the country ’ s first freely elected president , thus ending Hosni Mubarak , who had been expelled from office for 16 months .	-4.8173
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamic president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth leader since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-3.2649
He laid the oath before the 18 judges of the court dressed in black robes , who had his seat at the Nile and lived up to an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.3814
“ We are striving for a better future , a new Egypt and a second republic , ” Morsi said at the ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-3.4655
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundation for a new life – absolute freedom , real democracy and stability , ” said the 60-year-old Morsi , a US-educated engineer and a member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group that has been widely targeted by the government since its formation 84 years ago .	-5.0623
Hundreds of soldiers and police supervised the building when Morsi arrived in a small autoconvoi shortly after 11 o 'clock local time .	-3.9457
Only a few hundred followers had gathered in the court to celebrate the new president , and , unlike the presidential-Prunk of the Mubarak era , traffic was suspended only for a short time , so that the autoconvoi could cross the usually busy street connecting the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-7.7551
As an uncharismatic “ spare wheel ” of the Brotherhood , its personal prestige has increased since its victory and a Friday speech , presenting itself not only as a candidate of Islamists , but all those who wanted to target the 2011 insurgency against the authoritarian Mubarak .	-5.5032
“ Egypt today is a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” the Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red tie , declared the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he presided .	-4.4791
Later , Morsi moved to Cairo University , where he should keep his inaugural address .	-2.8526

Salem : Johanna Rahner in the Ecumenical Discussion Forum	-2.1441
At the next Ecumenical Discussion Forum on Monday , 21 October , in the New Museum of the Castle , we are dealing with the theme of ' hell with hell - Theological reflections on the way things are handled today ' .	-7.0814
He is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-2.2844
The Ecumenical Discussion Forum is an initiative by the Catholic and evangelical Church communities of Salem , the Salem Castle and the Culture Office of the Bodensee Region .	-4.3116
Johanna Rahner wants to follow up in the forum of the question as to how people think the " last things " after death .	-4.8664
If people had known too much of this over the past centuries , putting on the images of heaven and hell , " which still shape our ideas " , contemporary prophetic teachings of hopes of completion would be characterized by a certain embarrassment or even speechless .	-8.3781
" The greater hope has been given to Christians by religious criticism , " says the speaker .	-4.0222
You have ' provided us with so many question marks that the exclamations seem to have come to us ' .	-4.5397
Johanna Rahner continues to say : " But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death . "	-3.3514
This is linked to the question of longing , ' which dreams that everything will be good at the end ' .	-5.3158
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic theology and biology at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-5.0306
She earned a Ph.D. in 1997 as Dr. theol .	-4.5358
The Habilitation for Fundamental theology and the Ecumenical theology followed in 2003 at the Westfälische Wilhelms-Universität .	-3.6134
Since 2010 , Johanna Rahner holds a Chair of Systematic Theology at the Institute of Catholic Theology of the University of Kassel .	-3.3376

Illmensee : Second mountain bike race enthusiastic participants	-2.5129
In fine weather , 214 cyclists arrived to Illmensee in order to complete the round course over the hills surrounding the lake .	-6.2614
This is shared by Ulrich Knobel from the organizing sports club Illmensee .	-3.9384
Among the participants , especially at the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , there were also many jedermann-bikers who wanted to practise their hobby once in a competitive atmosphere .	-7.6101
Two top German junior drivers were also at the start of this race : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation good places at the German championships .	-6.0816
These two were expected to move from the field .	-3.8651
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a little bit of time ahead to the target and defended his title as the overall winner of the short distance .	-5.7092
Pascal Treubel was again placed on second .	-5.2317
In the ladies it was Teresa Duelli of Team Alnightmare who made it to the top of the podium .	-5.5832
Two and three Anne Adel from Illmensee and Leonie drivers came from Owingen .	-3.0876
A pleasant development is the increasing number of drivers living or working in the municipality .	-3.1615
It was not only in terms of capacity that the whole range of athletes was represented .	-4.6839
The age structure also depended on the oldest winners , from ten years old .	-6.0562
In the main race were even more absolute top athletes this year .	-3.5008
Four drivers were able to leave from the top regional riders .	-3.6890
Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semiprofile from the Black-Tusk Racing team .	-3.4870

Dr. Georges Bwave brings free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon .	-2.7153
Bwave and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients .	-2.4877
In the West African country , there are not many doctors , only one for 5,000 people .	-2.1549

Dr. Georges Bwave is one of the top 10 of CNN Heroes of 2013 .	-3.3195
You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to vote for the CNN Hero of the Year .	-3.1428
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-2.3287
For 21 years , Georges Bwave saw his sick father losing consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-4.7553
Jamef Bwave was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaondé , the capital of Cameroon .	-4.7805
First of all , he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation spread over his brain and caused a hematop that should affect him for the rest of his life .	-5.9841
“ There were no neurosurgery in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwave .	-3.0928
We would have put it out of Cameroon if we had had the money .	-2.4033
Instead , Bwave spent years accompanying his father to overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-7.0920
“ It is not easy , ” comments Bwave .	-2.0829
You can leave the house at five o ’ clock and run to the hospital to be the first , and you are not the first .	-5.8502
There are many patients .	-1.2873
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.2998
The situation has hardly changed since Bwell 's father died in 2002 .	-2.7801
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people , according to the World Health Organization .	-3.6703
In comparison , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor of 413 people .	-3.6295
But even if there were a doctor for them , most Cameroon ’ s patients could not afford to visit .	-5.0911
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line and nearly three-quarters of health spending in the country are private .	-2.9858
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwave .	-1.9178
And poverty makes life impossible .	-0.9960
His father and so many of his compatriots were suffering to see Bwave 's decision to do something about it .	-5.1327
Dr. Georges Bwave and his team of volunteers carried out 700 free operations over the past year .	-3.3654
He became a doctor and was working as a vessel surgeon at the Central Hospital in Yaondé .	-4.3707
He also founded a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels to rural areas on weekends and offers free medical care .	-4.2199
Since 2008 , he and his volunteers have helped nearly 32,000 people .	-2.1970
Almost every Friday he and up to 30 people are forced into minibuses and drive on the roof over unpaved terrain into the villages that need help .	-5.6707
Not always proceed smoothly .	-2.3476
They had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud more than once .	-2.9931
But when they arrive , they are received like heroes : a feast , song , dance and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-4.2209
In these villages , free medical care really is a reason to celebrate , and Bwave – with its broad smile and unlimited energy – is happy to be part of the happy celebration .	-5.0351
The next morning the team starts to investigate hundreds of patients .	-2.7774
“ We treat 500 people per ride ” , according to Bwave .	-3.4021
They come from a 60 km radius around the village – and on foot .	-3.8929
Each of these weekend clinics offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.7215
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually transmitted diseases .	-1.7624
Others receive crutches , donated glasses or free birth certificates – a document that is required for school , but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-4.0714
In the evening , the team will perform simple local operations .	-2.9856
The operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the procedure the patients are up and go to the recreation area to make room for the next .	-6.0405
The lighting for the OP and the disinfectant is fed by the generator of the group , so Bwave and his volunteers work until the early morning hours on Sunday .	-5.3076
It is an exhausting pensum , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-2.8034
“ It strolls all night so that we can stay awake and continue our work , ” says Bwave .	-4.3584
On Sunday the team will return to the city , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.5571
The group – a mixture of Cameroonian doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations over the past year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people it helps .	-5.0319
A man explained that the free operation of a bar break he received now allows him to work again .	-4.8016
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.7563
In addition to the weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in the hospital , Bwave also works in private clinics in Yaondé at night .	-3.9656
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his nonprofit activities , according to Bwave ; the rest comes from private donations .	-4.1021
“ I really do not know when he is sleeping , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who in the second year is studying at Drexel University in Philadelphia medicine and working voluntarily in Bwelles Group .	-5.0070
He is always at the hospital or trying to get money for the organisation so that he can go into these campaigns .	-4.2763
For medical and health care students such as O 'Malley , who come from the US and Europe and support Bwave , this is an opportunity to gain practical experience that they would never have at home .	-4.6279
“ We can be doing operations where we help to tap blood or keep the instruments for Dr. Bwave , ” says O 'Malley .	-5.5571
That would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.7894
The students usually pay for their trip to Cameroon and bring frequently donated relief material .	-4.7367
Once in Yanoundé , Bwave takes care of accommodation , transportation and instruction .	-6.0692
“ He is certainly a hero , ” says O 'Malley .	-2.1817
He is dedicated to his life of this organization and his desire to help the Cameroonian people knows no boundaries .	-2.9666
The almost constant work is not a burden for Bwave .	-3.6668
To give others a happier life and thereby fulfill a promise that he has given his father , gives him great joy .	-6.4277
“ I am so happy when I do this work , ” says Bwave .	-3.3175
And I think of my father .	-1.3570
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.0343
I do it to make people laugh again and to relieve pain .	-2.7770

Performing the Battle	-2.8709
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway Novell " The Old Man and the Sea " , is cut to the body by Horst Janson .	-3.3086
Janson is himself an old Hase in his butcher , the art of acting .	-4.1046
The old man Santiago can 't pretend to be fishing .	-3.7474
So the two are simply great .	-3.3757
You almost think you can see the hawks of the old man , the fisherman 's young Manolo .	-5.9531
When Santiago is tired of life bursting on the chair , Janson is real .	-4.9090
Janson played the role of the old fisherman .	-5.5064
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a brave man who does not give up and ultimately wins the battle against the fish by his knowledge and also his will .	-3.8951
Janson is a single actor on stage for a large number of years .	-5.4348
He manages to focus the audience ’ s attention on itself , so his monologues are no moment boring .	-3.9370
His efforts to finally pull the fish to the surface of water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists of blue lit water bottles .	-7.3388
Director Jens Hasselmann lets the old man act in the boat in front of the fishing village .	-2.8432
In the course of the performance he puts the active scene in the spotlight : The Hub of Santiago , the bar of singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who , with her songs and her wonderful voice , captures Cuba 's sense of life .	-7.6156
The four musicians play Cuba 's rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-2.3651
Tourism : Descending to the	-3.9617
On a length of about 120 metres , a Roman wastewater channel is available below Cologne .	-6.0103
When visiting Cologne , the Cathedral is not over .	-4.1889
Around 157 meters the two towers towers rise into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-3.4727
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigree storms suggest that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-5.9120
Rainer Schulze is an expert in matters of Cologne underworld .	-2.6505
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne Tourism directly at the Duomo .	-3.7140
The tour starts very spectacular : " We start in the underground car park " , says Schulze .	-3.7153
In the seventies , the city 's fathers wanted an autocratic city , and that is why the remnants of the old city wall stood only for what was not too big .	-7.1648
Most of the users of the parking garage today also pass the Roman remains and only leave their car .	-6.2103
But if you look more closely , on the D2 parking deck you will find an archaeological site separated by metal grid rods .	-6.5207
About five meters high ruins are made of handmade stones .	-5.1009
" The remains of the Roman city wall , which was built in the second half of the first century after Christ , " tells Schulze .	-3.5107
Before it comes to light again , Schulze allows participants at the upper level to take a look into a dark 15 m deep shaft .	-6.9237
This is the well of the old cathedral , which is hardly noticed .	-3.4754
The next stop of the round is the prairium , and here the participants climb down to the depth .	-6.1483
We are witnessing the seat of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the seat of the CCAA .	-4.2562
What CCAA means is that a visitor would like to know .	-2.3908
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinnese " , which in good German means " the city of Roman law and the city of Agrippinese , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the altar of the Imperial Sculpture " .	-8.7709
And the Pretorium is the former palace of implantments , the centre of power of the Roman Empire on the Rhine .	-4.9996
From the entrance of the exhibition there is a tunnel access to the Roman sewage channel , which is maintained here for about 120 metres .	-5.0393
" You can quietly walk a piece along the so called Cloaca Maxima if you want " , cheers up the guests .	-6.3172
There is still a surprise to Schulze .	-2.9246
After taking the key to the cashier , he leads the group to a 16-meter deep , passable shaft .	-5.2205
" We are now in the Mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.4340
The Jewish community built its own bathroom deep into the ground to access the groundwater , which was essential for the ritual washing .	-5.1574
Today , in the lower end of the Mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different water levels are visible by varying levels of the Rhine .	-5.7296
The Mikwe will be part of an archaeological area on the Town Hall Square , for which construction work is due to begin shortly .	-4.3406
However , it will take a few years to complete .	-4.2507
Nearly hacked : New Rise of Rocker Process	-4.1065

A trial of fogging , dangerous bodily injury and material damage to two 30 years of age has begun in the District Court Frankfurt ( or ) .	-7.3717
It is accompanied by strict safety measures .	-2.0119
The accused swear to the start .	-2.1007
They should have been active in the rockers scene and heard one of the Bandidos at that time .	-5.1355
The Public Prosecutor 's Office accuses them of having caught in a car in June 2009 together with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt .	-5.1577
All victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-2.6824
Victims should have been part of the competing Hells Angels faction .	-4.0171
One should have been a senior member from Berlin .	-1.8838
Apparently there was a hunt for persecution with several cars .	-3.9627
According to the indictment , it was about raids and a demonstration of power .	-3.4615
The two accused were released in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .	-2.2197
A court spokesman then said that it was impossible to prove that men were actually involved in the bloody feuding .	-4.7341
The perpetrators had masks worn and were not recognized .	-2.0182
The Federal Court of Justice lifted the judgment after the review of the Public Prosecutor and referred it back to the District Court for renegotiation .	-4.3946
One of the accused is currently in open execution due to another offence .	-6.4460
At the start , it was mainly a matter of re-engineering the procedures in the evening of the day .	-6.9295
As a witness was the Commissioner who was identified at the time .	-2.9189
In the center were mobile phone calls from the accused and other people who had stopped the police .	-4.2641
It is difficult that Rocker is almost always in court to comply with an established law for them - and not to tell .	-7.4996
This also applies to the victims .	-1.6673
In the first process , only one of the victims had unwrapped .	-2.4186
Public prosecutor Stefan Golliger of the Public Prosecutor Frankfurt ( or ) said that there have been new traces since the last trial .	-4.7266
11 further days of negotiations are planned for the process .	-3.6424
The Wegwerfgesellschaft does not think	-1.6134
The night was long , the music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .	-2.2384
The only thing is that hunger is noticeable in people ’ s bakeries on the front-passenger and rear seat .	-6.1510
Of course , you may be responsible for one or other cocktail or champagne !	-3.8346
What ’ s more , than getting chilled to the next Drive-In to get a bit of a treat ?	-6.9654
I admit that I am happy to attend when late in the afternoon or early in the morning to fastfood .	-7.0041
A couple of Pomps , a Cola , a Burger - and then nix as from home and into bed !	-3.3962
But on the way home the obvious differences between me and other hungry disco geese are noticeable .	-3.9341
Because what do you not think you throw your fast food bags out of the car window with a constant regularity ?	-7.1021
At weekends in particular , paper bags that have been turned away at street edges and parking places .	-6.1348
" Why ? " , I ask myself .	-1.1906
Are people too doof to take the bags home respectful to the next rubbish bin ?	-3.2273
It is not just the case that the paper is being wrapped up in the landscape .	-5.1185
Transport facilities , such as control plans , have already been uncovered and thus caused accidents .	-6.0723
However , it does not even know what this word actually means .	-5.1092
If you ’ re travelling more often in the evening , especially with several people in the car , you ’ ll know what a return bank can look like after celebrated nights : Klamotten , Bottles and other garbage towers there .	-7.9889
A couple of bags would make a difference more or less - in contrast to the street , where no one wants to trample on the leftovers of other rumpfle.	-7.8200
I can see the day when the towns and communities will be able to clean the ground - and the fast-food chains must demand deposit for their bags .	-7.9106
Obama ’ s Health-Care Returns	-3.1218
After heavy criticism , President Obama backtracked on his frequent , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-4.5956
After hundreds of thousands of their insurers received a letter of termination , the Republicans have urged the president in recent days to deceive the American public .	-3.8572
Yesterday , Obama made his original promise .	-1.6480
“ The vast majority of citizens who have effective health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.3395
In response to the numerous media reports on redundancies , Obama urged those Americans who received such communications to look around on the free market for new insurance .	-4.6269
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price or better than predicted .	-4.3661
“ They come a better offer , ” he said .	-2.6621
The government described it as little surprising that the five per cent of the population who have signed an insurance policy would have to look at another rate , because their contract does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-6.8724
“ I would like to say to these Americans quite directly : they deserve better , ” he said Sevelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Committee on Energy and Trade in Washington . the were , , and . were . were . were . were were	-8.9359
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , explained that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserably ” since October .	-3.3322
“ I am as frustrated and angry as everyone else , ” she said .	-1.9203
I am determined to regain your trust .	-1.5474
This proclamation of a bloated Sebelius as a consultant behind her sitting at yesterday 's House of Representatives was received after a dispute with Republican MP Billy Long from Missouri , asking whether she should be committed to taking part in Obamacare .	-7.5780
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the Affordable Care Act ’ s “ Architectins ” did not voluntarily dispense with state-sponsored insurance in order to conclude a tariff at HealthCare.gov , which she now wants to sell millions of Americans .	-6.8179
Jerusalem ’ s Jerusalem Government does not confirm attack on Syria ’ s Air Force Point	-7.4283
An American official who wanted to remain anonymous , on Thursday told the American news channel CNN that Israeli warplanes had attacked an airbase in Syria ’ s Latakia one day earlier .	-6.8108
The objective was ' missiles and related equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared were destined for Lebanese Hezbollah , says CNN .	-4.7572
Syrians and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port city of Latakia was bombed on Thursday at night , and the Israelis held responsibility for it .	-6.8502
The Israeli Channel 2 showed satellite images of the Latakia base on which Russian defence missiles of type S-125 Newa and a SA-3 rocket battery could be seen , according to Channel 2 , with a range of 35 kilometres and warheads carrying up to 70 kilograms .	-8.5419
Uncertain , the Jerusalem Government has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.5270
However , the news agency Reuters cites an equally anonymous Israeli government official in the words that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but not sure .	-5.4396
In any case , a spokesman from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-4.0262
The journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized in the daily newspaper Yediith Ahronoth that the Syrian regime has already tried , partly successfully , to supply ground air missiles to Hezbollah .	-4.3416
The Israeli Government has repeatedly warned that any attempt by Syria to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons means exceeding a " red line " that would follow a military response .	-3.0896
John Kerry , in an unprecedented admission that the US espionage has gone “ unreasonably far . ”	-3.7249
With an unexpected acknowledgement , John Kerry indicated a softening of the US ’ s defenceless stance on its surveillance programs by saying that , in certain cases , the espionage had gone “ unreasonably far . ”	-8.5898
The Foreign Minister also admitted that he , together with Barack Obama , was responsible for using “ autopilot ” when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden were made public about NSA espionage activities .	-5.3640
The leaked information has led the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation by its allies .	-3.5328
In a speech made by video , at the Open Government Conference in London , Kerry said : “ The President and I , along with others in the government , have learned of a number of things that have almost ended up by car pilot , simply because the ability was there for what was going back to World War II and the difficult years of the Cold War , and , of course , to 11 September . ”	-8.1233
He then admitted , as the first senior member of the US government , that the US spy had crossed a border , but he also stressed that no rights had been abused .	-4.2705
He said : “ In some cases , this went unreasonably too far . ”	-3.4877
The President is determined to clarify the situation and therefore carries out a thorough investigation so that no one must feel that abuses take place .	-5.3293
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-2.2392
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good and was saved many lives by monitoring .	-3.6370
He added : “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are ready to blow themselves up . ”	-2.7139
There is a radical extremism in the world that is obsessed with killing people , blowing the air , and attacking governments .	-4.1345
So what if we were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?	-3.0654
In fact , we have prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the killing of people because we have experienced such plans .	-4.7022
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about America ’ s perceived espionage , and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US in the anti-terrorism effort , as the chairman of the Senate Committee on European Affairs said on Thursday .	-5.4501
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week , worried about their threats to stop taking part in anti-terrorism organisations because of their frustration with the monitoring by the National Security Agency .	-5.0820
“ It is very important for the US ’ s national security interests to keep Europeans on board with regard to our joint efforts to combat terrorism , ” Murphy , who , for the first time , is in the Senate and is active as chairman of the Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs , said in an interview in Washington .	-5.6852
I am also going to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger at the NSA programmes .	-5.7672
Media reports that have captured millions of telephone data in Europe have strained relations with some US allies , even though the leader of the secret service said this week that the reports were incorrect and based on a misunderstanding of the metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.6589
Other revelations quoted from Snowden ’ s documents that the NSA oversaw German Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone and up to 34 other leaders worldwide .	-4.4978
The head of national secret services , James Clapper , defended espionage by allies as necessary and said that it was common on both sides .	-4.4882
In all the tumult , Murphy said that his authority made the trip to Congress to be held this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members from both parties and chambers .	-5.1384
The names of the other participating Members will be published in the coming days .	-2.3054
He said that the exact itinerary is still being worked out .	-2.6771
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey is to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . ”	-3.2974
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of espionage programmes they have been using for years .	-3.1372
“ Although we can change our surveillance programmes and thus better protect the rights of Europeans , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” says Murphy .	-4.3475
Meanwhile , John Kerry ’ s weekend trip to the Middle East and Poland to address the resentment of the US strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , and US surveillance activities .	-4.2506
A persistent violation of the springboard threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Bundesliga forward game of FSV Mainz 05 at FC Augsburg .	-11.4447
Mainz bnagt um eine Anwendung von Nicolai Müller .	-2.1755
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.2767
So far , he could only do that individually .	-3.4181
" We will decide on his commitment in the short term , " said Trainer Thomas Tuchel .	-4.7000
The 40-year-old hopes to have the best torturers with six strikes .	-3.8108

Australia appealed against prison sentences in Thailand	-3.2176
A 21-year-old Sydney woman sentenced to 15 days in prison in Phuket for wrongly claiming to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the sentence and was released on bail .	-3.0962
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty by a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false message after telling the Thai police , a local taxi driver raped her during the morning hours of Sunday 10 June , while two other men held her .	-5.7921
Later , however , a video camera showed that she had arrived safely in her hotel after she had been separated from her Australian friend .	-5.9333
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they began to think up history .	-4.8204
It was in police custody until the court had jurisdiction .	-4.6487
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison in a low-level prison on the outskirts of Phuket , rather than in a prison for adult women .	-3.4109
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former Australian Rubgy League player who addressed to the State Department in Canberra with a request for help for his daughter .	-4.8591
Tunk explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family is “ extremely concerned ” about the welfare of his daughter and wanted to have her back in Australia .	-3.9443
“ Of course , we are very concerned , but we hope that it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-4.9792
Bamford appealed against the ruling and is open for bail of 50,000 Baht .	-3.7739
In Australian reports it has been read that in the meantime , she is making a holiday at Krabi resort in South Thailand .	-6.4769
The court had to hear that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket and warned that the appeal could also lead to the imposition of a higher sentence of up to two years in a adult prison .	-5.6746
However , it is also possible that Thailand , following the recent murder of Michelle Smith , in Phuket , may try to improve its beaten tourist image , and therefore come to an acquittal .	-7.0679
