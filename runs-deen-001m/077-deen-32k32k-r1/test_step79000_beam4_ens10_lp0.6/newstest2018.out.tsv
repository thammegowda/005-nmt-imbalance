Munich 1856 : Four cards that alter your view of the city .	-3.9266
A miraculous development where young people are to encounter today .	-5.1190
A mine chapel where you can now dig for the S-Bahn tunnel .	-3.7837
Kleingärtner managed the former cause of farmers .	-3.6794
The oldest official card in Munich promotes exciting stories .	-2.7550
It happens when maps are not up to date .	-2.9288
Everyone who had to get out of the air because the auto Navi was looking for a green meadow instead of a walkway .	-6.5934
The historical maps of the Bayern Atlas , an offer by the Bavarian State Government , are anything but up-to-date , but they are very revealing .	-6.4081
Especially when compared to current online cards .	-2.4847
Then it becomes clear how cities and municipalities have changed in the surroundings of Munich ’ s Mercury region since the 19th century .	-4.9275
The digital Bayern-Atlas is a patchwork that is not immediately recognized .	-4.5732
In the large overview map , more detailed maps , so-called maps of the cities and municipalities , were incorporated .	-7.1285
These were created according to the Bavarian survey board between 1810 and 1864 and came from the first measurement of Bavaria .	-6.3767
Your client : Napoleon .	-0.9413
The French army leader occupied Bavaria since the spring of 1800 during the second coalition war with Austria .	-3.4940
Napoleon desired an overview of the occupied land and commissioned a topographic admission of Bavaria - for military purposes , of course .	-4.9106
Although the French troops , with the Lunéville peace of February 9 , 1801 , finally withdrew : it was today 's neighbors that created the idea of a comprehensive Bayern card .	-5.7733
The project was further advanced by Karl Marx , the " Topographic Bureau " - and thus the Bavarian Department of Measurement .	-9.2426
The Munich Urwertsblatt dates back to 1856 and is like all the others found on the website of the Bavarian State Library .	-5.0390
The comparison used to be / Today is the most impressive example of the provincial capital .	-4.8798
The city expanded in all directions and grew together .	-2.8818
An example of this is Untersendling , which appears relatively isolated in the map of 1856 .	-3.1392
Sendling was admitted as Munich ’ s district 21 years after drawing up the map in 1877 .	-3.7138
Today , Untersendling lies in the heart of the city .	-3.1861
The Untersendlings houses are concentrated around 1856 along the present-day Plinganserstra<unk>e , which was named after Georg Sebastian Plinganser in 1878 , a leader of the Bavarian peasants against Austria in 1705 .	-5.7853
Where the West Park is today , one sees nothing but fields - at first glance : a smaller map with dozens of lines and numbers appears : hand-numbered pieces of fluids from the so-called " Urdu " , from which the base tax was derived .	-8.2557
Small plots are no longer producing farmers there - but small gärtner of the " Land in Sun " plant .	-6.9897
A large green area stands north of Subsendling .	-3.6416
The Theresienwiese , since 1810 the Oktoberfest site , was in fact still a meadow in the 19th century , not a concrete desert .	-4.1471
On the other side of the Isar , the historical map provides an insight into the history of psychiatric medicine .	-2.4317
In the main position sheet , in the area of the present-day district Au-Haidhausen , you can read not only the street name " at the Gasteig " or the hill " On the Lüften " - but also in large letters " Irken Anstalt " .	-9.2394
Yes , here on the Auerfeldstrasse people were once locked in with delusions .	-3.7587
In 1858 / 59 the Munich-Kreiss-Irsenanstalt " On the Auer Lüften " was founded .	-5.8124
In 1872 , Dr. Bernhard von Gudden led the institution - the psychiatrist who was brought to the death of King Ludwigs II .	-5.3299
" He was progressive for his time and ended , for example , the anchor of the so-called error .	-3.8171
He also forbidden the staff from using violence against the occupants , " says Hermann Wilhelm , Head of the Haidhausen Museum , who has worked for an exhibition with the institutions .	-5.2394
For 280 patients , there was first room , and later 500 seats were added .	-5.7145
Eventually , this capacity was no longer sufficient - the reason for the construction of the circular structure in hair 1905 .	-5.3335
Since 2006 , the Isa-Amper-Klinikum München-Ost , one of Germany 's largest psychiatriums , has been located there .	-4.5455
The area of the former Auer Anstalt is now a meeting place for young in Munich .	-4.1847
The Orden bought the building complex in 1920 and converted it into a youth home with training facilities .	-4.6501
West lies the football pitch of TSV München Ost , East residential houses from the 1980s .	-4.2475
In 2015 , the Casa Don Bosco Children ’ s House was built in an architectural style to reflect the origin of the Irmannanstalt , which had been destroyed in the aftermath of the bombing in World War II .	-6.9810
The Marienplatz was recorded as " Main Square " by 1856 , the Kaufingerstra<unk>e was named " Kaufinger Gasse " .	-3.9680
A major change brought World War II in the heart of Munich as well .	-3.2125
In December 1944 , the Allied bombs broke many holes into the city centre .	-4.3591
A big one remains today - at the Marienhof .	-3.5482
The English Institute , small businesses , and a medieval mine chapel once stood at the Marienhof , where the preparatory work is taking place these days , and on April 5 , 2017 the ground for the second S-bahn railway railway line .	-9.0591
With the slider you can compare the old coin card with today 's aerial photo - and fill up the holes at the Marienhof .	-5.2840
Citizens ' Rights Group publishes Travel Alert for Missouri	-2.1736
The National Association for the Promotion of Colors has issued a warning for coloured people travelling to Missouri on account of discriminatory policies and racist attacks by the state .	-4.3076
" The NAACP Travel Advisory for the State of Missouri , due to enter into force by 28 August 2017 , calls on African-American travellers , visitors and Missouri to pay special attention to travel through the state and exercise extreme caution , as a number of dubious , racist incidents in recent times occur and are recorded in the entire state , " it is said in the opinion of the group .	-7.9751
A recently adopted law by Missouri , making it harder for people to win discrimination courts , as well as the state law enforcement authorities that disproportionately target minorities , prompted the group to issue the travel warning , said NAACP .	-6.5856
" You have violations of citizens ' rights that happen to people .	-2.8928
They are stopped because of their skin colour , they are beaten or killed , " said the President of the Missouri NAACP , Rod Chapel , the Kansas City Star .	-4.2141
" We are hearing complaints in such a frequency that we have not yet heard . "	-2.9419
It is the first such warning that the organization has issued for a state in the US .	-7.4858
The group cited incidents such as racist crimes against black students at the University of Missouri and the death of Tory Sanders , 28 , a black man from Tennessee .	-2.4782
Sanders died in questionable circumstances at the beginning of the year , after he had no petrol during his journey through the state and was detained by the police of Missouri without being accused of a crime .	-5.7688
The Council also points to a recent report by the Office of the Attorney General of Missouri showing that black drivers in the state are more likely to be stopped than white .	-4.4376
" The recommendation is that people are aware and inform their families , friends and staff about what could happen in Missouri , " said Chapel .	-3.1614
" People must be willing to pay for bail or let the relatives know that they travel through the state . "	-5.6017
In 2015 , Missouri recorded 100 hate crimes , according to the latest figures from the FBI ’ s hate crime reporting program , which classifies the state to its 16th rank in terms of the number of such violations .	-5.1952
Travel warnings are also a response to a new Missouri law that would make it harder to sue a company for housing or employment discrimination .	-3.3148
Before that , the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) issued travel warnings for Texas and Arizona , following the adoption of immigration laws , which required local law enforcement agencies to arrest people for immigrant offences , which , according to the ACLU , will contribute to further racial profiling .	-5.4313
Travel warnings are usually issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs for other countries , but lately , interest groups have used the measure in response to certain laws and trends within the US .	-3.8223
Weidezaunprojekt is elementary .	-2.8265
The Fischerbach Weidezaun project is a success project and will continue next year .	-3.0405
Peter Wei<unk> and Kordula Kovac members of the Christian Democratic People ’ s Party ( Christian Democrats ) have given an image on the ground .	-6.2150
At the Graubenhof family of the Schwendemann family , representatives of the Fischerbacher CDU Association met with Mayor Thomas Schneider and the two members .	-6.8325
Markus Schwendemann first gave an insight into his farm , where he managed 55 hectares of meadows and 40 hectares of forest , supplied with 40 dairy cows and as many young animals and hosted in five apartments holiday guests .	-5.7856
For him , the " black forest milk " is the alternative way of selling the milk of his cows , says Swendemann .	-3.9537
On the table of the holiday guests there are only regional ones .	-5.1904
Since he is also chairman of the BLHV branch of Fischerbach , he called the Weidezaunprojekt " elementary important " .	-5.1697
I cannot make profitable investments in such steep areas .	-3.1196
The green area ensures a lot of work , and a lot of things have to be done with the engine sensor .	-5.1845
" We have here the conditions and fight with the topography , " said Schwendemann .	-4.6091
In 2003 he took over the parental plant and managed it without chemical plant protection and fertilizer , even if he did not run a bioplant .	-4.5004
For Mayor Thomas Schneider , it was clear : " The Commune recognized the importance of the Weidezaunprojekt and is glad about Leader Promotion " .	-5.8048
Farmers should be supported at a cost of EUR 3000 to 4000 per hectare .	-3.7113
It is hoped that it will be possible to extend the reforestation of the land for quite a while .	-5.7328
" The biggest treasure we have is the people who work in agriculture and think about how to continue their business , " stressed the Mayor .	-4.6489
Farmers are often criticised for promoting it .	-2.6274
In 2013 , a total of 25 plots were injected by eleven participants through the subsidies for grazing .	-6.0212
This leaves the area open for 40 hectares , which must not be forested by at least 2023 .	-5.4442
Half of the total costs of EUR 71 500 were increased by Leader , one quarter of which was carried by the municipality of Fischerbach .	-6.4733
This means that farmers have lost EUR 12 610 , which they had to invest in 16.2 km of wheat .	-6.9991
" The great advantage is the longevity of the fences " , explains Schwendemann .	-2.6364
Kordula Kovac stressed : " You do a really good job without farmers and rural women do not do it " .	-4.1689
Also for Peter Wei<unk> it was stated : " The best food is produced here " .	-4.3716
The Landscape Care Directive ( LPR ) Baden-Württemberg enables state support for willow fences .	-4.1469
The aim is to keep the black forest open .	-1.7708
A prerequisite is the existence of a eligibility scheme called by the LPR .	-4.3079
In addition , the area to be absorbed must not be traceable by drag ( rotation over 35 % ) and must therefore be threatened with afforestation .	-6.8372
For the Fischerbacher Weidezaunprojekt 2018 the application of eight participants with 24 plots is currently under way , who want to build just 16 km of fence .	-5.4507
The open space corresponds to 35 hectares and the costs are more than EUR 112 000 .	-4.7690
Is nothing more sacred ?	-2.0070
Now the White House of Trump is taking the Statue of Liberty	-3.2531
The safest sign of regime change is when they start to attack the statues .	-1.9785
Americans like any other – hence the carefully staged fall of Saddam Hussein ’ s Firdos Square in Baghdad in 2003 .	-4.0243
Stephen Miller , one of the key ideologues of the Trump regime , surely knew what he did when he took a symbolic axe in a heated dispute with Jim Acosta from CNN about the president ’ s proposals to drastically restrict legal immigration with the Statue of Liberty .	-3.8538
To remain fair , Miller did not attack the statue itself .	-1.9067
A horde of boatowners and liberty-imitators would have yelled him if he had done so .	-3.5848
But he grasped its importance , and especially the importance that was attributed to her when the famous poem by Emma Lazarus was added to his base in 1903 , 17 years after the completion of the monument .	-4.2865
As Miller Acosta complained : " I don 't want to go into a complete thing about history , but the Statue of Liberty is ... a symbol of American freedom that the world is learning .	-5.0499
The poem you refer to , which was later added and is not part of the original Statue of Liberty . '	-4.1514
Miller is right , but as he himself put it , it is not really about history .	-2.7459
It is about the contemporary response to the stirring words of Lazarus , the only one in which a state not only invites any old immigrants , but the poorest of the poor : " Your mothers , your poor , / your embattled masses , who yearn to breathe freely , / the miserable waste of your coasts . "	-6.6774
There was never a time when the " wretched waste " on our screens was better viewed .	-4.1868
Miller was not engaged in literary criticism – he made it clear that these people are not welcome in Trump ’ s US .	-2.9890
This conflict because of the importance of a statue is part of a broader political and cultural dispute : it is indeed a conflict over the importance of America .	-4.0202
Lazarus - and their friends who worked to place their words on the ground after their death - knew very well that they had a highly political act .	-3.9232
The sculpture should show the links between French and American Republicalism by depicting the female embodiment of freedom in a used classical image .	-4.8646
Lazarus changed this meaning : In her poem , the female figure is no longer abstract - she has received a voice .	-2.8620
And she gives herself a very different name : Mother of the Exile .	-2.6615
The combination of the poem with the image is a brilliant feminist coup and a devastating attack on American nativism .	-2.5559
And just as Lazarus changed the meaning of the statue , people from the right wing wanted to change it a long time ago .	-3.2730
The great cry , Rush Limbaugh , a kind of John the Baptist , for the coming of Trump , argued in 2010 that the Statue of Liberty is not welcoming anyone , but rather an early neo-conservative who brings the American flame to the surrounding world : " Lady Liberty is moving .	-6.3698
It should carry the torch of freedom from the United States to the rest of the world .	-2.0340
The torch should not seek the path to the United States . '	-3.3072
It was rather unusual that Limbaugh came up against something .	-4.9799
The significance of the statue is quite a question of the position of perception .	-2.7635
The great imaginative fact of Lazarus was to see them as seen by the exhausted , miserable but hopeful people after long and often terrible journeys on the decks of ships .	-4.4822
It really is about seeing the world from the perspective of people who seek refuge and an opportunity to improve their lives .	-3.2148
Their statue speaks to them the words of hope and the will they have to hear .	-2.7984
And that , of course , is not the perspective that Miller and Trump ever want to recognize .	-2.8825
Their torch is not meant to follow the path , but to ignite hatred , which is their only source of power .	-4.4178
World Cup 2017 : Neil Black lobes Scottish members of the British team	-2.8618
Eilidh Doyle remembers a time when only two Scots were part of the British team .	-2.5462
The performance director of the United Kingdom ’ s athletics , Neil Black , says that the 16-headed Scottish contingent in the World Cup will ' make a massive contribution to the team ' .	-4.1710
A record number of Scottish athletes was selected for London 2017 , which starts on Friday .	-1.7728
Black believes that ' developing something special in Scotland ' and that the UK 's athletics must learn something from it .	-4.7390
" We welcome it , and we try to understand it , and we will continue to do it until we find out , " said Black .	-2.6544
" I speak to people in the Scottish Institute of Sport and they think that it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.5855
Scottish athletes think it has something to do with what they have done .	-2.3621
British athletics : It has something to do with what they have done .	-1.6813
And also with the type on the street corner .	-2.6163
Whatever the combination of circumstances , it is absolutely brilliant . '	-1.7157
Several of the Scottish athletes are medal contenders , including Laura Muir and Andrew Butchart - who will compete against Sir Mo Farah on the 5,000 m route , while Eilidh Doyle was chosen by the team as captain .	-5.5200
" Eilidh is fairly modest .	-1.9803
Her speech in chapter was incredible , " says Black .	-4.1552
" A number of athletes , regardless of whether they were Scottish or where they live or train , went out of the room and felt very proud and highly motivated .	-4.5598
The passion and the real feeling Eilidh brought up quite naturally was great . '	-4.3540
The Commonwealth silver medallinger who will compete on the 400m hurdles in her fifth World Cup says that it is " incredible " that 16 Scots are in the British team .	-5.4393
Scotland ’ s best total number of athletes at the World Cup was seven , which was achieved in 1983 and 2015 .	-3.9299
Mr Muir is on this road and has set five British and two European records last year .	-5.5030
It will participate in the 1,500 m and the 5,000 m run .	-2.1986
Chris O 'Hare , who runs 1500 metres , is another Scot to watch after a great season , which included the victory of the British Team Trials and the Anniversary Games .	-5.3099
Doyle remembers her first world championships when the only other Scot was in Team Lee McConnell .	-3.7531
The team ’ s papers say that they are “ extremely proud ” of the fact that many of their fellow countrymen will not only be part of the team , but in some cases also participate in medals and finals .	-6.7960
" The special thing about being a team skipper is that she was elected by the other members of the team , so it was a great honor anyway , but to know that my team colleagues voted for me and elected me , makes it a very special for me , " she added .	-6.5267
" Obviously I am very proud of all the Scots belonging to the team .	-1.7394
It only shows how far we have come .	-1.4060
And they are here as established athletes , athletes who want to climb on podium .	-5.0395
As far as my speech as a chapter is concerned ?	-3.1449
Yes , I think it went well .	-1.2013
I just pointed out that we are very happy in this situation because we have a home world championship .	-3.5520
So it is really important to rely on this home support and to take advantage of the fact that we are back in the Olympic .	-3.9191
I get a second chance to go out and compete there and it will simply be such a great atmosphere out there ' .	-3.1451
Blocking critters on Facebook : Don ’ t worry about public office if you cannot stand up to voters .	-6.8782
Our country ’ s father knew something of bad press .	-1.9980
The Americans loved George Washington , but it did not take long for newspapers to beat him for everything , from domestic politics to its political principles .	-3.0309
He answered the criticism , certainly .	-3.9569
But he has not silenced his critics .	-1.0239
For in 1783 , Washington said : ' Free speech can be taken away - and , stupid and dumb , we are being brought to slaughter like sheep ' .	-5.2943
This brings me to Maryland , Governor Larry Hogan , who must work to be more like Washington .	-2.3394
Hogans employees have blocked and deleted the contributions of at least 450 people who expressed their opinion on their official Facebook page .	-3.4546
And the American Civil Liberties Union sued him at the beginning of this week .	-2.2389
The governor 's staff dismissed the complaint as frivol , and the online comment was full of a backlash with " Na , and ? " .	-2.1879
" It is just Facebook , " said many people .	-1.8197
But it is important .	-0.8815
And it is especially important if it is a type like hoogan .	-3.5666
This is a Republican governor in an overwhelmingly democratic state , surprisingly popular .	-2.1167
He has the second highest approval of the nation 's 50 governors .	-2.3013
Hogan is not a reactionary heat head .	-1.7442
He has shown a firm hand in guiding his state and adhering strictly to the principles .	-3.1709
He was also very skilful in using Facebook as a primary means of connecting with his voters and playing his hapless head to chemotherapy on his side .	-4.3960
Therefore , blocking people who come on the side of the Governor - who is a public forum called officially and paid for with public tax dollars - is unnecessary and ultimately dangerous .	-5.9166
In an interview with The Washington Post , Hogans Speaker Amelia Chasse defended the actions of the governor and argued that blocking the comments was nothing more than moderating .	-3.6507
But it is too easy to use the image of trolls or spammers or hackle people who are gaping the stick online .	-4.8684
The post spoke to some of the real people who were blocked by Hogan .	-2.1285
And these are only real people who talk to their elected leaders : a teacher , an entrepreneur , and a priest , no trolls .	-3.4626
They all said that their comments were respectful , thoughtful , and not professional .	-2.1994
The priest quoted the Bible in his post and appealed to Hogans Catholic faith .	-2.1822
Lawyers Lakshmi Sarma Ramani of Bowie , Md , was not hastily filled , but she asked about hate crimes .	-3.3351
" I commented politely that I was disappointed that there was no reaction to hate crimes and other current news , " wrote it in the commentary section of the news program " The Post " .	-4.0524
" Nor do I value this idea if a number of people take a stand on the same subject , then some people regard it as a so-called collective effort and do not recognise it as a large group of citizens concerned .	-10.8570
What the governor ’ s employees called a “ concentrated spam attack , ” others would probably call “ the talk . ”	-5.4056
The Facebook era makes it easy to cut a message by simply blocking a critic or removing a negative comment .	-2.4510
It is much cleaner than in previous times if you had done the same thing that people were sent to collect and burn newspapers with critical articles , or to arrest and silence demonstrators .	-5.1519
But that is exactly what is happening digitally .	-2.4510
Hogan is not the first public official to be criticized for insulting Facebook and other social media .	-2.5334
President Trump is sued by Twitter users blocked by his Twitter feed .	-1.4775
One of the first milestones on this issue came last week in Virginia .	-1.9921
The chairman of the Loudoun County Board of Supervisors wounded the First Amendment , according to US Secretary of State James C. Cacheris in Alexandria , when she expelled a voter from her Facebook page .	-4.7076
And in Kentucky , Governor Matt Bevin ( R ) also received a visit from the ACLU for his use of Facebook and Twitter .	-2.2518
This should not be so difficult .	-1.8318
At the time , Washington ’ s time of affordable postage had a similar effect to the Internet .	-4.1047
The number of newspapers multiplied between 1776 and 1800 , and anonymous letters suggested his leadership .	-3.0959
And even then , Washington had anonymous trolls .	-1.0092
The people who used pseudonyms such as ' Juricola ' , ' Valerius ' , ' Belisarius ' and ' Portius ' wrote all letters to newspapers that brought down Washington 's decisions .	-3.9158
Petitions , who criticized his position on the Amity , Trade , and shipping agreement with Britain , overruled his office , according to the historical documents collected by the George Washington Project 's Online Papers .	-4.9447
But he has not silenced them .	-1.6529
Freedom of speech , difference of opinion and discourses belong to the basis of our nation .	-2.5442
And true leadership means accepting it .	-1.9401
Ronan Raffarty hopes for home comfort at the Renaissance Club	-2.9370

Gary Orr , who joined the European Senior Tour earlier this year after his 50th birthday , returns to the action on his home floor .	-4.2704
This event will be his first Scottish appearance since the Aberdeen Asset Management Scottish Open in 2013 .	-1.6303
" It always means a bit more when you play at home , " said Orr , the man from Helensburgh .	-3.7714
" You want to make it good , but you feel also this extra pressure .	-2.8011
I really enjoyed playing again and I played a solid golf .	-2.2044
I am glad about what has happened ' .	-3.5553
He also played a key role in the NBA .	-11.9727

Less lung cancer killed by passive smoking	-1.8720
In the last two decades , fewer and fewer people have died of lung cancer due to passive smoking .	-2.2337
Scientists at the University Hospital of Hamburg-Eppendorf ( UKE ) are coming to this conclusion in a study .	-4.5458
" According to our estimates , 167 lung cancer cases are caused by passive smoking each year , " said Professor Heiko Becher .	-3.7006
As a comparison , he presented his own study on the subject of 1994 .	-4.4610
Back then , there were 400 lung cancer cases in Germany because of passive smoking a year .	-3.4993
The new study is published in the International Journal of Public Health .	-2.1319
Domestic communications prove to be very complex	-3.6350
The construction works in the Villinger Stra<unk>e are in full swing and " lie some time " , according to the head of the Fred Heinze building station .	-5.6266
In the area of home connections , the situation is more complicated than expected , as much remains underground , which is not included in the plans .	-5.6426
The transport , which always obstructs construction work , is a major problem for the Stumpp construction team .	-5.0772

In her wooden house in Enarotali , the capital of the Paniai rule in the quiet Indonesian province of Papua , the housewife usually puts a candy potato - known as " nota " locally - directly into the fireplace .	-6.0642

It is a rare insight into daily life in the highlands of Papua , a former Dutch colony , which was admitted in Indonesia in 1969 after a disputed referendum , when only 1,026 elders should vote in front of the occupying forces by public handlift .	-5.7615
An existing movement promoting independence against Dutch rule quickly turned against the Jakarta government , which controls the region and excludes foreign journalists or judicial observers .	-4.5738
In 2003 , the province was officially divided into Papua and West Papua , with the independent Papua New Guinea representing the eastern part of the island .	-3.6015

Papua is Indonesia ’ s poorest province , with 28 % of people living below the poverty line and some of the worst child mortality and literacy rates in Asia .	-2.8672
But it is also Indonesia ’ s Goldland .	-2.5084
The largest and most profitable gold mine in the world , Grasberg , owned by the Phoenix Freeport McMoran , is located only 60 miles from Paniai , a high landmine in the size of New Jersey with 153,000 inhabitants .	-4.6393
In 2015 alone , Freeport reduced US $ 3.1 billion in gold and copper .	-1.7675
Papua also holds an estimated $ 78 billion in timber resources .	-2.5880
This wealth , however , is a source of misery for the Papua , ensuring that Indonesia ’ s powerful military retains a suffocating presence .	-4.0613
A 2005 study in the New York Times reported that Freeport paid almost $ 20 million to local military personnel and units between 1998 and 2004 , including up to $ 150,000 to a single officer .	-3.6404

The Indonesian President Joko Widodo , known as Jokowi , promised to address inequalities and violations in Papua during his campaign in 2014 .	-3.2855
The former carman secured 27 of the 29 districts of Papua - including Paniai - on the way to the presidential palace in Jakarta .	-3.4310
But little has changed in Papua , and today the locals feel betrayed .	-2.8788
" Our hearts have broken because we voted in favour of Jokowi in 2014 , with the expectation that he will meet our hopes that justice will be restored , " says You .	-3.4317

On December 7 , 2014 , a group of 11 children were out and sang Christmas songs off a fire in Enarotali , when two Indonesian soldiers broke through the darkness on a bike .	-4.9233
The rocked children told them they should turn their headlights on .	-3.0665
One of the soldiers took offence at their clay and came back with four soldiers , according to the local pastor Yawdt Tebai .	-5.1878
The soldiers who had drunk hunted and beat the party with their tissue collages , said victims and witnesses .	-4.0575
Then one of the soldiers fired into the group of children .	-1.4280
A child , 16-year-old Yulianus Yeimo , was hit so hard that he fell into coma .	-3.1207
A few hours later , the building of the nearby government commission was set fire and things escalated the next day .	-3.2362
About 1,000 young Papua men , women , and children gathered at a football pitch in front of the local police station and the military command center to demand justice .	-3.5706
They wept ceremonial hunting bows and led the Waita dance - continuously and imitating a bird singing - from Papua Mee Pago stamm .	-8.8906
Some demonstrators began to drag stones on police and military posts .	-2.2094
When the mood was heated , a command was sent to the soldiers about an internal spark : " If the masses resist more than three times , they shoot them dead , " it is said in an official document of TIME , which was not released to the local media .	-4.7794
Yeremias Kayame , 56 , head of the Kego Koto-Quarter of Enarotali , saw the imminent danger and called for rest and demanded the crowd to return home .	-4.7759
Nobody was in the mood to listen .	-1.5647
" When I turned around , I was shot into my left wrist , " he said TIME on the veranda of his colorful wooden house .	-3.6616
Kayame still does not know who fired , but says that the ball came from the ranks of the soldiers gathered here .	-3.6371
" It was overcrowded , many shots were fired , " he adds .	-2.4256
The indigenous man Alfius Youw was met three times , so his cousin , who witnessed the shooting .	-3.7659
" I ran to him and studied his body to make sure he was , " said Yohanes , who , like many Indonesian , bears only one name , the TIME in dark atmosphere .	-4.1756
" I saw that he was dead ... I hated him . "	-2.4904
The chief inspector of the Papua police , Yotje Mende , told reporters that his officers simply wanted to " secure " their station because they were attacked .	-4.0579
" We must defend ourselves when people threaten to kill us , " said the spokesman of the Papua Police , Commissioner Pudjo Sulistiyo , in 2015 .	-2.9252
'It is about life and death ' .	-1.6388
According to Human Rights Watch , five young protesters were killed and many others injured .	-5.0101
The news of the killings came to Jakarta only the following day ' filtered ' .	-6.1327
Three weeks later , Jokowi made a passionate speech in Jayapura , expressing sympathy for the victims ' families and voicing to address the historical ills of Papua .	-4.6552
" I want this case to be resolved immediately , so it will not happen again in the future , " he said .	-2.8031
Security Secretary Wiranto said in October 2016 that he established an extrajudicial mechanism for settling historical human rights violations .	-3.2186
But the excuses began almost immediately .	-1.1151
" Most injuries occurred a long time ago .	-1.5732
Some were in the nineties and the beginning of the 2000 's . the were , , etc . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-6.6425
The point is that we have undertaken to address these infringements , but there are processes that need to go through , " he said .	-3.5260
Then Wiranto made a withdrawal when he spoke to TIME in Jakarta on June 5 , and said he had no plans to set up a complain-mechanism in Papua .	-3.6965
Instead , ' everything is regulated by law ' , he said .	-2.0115
Wiranto , who indicted the UN for ' crimes against humanity ' , which claimed more than 1,000 deaths in East Timor 's bloody vote of independence in 1999 , said that 11 cases of human rights violations in Papua have already been resolved , including the Paniai case .	-4.2208
Paniai victims ’ families made such claims with fierce disbelief .	-3.8214
" I have been interviewed four times over the last three years , but there has been no progress , " says Yohanes .	-2.5883
'I am tired ' .	-1.1227
He says that years later he still lives in fear .	-2.0267
" I am afraid , " he says .	-1.6288
" I fear being arrested by the military , fear being shot . "	-2.3707
His brother Yacobus repeated the view that people in Paniai are afraid to discuss the incident .	-2.7024
He says that he was beaten by the military after helping to bury four of the victims .	-2.2832
" After I had buried the corpses , the military looked for me , " he says .	-4.2071
The shooting had not stopped .	-2.3872
On Tuesday , the Indonesian police shot villagers in Paniai 's neighborhood Deiyai .	-2.8642
During a confrontation between village dwellers and the manager of a construction company that refused to bring a conscious man to hospital , one person and 17 others were injured , including children .	-2.8002
The man , 24-year-old Ravianus Douw , who drowned when he fished in a nearby river , died on the way to the hospital .	-3.1035
Received villagers protested in front of the company ’ s location office .	-8.5343
The police said that the villagers threw stones on officers who responded by firing warning shots .	-2.8415
But natives say that the mobile brigade ( Indonesian paramilitary police ) started to shoot at the crowd and killed one .	-3.4248
" We were in panic , we were afraid that there will be revenge , " says the 29-year-old Dominggu Badii , who was living near the hospital and witness how the injured were quickly admitted here , so the TIME .	-6.0376
" I have hidden me two days in my house . "	-3.6736
The Deiyai department has called for the officers involved to be accountable and to withdraw the mobile police brigade from the area .	-3.2982
Paniai has always been a troublemaker for the Indonesian government .	-4.7099
The lack of meaningful development reinforces the discontent of the tribal chiefs , Moni , Dani , and Damal living in the green highlands of Papua .	-4.1673
Many joined the " Free Papua Movement " ( OPM ) , the rebel army claiming to defend the rights of Papua by inciting sporadic attacks and kidnappings of Indonesian soldiers .	-3.5164
Some of the top OPM leaders are from Paniai , including Tadius Yogi and Daniel Yudas Kogoya .	-2.7869
In response to this , thousands of people in Paniai have been arrested and arbitrarily arrested in recent years , on the pretext of ' safeguarding national sovereignty ' .	-3.6143
Some never dive again .	-2.7365
Among the people of Papua , Paniai is known as " a tragic , forgotten place " .	-3.7300
Poverty reinforces discontent .	-1.4274
The little rice sold in Enarotali is too expensive for locals .	-3.2901
Bread is just as beyond reach .	-2.9506
People here are building everything they eat : Nota , fruit and leaf vegetables .	-3.5224
Agriculture is the job of women who can each process four or five sweet potato fields .	-4.4926
They keep most of the family 's harvest while the rest is sold on the local market .	-2.7842
Ten pieces Nota cost only 10,000 Indonesian rupees ( 75 cents ) .	-1.8483
Over time , economic inequalities have grown between the indigenous Papua and the new migrants , which have been increasing since the opening of new flight routes to Nagore airport .	-5.4314
The few jobs in the region typically go to better-educated and wealthier migrants .	-2.8608
Papua rarely have the capital or the skills needed to compete their own companies .	-2.5486
" Young people are not interested in staying in the village ... because there are no jobs or money " , says John Gobai , Chairman of the board of Paniai .	-3.5906
Inisolation keeps the eyes of the world away from Papua .	-1.7257
Moreover , restrictions on reporting remain confined to international media .	-5.2234
At the beginning of the year , French journalists Franck Escudie and Basille Longchamp were deported for lack of coordination with related institutions from Papua , even though they were given the rare permission to film .	-4.2317
According to Phelim Kine , the Deputy Director of Human Rights Watch , the promises made by Jokowi ’ s campaign to lift the restrictions on reporting to promote transparency and development have not been realized .	-3.5069
" There are new dangers for foreign journalists trying to report to Indonesia 's most troubled eastern provinces of Papua and Westpapua : visa refusal and a blacklist , " he said in a statement .	-3.9064
Shorting press control means that international pressure on the Indonesian Government remains largely confined to Papua 's immediate neighbours .	-2.8648
In March , six Pacific States - Tonga , Nauru , Palau , Tuvalu , the MarshallIslands and the Solomon Islands - called on the UN Human Rights Council to investigate the " various and widespread infringements " in Papua , including the Paniai raion .	-5.3153
The same countries have historically supported OPM .	-1.2757
The spokesman for the Indonesian Foreign Ministry Arrmanatha Nasir rejected the group 's allegations and said journalists in Jakarta : ' In Indonesia there is still a democratic system and there is free media , so it is difficult to conceal evidence of human rights cases ' .	-5.5726
The local people want more foreign governments to take note of this .	-1.9289
As an official delegation from the Netherlands , under the leadership of the human rights Ambassador Kees Van Baar , Jayapura visited on 4 May , locals broke their silence and pressed him " We want freedom " , according to a source that also took part in the session , but wants to remain anonymous .	-5.1142
Indonesia has another presidential election in 2019 , but the Papua say that they will probably not vote for Jokowi again .	-2.6093
" Jokowi is a man who has good intentions , but he is surrounded by the people who are involved in the Paniai shots , " says Gobai , the chairman of the board .	-5.5931
He wants Jokowi to know that the Paniai people , apart from living under the constant threat of a predatory military , are in poor educational and health services .	-3.2733
Gobai says that the Paniai people , like other Papua , consider their vote for Jokowi as a " debt " that he must pay back .	-4.4940
" They do not need money , they just want justice , " he says .	-2.3648
Despite threats and intimidations , the Paniai victims ’ families carried out a last symbolic act of comfort : the body of a victim was buried on a site exactly opposite the police and the military station .	-5.4186
They know that they may never have justice , but at least let those responsible forget their crimes .	-3.1602
" A member of our family was killed , " says Yacobus with lowered head .	-3.0828

For the second time , fires capture Dubai ’ s “ Torch ” cloud owner .	-4.7099
One fire found its register in one of the world ’ s highest residential towers in Dubai on Friday , forcing hundreds of residents to flee from the 337 metres high 79-storey building .	-5.2233
It is the second brand that , in just two years , feeds through the high house , which is randomly called the Torch-Tower ( torch-tower ) .	-5.5263
The building was evacuated , injuries were not reported and there was no direct word about the cause of the flame .	-2.0960
" We slept and we stood up at the fire alarm and shouting of people .	-3.7442
We ran down the stairs , and it took about 10 minutes to get down from the 50th floor , " a resident who started his name as George angab , Reuters .	-5.0065
Dubais civil protection authorities said that fire-fighting units at 4 p.m. local time ( 00am GMT ) extinguished the fire and cooled the building .	-5.0650
The government said they are working on providing shelter for those affected .	-2.5597
The incident can revive questions about the safety of materials used in exterior areas of high-rise buildings around the world .	-4.1024
An investigation by the management of the Torch building following its fire in 2015 revealed that most of the damage came from the coating , the external coating to the decoration or insulation .	-5.4405
In Britain , the police said that they believe that the system of plates for insulation and coating on the Grenfell Tower in June could have contributed to the rapid spread of a fire in which about 80 people died .	-4.9059
No Davis-Cup reform : Continue Best-of-five	-3.4717
The president of the International Tennis Association ( ITF ) went through at the General Assembly with his large Davis Cup Coup .	-4.4836
At the meeting in Ho-Chi-Minh City , the revolutionary proposal for this sport to play Davis-Cup-individual only on two profit rates was not superficially supported by the required two-thirds majority .	-6.2465
Although the five-cat classic , which is often very long , but also very much appreciated for this reason , is still in keeping with the traditional contest .	-8.2637
65,54 % of the Member States voted in favour of reform , so the target of ITF President David Hagnisty was barely missed .	-5.9772
" We respect this decision , but we are disappointed that our member nations did not adopt the entire Davis Cup and Fed Cup reform package .	-2.5771
We need a change to secure the long-term future of these iconic and historic contests , " said Haggene .	-4.1413
We will continue to work on improving the application .	-3.0689
After many objections , it was not until the vote that the final was presented in a neutral place .	-5.8208
Little details are new from 2018 : In future , the finalists at the Davis Cup and Fed Cup will have the host right in the first round .	-4.4425
In order to reduce the costs for the event organisers , the training place requirements will be made easier and players will have to complete less official media appointments before the Davis Cup .	-6.5180
More than 1 out of 5 US travellers bring prohibited items to the plane , find a survey .	-3.3242
A survey among airline passengers found that more than 20 percent deliberately or unconsciously prohibited items smuggled past US Transportation Security Administration control points , including at least 6 % of the aircraft , while accidentally carrying prohibited blades or other items .	-5.8863
Less than 1 % claimed that they were late to discover that they were mistakenly guns , ammunition , or explosives .	-3.7182
The survey among more than 1,000 people - carried out by a jet charter service , the Stratos Jet Charters Inc . - also found that younger travellers tend to disregard the rules .	-4.6054
Of the respondents who admitted that they were knowingly trying to fly with something prohibited by TSA , 19.7 % Millennials compared to less than 15 % who were members of generation X .	-5.3778
The most common objects that were deliberately passed by TSA agents were foodstuffs and liquids .	-4.4012
More than 3 % said that they had carried objects with blades through security control , while 2.2 % of female respondents and 3.7 % of male respondents also confirmed that they had deliberately brought prohibited drugs into the plane .	-6.2493
The company said that it interviewed travellers throughout the country to find out how many accidentally smuggled goods through airport security and how many deliberately they had done .	-5.9497
It is no surprise that those who wear the most smuggled goods - knowingly or unknowingly - by safety were those who fly most .	-4.2091
However , the company points out that the TSA guidelines are somewhat complicated and confusing .	-2.6716
People are often unsure about what liquids they can take with them or how much of them .	-4.0492
So it is no surprise that the largest amount of liquids prohibited by TSA is .	-4.0408
For a while , people thought that TSA could view books as smugglers .	-3.1250
Liquids are allowed on domestic flights , but not on international flights .	-1.8192
Elon Musk doesn ’ t care : tens of thousands of Tesla customers cancel Order .	-2.9347
Electro-thousandsaga Elon Musk is happy to give with the huge number of reservations for his new Tesla " Model 3 " .	-4.5174
In so far he has signed up to now that some of the customers have already withdrawn their no-obligation reservations .	-5.8223
In addition to the ever triumphant figures on sales increases and even more massive sales targets , Tesla-CEO Elon Musk announced a different , less brilliant figure for the first time : the cancellation of the new mass market model 3 .	-6.3057
Over the past few months Musk had often applied for the new car with more than 500,000 reservations , whose delivery is just beginning .	-6.6653
Musk is now concealing : of the 518 000 reservations , 63,000 have already been withdrawn .	-4.8184
Critics have repeatedly pointed out that these are merely non-binding reservations .	-2.7392
In case of cancellation , Tesla will pay the 1,000 euro ( US $ 1,000 and <unk> 1,000 in the UK ) " Reservation in full back " . will be to . will will will . will will will will . will	-11.2449
Currently 455,000 such no-obligation reservations are available , and Musk will present a telephone conference with analysts .	-5.5079
However , Tesla 's boss does not believe that cancelling up to now approximately 12 percent of all orders could be a problem .	-4.7622
Its argument is that the challenge of ambitious growth targets is not demand but production .	-3.5118
Last year Tesla delivered 84,000 vehicles .	-1.1910
2018 - all models taken together - is supposed to be 500,000 , 2020 a million .	-3.4790
The demand for this is obvious .	-3.0770
According to Musk , 1,800 reservations are currently available per day .	-3.1022
In the second half of 2018 , if Tesla manages to drive its brand new production lines , which have never been tested in practice , without major interruptions at maximum utilisation .	-5.6741
Many experts doubt that this is possible .	-1.4340
However , if there are any major delays , the non-binding nature of the reservation could become a problem for Tesla .	-5.9866
After all , the company cannot prevent unsatisfied customers from running away in droves .	-4.1983
EPO Chairman Pruitt is withdrawing from the Obama Era rules to reduce emissions because of the delay in the Obama Era rules .	-5.8087
One day after he was sued by 15 states , Scott Pruitt , the head of the Environmental Protection Agency , withdrew his earlier decision to delay implementation of the Obama era rules to reduce emissions of fuel-induced air pollution .	-4.3507
Pruitt presented the change when its agency proved more responsive to the needs of state environmental authorities than previous administrations .	-3.5533
He did not mention the case that had been filed against his previous post in a Federal Employment Court .	-3.7744
It is a deadline for states to meet 2015 standards for ground-level ozone on 1 October .	-3.9340
Pruitt announced in June that he would delay compliance by one year to give his authority more time , study the plan , and avoid " intervening in local decisions or impeding economic growth " .	-3.6981
Pruitt , who was appointed by President Donald Trump Public Prosecutor of Oklahoma , has long been a reliable opponent of stricter environmental legislation .	-3.3715
Since his arrival in Washington , Pruitt has repeatedly managed to block or delay regulations that the chemical industry and fossil-fuel industry oppose .	-3.5244
The sudden reversal of Wednesday is the latest legal setback for the Pruitt 's regulatory rollback agenda .	-4.1780
Last month , a Federal Employment Court in Washington decided that the EPO administrator had exceeded his authority when he tried to delay the implementation of a rule of the Obama administration requiring oil and gas companies to monitor and reduce methane leaks .	-4.9906
In an opinion published on Wednesday evening , Pruitt proposed that its U-turn in ozone standards simply reinforce the EPO 's willingness to cooperate with the states through the complex process of timely fulfilment of the new standards .	-6.7738
" Under former administrations , CEPOL has often failed to meet the deadlines for implementation and then waited to be indicted by activist groups and others , and in an agreement to set the date for implementation , " Pruitt said , who sued the EPA more than a dozen times in his previous job .	-6.4948
" We do not believe in regulation through litigation and we take time limits seriously .	-2.1191
We also take the law and the authority that exists . '	-2.3505
Nevertheless , the opinion of the EPO stated that Pruitt will at some point use its ' late authority and all other legally available powers ' to ensure that the rules are ' based on a sound policy and the best available information ' .	-5.2008
Congressional Republicans are pushing for a more comprehensive reconversion of the ozone rules .	-3.3757
A bill approved last month is intended to delay the implementation of the 2015 rules by at least eight years .	-2.1827
The measure has not yet been put to the vote in the Senate .	-1.8960
The New York Attorney General Eric Schneider , who led the coalition of states that had sued the EPO this week , said that the group intends to maintain legal pressure .	-3.6418
" The reversal of EPAs - after our complaints - is an important gain for health and safety from these 6,7 million New Yorkers and over 115 million Americans directly affected by the smog that flows into their communities , " said Schneider .	-5.5223
New York joined California , Connecticut , Delaware , Illinois , Iowa , Maine , Massachusetts , Minnesota , New Mexico , Oregon , Pennsylvania , Rhode Island , Vermont and Washington , and the District of Columbia .	-1.7328
Soil-ozone arises when pollutants from cars , power plants , oil refineries , chemical plants and other sources react to sunlight in the atmosphere .	-3.2717
The resulting smog can cause serious respiratory problems in sensitive groups of people , and every year contribute to thousands of premature deaths .	-3.1812
Public health officials and environmentalists cheered for a surprising change of course .	-3.5259
" It is worrying how much pressure it takes to get this sensible step from the responsible for protecting the air we breathe in , " said Lori Ann Burd of the Center for Biological Diversity .	-3.7223
" We must continue to fight against the Trump administration 's ideological crusade to pander to polluters and their special interests . "	-3.2036

In 1267 , the St. Hilariuskapelle was first mentioned in the history of Württemberg : Count Hermann of Sulz sold the mountain with the parish church on Tumbling and the Vogtei " at Magister Eberhard von Horb and his brother Dietrich for 20 DM .	-6.2630
The text of the document was based on the Tumminger mountain , apart from the former parish church , a stately court of which the church or the right of patronage belonged and not the other way around .	-7.5139
So people lived there too .	-2.6726
As is evident from the description of the City of Freudes in 1858 , next to the Lower village and the Oberdorf , which are still to be seen today in the townscape of Tummingen , the " mountain " of the third , the village 's stately settlement center .	-9.0830
Old maps dating back to the year 1600 reinforce these historical facts .	-4.4242
The right of patronage was created from the early medieval right of self-church .	-8.8086
A Lord who built a church , endowed and filled with a priest , remained the owners of this church and could inherit this church .	-6.0885
This was the right to appoint a priest or to propose to the bishop a new priest .	-3.7549
There were three altars in the church and two bells in the tower .	-2.2309
The greater the two crumble at Christmas 1673 .	-2.9390
The newly created bell reigns in 1692 , but had to be released later in the Second World War in 1942 .	-8.0342
In the Thirty Years War ( 1616 to 1648 ) , the window panes were dropped and the bell ropes were stolen .	-4.8272
The room was clean and comfortable .	-5.4904
In 1796 , French troops were stationed near the church .	-3.1272
They break out the chancellor and church chairs and used them as firewood .	-2.7787
The remains of the church threatened to collapse in 1809 .	-4.4441
In 1869 , the Tumminger Hilarius-Fried also served as the last resting place for the deaths from radio swiss .	-6.4966
In 1823 the cemetery was extended and the Hilariuskirche abrogated .	-3.2702
It was very noisy at night .	-6.1642
In the New Year 's Eve in 1834 , a storm broke the church tower and half crashed .	-3.0049
In order to prevent an accident , the tower was broken .	-3.3714
Only the castle , which is still in existence today , has been preserved as a witness to the 750 years of church history .	-5.6642
Today , Horst Kallenberger and Rolf-Dieter Wasem care for the Hilarius-Annex by the " Schaffener Pensionen " as the successor of Dieter Dockhorn .	-5.8356
As organizers , the friends and promoters Tumbling invite the sixth Serenade to the old cemetery at St. Hilariuskapelle on Sunday , July 16 .	-4.7414
These are designed by the combo of the Kepler gymnasium Freudenstadt and with contributions from Kurt Kübler and Reinhold Matteis .	-3.5776
The words of Chief Local Hartmut Romann speak .	-4.4983
The program starts at 4.30 p.m.	-2.1281
Entry is from 3.30 p.m.	-4.0837

The Serenade takes place only in dry weather .	-2.6124
The organizers hope for many supporters to receive the historic St. Hilarius plant , which is important for tumours and horticulture .	-6.0596
Friends and guardians of Tumbling feel particularly committed to home care , as pointed out by Serenade Organiser Walter Martini .	-5.1192
Association wants to have wind-wheel approval verified	-4.9174
" Boisheim " does not see any legal requirement for construction and has therefore addressed the Landrat .	-5.4469
The Boisheim Association asked Landrat Andreas Coenen ( CDU ) to withdraw its approval for the construction of planned wind turbines in the Boisheim Park .	-4.6654
It should be unlawful .	-2.4502
The club argues that , at the time of its approval on 30 December 2016 , no wind power plants could have been approved in the Boisheim Corte , since at the time in Viersen only a wind-power center zone existed at the city limits of Schwalmtal . the of the .	-8.1381
Within this concentration zone , the construction and operation of wind power plants are possible , but at the same time the concentration zone does not affect the use of wind energy for the rest of the city .	-9.6479
These zones should prevent the landscape from being " sealed " .	-3.5788
Although the town of Viersen had decided a second wind concentrate zone in the Boisheim Nette , a few days earlier , by changing the land use plan - but the district government of Düsseldorf had not approved it because of a mistake .	-10.6860
" Due to the lack of a planning requirement , the approved certificate is still illegal and therefore also withdrawn , " said Christoph Erkens , chairman of " Boisheim is defending " .	-6.0184
Current state of affairs : the city council decided again the Windconcentrate zone in the Boisheim Nette before the summer break ; the district government 's approval is still pending .	-7.3095
Erkens : " This excludes the granting of permission for the construction of wind power plants " .	-4.9428
The circle confirms the receipt of the invitation .	-1.3308
" The corresponding letters were received by Viersen since last week " , a speaker explained .	-4.1186
The circle takes it as an opportunity to re-examine the matter .	-6.8403
They are not likely to result in the process being stopped .	-3.1773
With a view to ongoing proceedings at the administrative court , the group of Thursday did not want to comment on the arguments of the association " Boisheim is defending " .	-6.1755
The NEW Re , a subsidiary of the NEW , plans to build four hundred meters of wind wheels on an area on the Boisheim Corte .	-6.2262
The company in which the city of Viersen is directly involved had already signed lease contracts with the owner of about 65 hectares .	-5.3272
The four wind power plants are designed to meet the electricity requirements of around 11 400 households , which corresponds to about one fifth of the electricity requirements of all four households .	-5.9323
The NEW Re wants to invest around EUR 20 million .	-2.9530
Last summer , Viersens City Council gave the green light to buy three wind farms at the Linnich wind farm in Aachen and to participate in a wind farm in <unk>bach-Palenberg in the county of Heinsberg .	-5.4030

City and traders are planning " home hoops " -weekend	-3.9419
In September , Bad Langensalzaer and people from the region will rediscover shopping in the city centre .	-3.5364
The Gewerbeverein and Stadtverwaltung want to use the weekend on September 8 and 9 to attract the inhabitants to the city centre .	-5.5660
As the leader of the trade association Christian King pointed out , the " Heimathop " weekend is intended to make customers aware of what offers their own city is offering away from the usual supermarket goods .	-8.5712

Local companies are also expected to present themselves with their training places .	-3.2214
In addition , the city centre 's shops are designed to attract midnight shopping .	-5.4723
The action is not only aimed at residents of the city and the region .	-4.5713
In preparation are commercials on the radio , an Internet video and printed bags that point to the action weekend , says Christian King .	-3.2386
City administration and trade association cooperate with the Chamber of Commerce .	-3.6179

This includes new offers such as the first " Active Day " to the Brunnenfest including sales soffnem Sunday , talks with all traders and hosts to encourage them to participate actively .	-5.7093
Also attractive Saturday offers and the lack of parking fees on this day are part of the concept .	-3.8898
In addition , customer potential is to be redefined or eliminated .	-3.7844
This includes tourists and tourists .	-3.3169
But many locals would also have lost sight of the city centre during shopping .	-4.0244
In the end , everyone should contribute to revitalising the city centre - to landlords , businesses throughout the city and associations .	-5.4179
It was necessary to overcome the lethargy with a network that had partly spread , King said in the spring .	-5.0794
Birgit String , director of the IHK Center in Mühlhausen announced that for the first time , five Thuringian cities are participating in the nationwide " Heimathop " day .	-5.9144
Apart from Bad Langensalza , this is Weimar , Sömmerda , Heiligenstadt and Bleicherode .	-3.6174
The day should ' promote the appreciation of local trade and emphasise its importance to the common good of our cities ' , " said String .	-5.2301
The action under the auspices of the IHK and with many partners also makes it clear that every citizen , with his or her purchasing behaviour , can influence his direct environment .	-7.3065

Trump , after leaked transcripts of phone calls to Mexico , was pressured to pay the border wall .	-4.2648
Call transcripts between US President Donald Trump and leaders of Mexico and Australia were published by the Washington Post .	-2.3174
On 27 January , in a telephone call with Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto , Trump asked to stop saying publicly that he would not pay for a planned border wall .	-2.9857
The US President cut him because he publicly denounced the wall , according to reports he said to him : ' You cannot say this to the press . '	-7.8558
Trump began his presidential campaign with the promise of building a wall on the southern border of the US , voicing that Mexico should pay for the project .	-3.9904
The transcript of his first call with Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull was also published and unveiled a tense exchange .	-3.5311
Mr. Trump said Mr. Turnbull that a trade for the US would make refugees emigrating to Australia " ridiculous " , " mies " , and " stupid " , and that the existence of the trade that was conveyed by the Obama administration would make him look like a " depp " after he had proposed a ban on refugees moving to the US .	-6.2826
Mr Trump ended the call , having told Mr Turnbull , ' that is the most unpleasant call for the whole day ' .	-4.6840
Moore 's Ford-Massacre : activists are revisiting racist Lynchat as a call for justice .	-4.7200
A 1948-year-old Ford Mercury sailed through a group of spectators in rural Monroe , Georgia , and rumored to the Ford Bridge of Moore .	-6.7204
Before the car , the four black passengers and a white driver could reach the bridge , a group of white men appeared with guns to block his way .	-3.8953
The leader of the mob - a middle-aged man in a needle strike suit - took a long train at his cigar and looked looked veriously through the windshield .	-5.1958
Insiders were in constant fear .	-3.5585
" We want to bring these n ---- r Roger ! " hated the man .	-3.2371
" Get him out of the car ! "	-1.5887
Shrine is breaking silence , when a young black man was dragged by the front-passenger seat .	-7.0324
Fortunately , this terrible scene played on 22 July is just an aftertaste .	-3.7217
But when a snake is thrown around the neck of " Roger " , almost all of them hit very real sighs in the audience . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and . , , , ,	-8.2805
Since 2005 , civil rights activists have returned to Moore 's Ford Bridge to imitate the night in which two black couples - Roger and Dorothy Malcom and George and Mae Murray Dorsey - were yelled by Ku Klux Klan in 1946 .	-5.0582
No one has ever been indicted for the murders .	-1.9600
" It is really incredible that in all these years no single person has been arrested - although we see them in our communities , although we know who they are , " said Tyrone Brooks , who helps to organise the recruitment .	-4.4716
" It is a stain on a history , but it is a burden on our souls . "	-2.9307
Brooks is a 71-year-old former Congressman of the State of Georgia and long-life civil rights activist .	-2.8463
For him , replication serves as a dramatic call for action , and constitutes an annual reminder to the Monroe community that an injustice has never been corrected .	-3.7169
" We want prosecution , we want the end , we want cure , we want reconciliation , but first we need justice , " he said .	-3.3549
'We cannot get healing and reconciliation until we receive justice ' .	-2.8953
A court practitioner places a bed cloth on the corpse of one of the victims of the Moor Order Lynchens on July 27 , 1946 .	-5.9266
According to FBI files received by NBC News , more than 50 Monroe men and the surrounding counties were suspected in the Lynch process .	-3.2646
But no one has ever been indicted .	-1.5170
Although the suspects have remained at large for decades , civil rights campaigners say that the double motivation for Lynch actions has always been known throughout the city : politics and sex .	-4.3416
In April 1946 , a Supreme Court ruling allowed the black citizens of Georgia to vote in the summer for the first time in the run-up .	-4.6337
About at the same time as the election , according to the FBI , Roger Malcom ’ s black farm farmer , caught a white landowner , Barnett Hester , during a fight - allegedly because of a woman .	-6.2387
Brooks said that the rumor in the city was that Hearter slept with Malcoms Dorothy and that the baby she wore was not from her husband .	-4.4860
On July 25 , 1946 , Loy Harrison , a prominent white landowner , paid $ 600 to free Malcom from prison , said the FBI .	-2.4228
He was jailed by Dorothy and her cousins Mae Murray and George Dorsey .	-2.5086
But when they moved away from prison and approached Moore 's Ford Bridge , a Lynchmob surrounded the car .	-2.8669
" As it turns out , it was Harrison who prepared and ordered the murders , " concludes a FBI report .	-2.4925
" It is also obvious that there was a plot between state and local prosecution , which was not only involved in the murder , removed evidence and concealed the identity of witnesses " .	-5.1047
Brooks puts it even more incisive .	-2.0441
" It was an electoral massacre , " he said .	-1.1697
" You were all killed to send a message to black people in this community : " If you register and when you vote , you will be able to do so here . "	-4.3211
For almost a decade , Cassandra Greene led the annual replication of Moore Ford Bridge Lynch murders .	-2.3526
Their depiction is vivid , poignant , and justified in a kind of deep racism that many would like to believe that it no longer exists in America .	-5.2374
It is hard to watch and even more difficult to look away , but Greene said that is the point .	-3.0782
" We do not want to talk about the Lynchen , because we are then confronted with his ugly presence in all of us , " she said .	-5.1063
" But I can 't build a relationship with you if you don 't want to listen to me or do not want to hear what I 've done . "	-3.8207
The samples for this year 's production began in June , and on the first day , nearly 30 actors - a dozen whites and the rest of the black - came into a room and listened when Greene got a good overview of the play .	-6.3333
Wade Marbaugh is co-director here .	-2.8146
He has played the role of the chief clan for years , but he said that the role will never be easier .	-3.6164
" I feel dirty because I 'm not so , " said Marbaugh .	-1.9380
" But I think it is very important to keep this story alive because we do not want to return to these times . "	-2.3781
On the other side of the room the actors Darrius Bradshaw and Nick Rascona , who play Roger Malcom and Barnett Hecter , tried their lines .	-3.1976
The play begins with Malcom , who is dressed up and afflicted , angry that he has slept with his wife Dorothy .	-4.8636
" I said n --- he , waste of my property ! "	-1.8851
Rascona responds to fire .	-2.6066
There is a break .	-0.8159
And then everyone ( at least all black actors ) breaks out in laughter .	-2.7102
Greene laughs the loudest .	-0.9298
" What ? ! " asked Rascona .	-2.5117
It is alarming and confused .	-0.8398
Was I too harsh ?	-1.5190
'No ' , Greene said , still kicking .	-3.5816
" I simply do not think that white people said ' n --- he ' . '	-4.3542
" But " , " quipped one of the other black actors .	-3.0367
" You only have to hit the hard ' R. ' ' .	-5.7269
And that is exactly where energy moves in the room , a feeling of cameramenity replaces the unease .	-6.0359
Everyone is busy getting this right , not only because of the game , but also because of the memory of the four people killed .	-3.0649
The scene starts again .	-1.4253
This time , when Rascona says the N word , he says it loud and strong .	-3.4844
Absolutely no one laughs .	-2.2228
This repetition ends violent and fast .	-2.1957
There are cries , shots and then silence .	-1.4459
A woman dressed with a sadness stands above the corpse of the actors and performs Billie Holidays a fervent eulogy called " Strange Fruit " .	-7.7621
Their voice breaks on each second word .	-2.3085
About a hundred meters behind it , a group of about four dozen spectators caught sweat and tears out of the eyes .	-5.3842
The audience is almost evenly divided between black and white .	-2.1008
A couple came from Ithaca , New York , to see the performance , many only come down the road .	-2.6962
They have experienced Georgias ’ oppressive humidity every eight hours when Brooks leads them to the graves of Malcoms and Dorseys on a pilgrimage trip .	-6.0475
Up to that point , the murders have remained an anecdote , but now , when you stand in the same country where the Lynch murders took place , the air feels nervous .	-4.7433
When the last notes of the song end , Greene invites you to get closer and inspect the body name .	-3.2953
Children watch on their heads , register the fake blood and the silent bodies and whisper each other .	-4.4148
" They are not really dead , " mumbles a little boy as if he wanted to remember it .	-5.2917
After a few minutes thanks Greene the crowd - and suddenly it 's over .	-2.8472
The actors cast the Lynchheir away and cast away their tears .	-3.0648
Bradshaw surrounded Marbaugh , the man in suit who played the clan member .	-3.0921
Nick Rascona huffles two of his fellow players and then engages in their poor , and the emotional burden of performance ultimately breaks out with him .	-6.3224
" It is okay " , one of the women whispers .	-2.2085
" We know that this is not your heart .	-1.9977
You did it for one reason . '	-1.8010
Later , the audience met the actors for dinner .	-3.4020
At a table a white pair from Atlanta speculates on the reproduction with a black pair they have just met .	-5.2217
Denise Dulinski fought to find words that left her feeling of performance .	-4.7023
" It is difficult to hear these terrible words and deeds ... to come from people who look like you and do it because they look like you , " she said .	-3.2334
" What really does with me leaves me believe that the Lynchen is still going on , " she added , " today it is called only police chory . "	-6.4184
In the same room , Tyrone Brooks courtyard keeps his table , he eats and reminds of citizens ' rights .	-4.6989
He said he already started planning the performance next year .	-2.5722
" The reproduction is in some way inspiring , because it describes the horror of what we have drowned , but it is also a moment of learning , " he said .	-4.1744
" It 's like we don 't learn anything from it , then it can happen again .	-3.4540
Those who do not study their own history , who do not know their own history , are condemned to repeat it . '	-3.6852
" Goetterdawn " reconciled the Wagnerian in Bayreuth .	-3.9760
In the fourth part of Richard Wagner ’ s monumental work , director Frank Castorf also relies on a colorful frivole staging against gigantic , six-storey scenery .	-5.5698
The turning-stage ( designed by Aleksandar Denic ) offers a shabby street corner with wall and Dönerbude in Berlin , a " Plaste and Elaste " logo from GDR times or the New York Stock Exchange .	-5.7483
Before that , an open Mercedes classic car was parked , in which the Rhine killers would like Rockergirls , or alternatively an Isaetta .	-6.6242
Oilfässer practised reminds of Castorf 's leitmotif - money , power and greed - which draws on its " Ring " staging .	-6.1721
The three Rhine daughters - sang by Stephanie Houtzeel , Wiebke Lehmkuhl and Alexandra Steiner - harmonize as well as the " Rheingold " wonderful .	-3.9795

Brutal the scene when he shot Siegfried .	-1.1942
Gunther ( Markus Eiche ) later has to believe in this .	-3.9383
The audience thanks the ensemble with strong applause .	-2.5373
It is a celebration of Foster , Milling , Vinke and conductor Janowski , who is humble and banishing his hands to merciless noise . the of . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.0050
There is great applause for the Festival Orchestra , which will be shown for the first time on stage - in view of the heat again in more sober leisure clothing .	-7.6016
The appearance of Frank Castorf and his director was eagerly awaited .	-5.0476
If he had to go through a dominant pillar concert in 2013 , there were five years later big jubils in which the isolated " buh " round went .	-8.6178
Festival leader Katharina Wagner should have been pleased with this .	-3.8293
" It is noticed that the audience has grown in a way with the " ring " , she said shortly before performing the dpa .	-5.8038
Not only did the audience make a form of peace with Castorf , but it also grew an understanding of its view .	-4.7370
I have a positive balance .	-2.6268

EPA returns to a decision to delay the smog rule	-3.3529
The US Environmental Protection Agency has lifted a decision to delay Obama ’ s administration , requiring states to contain emissions caused by smoke-causing emissions , a day after 15 states sued the Agency for the move .	-6.3643

" We believe in dialogue with and in responding to our state partners , " said EPA-chief Scott Pruitt in a statement .	-3.4846
In June , Pruitt announced the intention of the EPO to delay the ozone provisions - in which emissions of pollutants are to be measured in a part of the country to determine where cuts need to be made to meet stricter standards of air quality - in order to delay one year until October 2018 .	-6.8484
A group of 15 mostly democratic states , together with the Colombia district , filed a complaint on Tuesday and said that the effort was illegal .	-3.9237
President Donald Trump ’ s administration has tried to reduce a wide range of environmental requirements imposed by former President Barack Obama as part of a broader agenda that Trump says will boost economic growth .	-4.1938

Municipal Council Want Community Space	-1.8211
In the end , the decision was clear : with two votes against , the local council of Flurn-Wingots decides to create a common space in the future home for senior citizens .	-7.0982
Before the discussion , there is an important information : the purchase contract for the missing land force has been signed , reports Mayor Bernhard Tjaden .	-4.2450
Although it will take some time for the local area , which has been part of the church , there is now no obstacle to planning the project to be carried out by a private investor .	-6.5896
There is a discussion about this in relation to a Community area .	-3.5552
One of the two investors still in the boat has offered to meet the community .	-2.9316
On the ground floor it would provide a living area - around 55 square meters - and an adjoining terrace with a surface of 70 square meters for a special price .	-4.6705
The administration and the majority of the municipal council agree to provide such a common space not only as a meeting place for the residents of senior citizens , but openly into the community .	-7.0557
As an example , the word from the " Strickcafé " made the round .	-3.0546
The decision which was made by the provision of funds for the current budget last autumn will be postponed by means of funding possibilities .	-5.4374
The building is located in the recovery area .	-3.3105
The creation of a Community area , according to Tjaden , would be eligible for funding at 60 % of the total .	-4.3087
The proposal for a decision , in order to send a signal to the investor that in this respect they do not want to throw a stick between the legs , provides for the observation that both the saddle - which is related to the building of the environment - and the powder roof - would be possible , reducing the amount of grapes and making the construction more economical .	-10.0514
Not only Wilfried Sohmer believes that this addition is unnecessary .	-3.5431
If 's helps : unanimity passes the board .	-3.8920
The Community area is not as simple as that .	-2.4201

Yvonne Stager is strongly in favour of the Community area - but absolutely opposed to community participation .	-4.6513
It sees a hidden subsidy to already well-off or even foreign investors .	-4.0384
That is not the case , because the purchase of the surface does not give a grant , but rather receives a real equivalent that can be marketed in the event of doubt , is the counter-statement .	-7.1885
Stager ’ s request to split the proposal accordingly has three supporters .	-4.7552

Hiking in the Harz of Stern	-1.3603
The first " Star Trail " is to be created in the Harz region of Germany .	-3.9044
The association Plannerwarte Sankt Andreasberg plans this .	-4.0708
A planetary path exists in Göttingen - since 2003 .	-2.0476
A " Star-Path " is in response to the information needs of many visitors to Harz .	-6.6215
It combines nature , science , movement and sporting performance .	-2.3755
Members want to set up along the planned route panels and inform about stars and constellations .	-5.0475
In the first phase until 2018 , the Association plans " well accessible installations in five to six places " in Oberharz .	-4.8983
Infrage could be St. Andreasberg , Braun , Hohenschei<unk> and Sieber .	-5.4636
Information on the panels is to be supplemented via the Internet .	-3.9121
Therefore , a good mobile network reception is important for location selection .	-4.5536
Freedom of access is also a criterion .	-1.4743
The Star Trail Ticket is to be expanded later .	-5.3642
" On the star-trail the viewer will learn a lot of interesting facts , for example about the physics of the individual stars , " explained the association .	-5.1628
They also learned why stars had different colors , or why a star was brighter than another , although it was much further away .	-4.3007
It also deals with the star in which a selected star is located and when it is best to see .	-4.5794
Since 2014 , the association has been operating the highest observatory in northern Germany in the mountain town of St. Andreasberg .	-5.1761
According to the Bundesamtes for Nature Conservation , the location in the heart of the Harz National Park is one of the six darkest regions in Germany .	-3.9431
Often , you can see the Milky Way from there and even the Andromeda galaxy with a mere eye .	-4.7386
Since 2003 , on the initiative of the Planetarium Göttingen , there is something similar to the planned star design - the Planetenweg .	-5.7625
Starting in front of Gebhards Hotel in the Goetheallee , which forms the interior of our solar system , the Planetenweg with its steels leads up to the Hainberg and the Sternwarte - as well as a " outdoors " site in Diemarden ( municipality equals ) with the planet Sedna .	-6.5536
The steels with the individual planets - including the dwarf planned Pluto at the end point - are placed exactly at the distance and scale from one to two billion .	-4.9602
The Earth is thus shrinking to a globe of 6.5 millimeters in diameter , while the exactly 75 meters distant sun at least measures 70 centimeters .	-5.6709
The entire distance of the planetary path is four kilometers .	-3.8970
While light from sun to Pluto takes about eight hours , pedestrians need a good hour to the bridge with Pluto .	-3.8213
Pedestrians are therefore faster than the light in the universe .	-1.9677
But the march to the next fix star would take half a year .	-2.8411

" I am a former featherweight , " Garcia reminded .	-3.3621
" I grew up for bronze [ at 140 pounds ] , but I 'm not so big .	-2.9407
I am small for 140 .	-1.0236
I would like to come down to light weight .	-2.8593
And he must move to lightweight [ 135 pounds ] and then we fight .	-2.7229
This is what the fans are demanding .	-2.3593
Let us give them that . '	-0.9652
Lomé agreed .	-1.6661
'Boxing needs this fight ' .	-2.1708
Climate asked whether it should be on pay-per-view , part of a strategy that must fight Lomachenko with a 135-pound debut this year to agree a date with Garcia next summer ( 37-0 , 30 Knockouts ) , which also has interest in the fight against the winner of Jorge Linares-Luke Campbell for their lightweight title fight in the Forum on September 23 .	-8.1382
" This fight could take place in Pay-per-View-mode because all fans asked for it , " Garcia said , and later expressed his willingness to fight on the network that offers the best financial package .	-6.0033
We are the best .	-0.6276
No other names can generate this kind of attention .	-1.5313
Whenever they are ready ... '	-1.1828

Garcia said that the focus is to show strength , then boxing .	-3.0801
Both said they could feel the momentum they were building up for their own struggle .	-4.0217
" This is the battle that must be carried out .	-2.2691
No other fight creates so much attention and enthusiasm .	-2.3181
I am more than happy to work on it , " said Garcia .	-1.6246

Fortunas Hoffmann : ' Trier is working better '	-4.4825
Andre Hoffmann hopes , after the 2 : 2 season opening against Braunschweig , that the optimization of the defense formation in Aue points .	-4.5651
Andre Hoffmann was satisfied with the first season , but the result would not have been the two opposing players at 2 : 2 against Braunschweig .	-5.2847
" The two extremes were too much , and we need to be even more careful in Aue , " says the opposition player from Fortuna Düsseldorf . , , , and . .	-8.3235
In the Erzgebirge the trie-ranges are also to be further optimized .	-4.4799
And a gateway to a free ride does not want to capture the lagoons any more .	-6.1985
" For the future it will be so that no one will stand in line with Michael ( Rensing ) . "	-4.9056
Hoffmann is convinced that his team will be better equipped even after the experience of preparing the three-way chain than with the four team .	-6.5567
" Still I don 't know how we will act in Aue , " says his trainer Friedhelm Fundel , but Hoffmann is sure of his thing , " because we have semi-positions in Kaan Ayhan and Niko Gieelmann players who can build well , " Hoffmann said .	-5.8988
" It is essential , but that we harmonize even better and we do not afford so many mistakes in the construction . "	-7.1694
Of course , Hoffmann also goes to Aue to win the game .	-2.2397
" Whether you can speak of a failed start after a draw is not known .	-5.0261
The performance might well be okay , " Hoffmann meant .	-3.7660
" If , however , we have four points on Sunday and can concentrate on the Cup , we will certainly be able to talk about an orderly seasonal event . "	-6.2998
His coach did not want to know anything about this .	-3.2193
" I judged the start of the season only after six to eight days " , said Friedhelm Fundel , who does not want to speak of an advantage over Aue , just because the game of Saxony had to be cancelled early in Heidenheim because of a storm .	-5.8968
" Now they can start the season almost with a home game , " says Fundel and Hoffmann said that the players from Aue might even be a bit more fresh , because they would not have a heavy and complete game like Fortuna against a ascent favorite .	-6.9869
" But they do not know as 100 % where they currently stand , " says the inner defender of the Fortuna .	-3.8979
Although guests from the Rhineland are going to meet in the final ( almost ) finished stadium of Aue on Sunday as a lighter .	-5.9764
" The fact that we are fighting them just because we are entitled to come under the first six is stupid , " says Fundel , whose balance in only one defeat against Aue from nine games is very positive .	-6.5530
" There is no team in the 2nd Bundesliga that needs to be beaten from the start , " says Fortuna 's Chief coach .	-5.5114
" To make such a statement would be arrogant and arrogant " .	-1.6353
And so Fundel will not be able to see his players on Sunday .	-5.2265
New results of the Swedish asylum age assessment tests published	-4.1977
The recent results of tests on asylum seekers in Sweden , which have been subjected to a new method of medical assessment of their age , show that more than 80 % of those tested are over 18 years , but not everyone believes in the accuracy of . are . , , and , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.3198
The Swedish authority for Forensic Medicine ( Rätsmäginalveret ) started the tests last year .	-5.9540
They should make the assessment of age more accurate during the asylum procedure after the Swedish migration authority ( migration fee ) was criticised for errors in assessing the correct age of some refugees who were minors .	-5.4908
To date , migration fee has sent 6,880 cases to be tested , and the Forest Medicine Agency has now released the results of a total of 2,481 tests from mid-March to 31st July 2017 .	-4.4679
Eighty percent ( 2002 ) were judged as 18 or older , while in another 25 cases the Forest Medicine Agency judged that the person was " possibly 18 years or older " .	-4.0079
In 432 cases , the conclusion was that the person " may be under 18 years old " .	-2.2851
The tests are carried out only in cases where the person 's age is questioned .	-2.6214
According to Johan Göransson of the Forest Medicine Agency , the results have been consistent in recent months .	-2.4782
" We see no big difference in the statistics of recent months , the numbers are fairly constant , " he said the journal The Local .	-3.5630
The high proportion of cases in which the person has been judged for over 18 years does not necessarily mean that the asylum seeker has lied over his age .	-3.4371
In May , the agency published the results of 581 tests and said that there were 442 cases which ' propose that the examined person be 18 years or older ' .	-3.5891
When the newspaper Svenska Dagblad investigated the 581 published results , it found that in 243 of these cases the person had openly said that it would be 18 years old this year .	-4.3300
The method of medical age evaluation , in which X-ray images of wisdom teeth and MRT from knee joints are then analysed by dentists and radiologists , was also criticised in some areas .	-6.2600
A skeptic is the endocrinologist Claude Marcus of the Karolinka Institute , whose work involves the assessment of the biological maturity of humans to see whether they were previously , or later , usually through puberty .	-5.1420
" I had reason to think about it , and I do not think the type of measurement should be used .	-2.5201
evaluating biological age in this way is very uncertain .	-2.5434
If we cannot say it safely , we should not pretend we could , " he said the newspaper Metro .	-4.0472
Göransson of the Forensic Medicine Agency , however , defended the accuracy of tests : " In general , you can say that the risk of a child being misjudged as an adult is low .	-6.1485
The greatest risk is that , if the person is under 18 , in this case it is about 10 % . '	-4.7059
Full the Plan	-1.4845
Work on the three bridges of the highway 108 between Lauterbach and Schramberg is progressing well .	-2.0664
On Wednesday , a seven-tonne heavy concrete section was installed on the bridge at the eastern entrance of the village of Lauterbach .	-3.4753
" We are very good at the time , it is running super " , says Reinhold Leicht , Construction Manager at the Department of Road and Transport in the Government Presidium Freiburg .	-5.3579
In April , work began simultaneously on all three reconstructive bridges between Schramberg and Lauterbach .	-4.0081
The end is scheduled for October and it is easy to ensure that the timetable is adhered to .	-4.1458
The first bridge , coming from Schramberg , leads across the Trombach .	-2.9197
It is a cobbled bridge made of concrete , covered with red buntsstone and has a total length of 4.80 meters .	-5.3498
It was built in 1900 .	-1.4546
Like the other two bridges , it has come into the years .	-3.0976
In order to ensure stability and road safety , the three buildings are now carefully reconstructed .	-4.5335
The other two bridges pass through the Lauterbach .	-2.6504
They are made of red buntsandstein .	-2.1391
Both were built in 1939 and are twelve or 10,60 metres long .	-3.0041
On Wednesday morning , on the north side , the bridge at the entrance of the town of Lauterbach received a 1,30 m wide and seven tons of heavy so-called bridge cap .	-10.4450
This is an attachment that is also used as an operating path .	-3.2380
On the southern part of the bridge a 2,20 metres wide bridge cap is to be used on Friday .	-4.9768
This is what the pedestrian way should be about .	-3.8888
The particular thing is that these are finished parts , a patent of the Schramberg company Dizco .	-4.7113
The other two bridges are already equipped with patented bridge caps .	-2.0601
A special sensitivity has required the laying of lines through the Lauterbach building .	-4.2315
Because there is also a glass-fibre cable that many companies are connected to .	-4.5233
The local people were informed about the project in advance of the work by means of a leaflet .	-5.6405
In addition , fish and crabs had to be fished first .	-2.9699
For the bridges between the Bauhofhaus building and the collecting weir in the direction of Schramberg , the traffic is once and for all regulated by an traffic light .	-6.5493
The road in the area of the bridge at the Lauterbach entrance is completely locked at the height of the hotels " Tannhof " and " Sieben Linden " .	-5.0374
The cost of the three bridge installations is EUR 700 000 .	-2.9605
The whole thing is financed by the country .	-2.0642
AfD in Gerolstein : Bund protest in German potato salad	-2.7497
It is not so often the case that parties pull together , but when it comes to the Alternative für Deutschland ( AfD ) , it comes together , which is otherwise difficult to reconcile .	-6.0818
The parties ( CDU , SPD , Green , FDP , FWG , Leftist ) , represented in the District Day , belong to a broad alliance that displays a peaceful flag on that day , because the AfD invites the Gerolsteiner Stadthalle Rondell to the poster " grand campaign ceremony " .	-7.5745
And known names bring to the start - like Alice Weidel , who , together with Alexander Gauland , is the top duet for the federal election on September 24 , and the deputy Federal Chairman Beatrix of Storch .	-6.0497
But those who are already hours ahead of the event do not want to listen to the AfD people , but to demonstrate .	-5.0492
The motto ' The egg stops colourful ' .	-4.3050
Originally , the city icknick was planned under the motto " All at a table " on the Brunnenplatz , but now takes place on the parking below the Rondell - and thus directly in front of the eyes of those who come to the AfD event in the city hall .	-7.7120
A colorful picture there is .	-3.3542
And what Christa Karoli , Chairman of the Forum A World and one of the authoritative organizers , really looks forward to : " Why how many people have come together here " .	-5.8404
There is music and a lot of food , including a " primordial potato salad that the AfD could eat easily " , says the woman who brought him along .	-4.3573
The police ordered many officials to Gerolstein , and they showed presence in the train station , which is only a few metres away from the venues .	-6.6715
How did the AfD actually come on Gerolstein ?	-2.0331
Mario Hompes of the AfD Volcanoeifel reports that he has tried to do this and received the addition .	-6.1944
The 45-year-old from Gönnersdorf had initially asked in Daun , but had received a cancellation because there was not enough parking space because of the already built Laurentiuskirmes .	-6.6906
Now the Rondell , Hompes is pleased that " we can have such a nice event here " .	-3.2165
With regard to the event at Rondellvorplatz he says : " This is the good right of the people , basically it remains peaceful " .	-4.5273
At 8 p.m. there is a band for entertainment at Rondellvorplatz , in the city hall various speakers , including the head of the Rhine Appendix AfD-chair Uwe Jung .	-8.4019
In the hall are about 200 listeners waiting for top contestants for the federal election , Alice Weidel , and the deputy Federal President Beatrix of Storch to make their speeches .	-5.3784
The police presence is inconspicuous , but so far the officials have had a quiet evening .	-3.8074
The AfD event lasts a little more than an hour , guests on the front desk have a longer breath , but there is also a short time after 21 o 'clock .	-7.5165
The police can retreat - no special events .	-2.9374

Both soloists are winners and winners of numerous international competitions and hold solo positions in top European orchestras .	-3.4525
Petkov is a solo trumpet with the renowned Concert gebouw Orchestra of Amsterdam and Frederic Belli is a solo pianist of the SWR Symphony orchestra .	-5.9141
Both combine the desire not only to cross borders on their instruments , but also to merge the boundaries of the different genres .	-3.3451
Johann Sebastian Bach works in the two as well as in a new style , Daniel Schnyders " Weltmusik " combines with Bulgarian folklore , and in the song " Exchange Suite " of the jazz composer Nils Heubram , mixing classical , jazz and free playing to a fascinating total of art .	-8.0203

In the meantime , on Thursday evening , the Republican National Committee issued a statement saying : ' The change of party by Governor Justice is another blow to a Democratic Party that would prevent us from working rather than to make our country great again ' .	-6.0400

The world leader of athletics , Sebastian Coe , praised on Thursday what he described as a blatant apology from Russia for a doping scandal , but he repeated that it was not the moment for the country to resume sports .	-4.3939

He said he is sorry for " all athletes caught gold and silver medals in contests " .	-3.5968
Despite his comments , the IAAF Congress voted to maintain the ban imposed in November 2015 after a report by the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) found evidence of state-sponsored doping in Russia .	-2.8203
" I thought it was a very open answer today , a very honest presentation , " said IAAF President Coe to the reporters .	-2.3925
" The entire Council and Congress were delighted that the Russian Federation itself realised that it had some rather hot times and will do everything possible to ensure that the Federation is reorganized . "	-5.3971
Coe said that he was also " pleased " that Russia accepted the criteria for its reintroduction .	-3.2458
" I think it was a very constructive day and I think progress has been made , but Congress supports the recommendations of the task force that this is not the moment to reinstate Russia , " said Coe .	-2.8513
" We must do everything in the coming months to normalise this situation .	-2.4874
The guiding principle was always that we wanted to separate clean athletes from the dead system , " he added .	-2.1113

These include Hessen ’ s Prime Minister Volker Bouffier ( CDU ) and the general inspector of the Bundeswehr Volker Wieker .	-3.7536
Sadly , rose fell , the relatives were arm of the coffin .	-5.6662

Doubts about the UN mission in Mali did not show Secretary of the Leyen : the deployment was dangerous .	-3.7534
But he was also very important ' for a country of which we are only divided by two states ' , she said .	-3.8530
After the ceremony , the coffins were taken from the Cathedral .	-4.7079

The man of the Danish Queen Margrethe ( 77 ) , Prince Henrik ( 83 ) , will not be buried beside his wife after his death .	-2.6617
That was what happened to the Königshaus on Thursday .	-4.1286
Traditionally , the Danish royal couple is buried in the cathedral of Roskilde .	-3.0332
Bildhauer Bj<unk>rn N<unk>rgaard has already produced one sarcophagus for the two .	-3.0250
The queen was in agreement with her husband ’ s decision , as was stated in the communication .	-6.6315
Where Prince Henrik is buried is still unclear .	-2.4511
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland .	-2.6396
Prince Henrik never had made a secret of not happy with his title .	-2.6395
After the throne of his wife Margrethe in 1972 , he would have liked to become king .	-3.2266
In 2016 , he retired , also dismissing the title " Prince gemahl " .	-5.5925
Since Henrik in Denmark did not get the title and function he wanted , he does not see himself as equal to his wife - even after death , Lene Balleby , the Danish Royal House ’ s chief spokesperson , explained .	-6.8847
Where the final retirement of the 83-year old will be , remains unclear .	-4.2113
But he does not intend to be buried in his French homeland , but in Denmark .	-3.0419

My Danish was pregnant , I preferred wine instead of beer , silk stockings instead of knicks , Citro<unk>n instead of Volvo , tennis instead of football .	-3.7201

Prime Minister Weil wants a speedy re-election	-2.4678
CDU and FDP before possible majority in Lower Saxony	-1.7376
Lower Saxony Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) , after the loss of the red-green government majority , is in favour of a rapid re-election of the day of land , but he does not want to resign .	-4.7437
Because it was on Friday that Parliament was dissolved .	-3.3464
Previously , the surprise of a Green MEP ’ s departure from her country ’ s parliament in Lower Saxony had plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil ’ s government into a severe crisis .	-5.2904
Five months before the official date of the country election , the red-green coalition in Hanover thus lost its narrow one-minute majority in parliament to the opposition from the CDU and FDP .	-5.6739
The previous Green MEP Elke Tsungen justified her step with the non-nomination for the 2018 election in her constituency in Rotenburg ( Wümme ) .	-4.7077
" I see my political future in the CDU " , she explained on Friday in Hanover .	-2.1610
CDU leader Björn Thümler would recommend to his group that they should be admitted .	-4.2951
Thus , CDU and FDP together would have 69 seats in Lower Saxony ’ s Landtag , SPD , and Greens ’ 68 seats .	-4.4527
So far , the ratio has been reversed .	-1.6870
The new day of land is regularly elected on 14 January next year .	-3.1915
Thümler said that the red-green government of the country must now decide whether it can continue to govern without a majority in this situation .	-4.4897
However , Stephan Weil considers it essential that the land day should decide on its own replacement as soon as possible .	-5.0435
The CDU Group is expected to decide on the next step on Tuesday .	-2.8112
The national constitution also provides for the possibility that the country day will deprive the Prime Minister of trust and elect a successor .	-4.6535
" Our Constitution offers several options .	-1.3730
These possibilities have to be properly examined , " said Thümler .	-3.9598
'You will calmly discuss all questions when they are legally reasonable . '	-4.6945
Thümler called Twestens step " yet somewhat kurios " .	-3.8513
The politician himself stressed : ' I am not a traitor .	-2.0278
I feel very good ' .	-1.0306
She referred to her as an attachment of black green .	-3.6279
The Greens called on the breakaway Members to return their parliament 's mandate .	-4.2591
" We assume , of course , that she returns with immediate effect her country day mandate , which she received through the green country list , " the country chairmen Meta Janssen-Klubz and Stefan Körner co-wrote .	-8.4276
The Chairman of the Group of the Greens / European Free Alliance , Anja Piel , said : ' We regret the decision taken by Elke Twalvest ' .	-4.6644
You have deliberately decided not to have a debate in the group .	-2.9379
" Even in the light of the fact that there were no differences in content , we cannot understand this step . "	-4.6300
SPD Chancellor Martin Schulz condemns the passage of the Lower Saxony Green MEP Elke Tvest to the CDU as treason .	-4.6004
" The behaviour of the former Green MEPs in Lower Saxony is not only betrayal of the electorate , but also betrayal of the Red Green , " wrote the Social Democrats ’ leader on Facebook on Friday .	-5.2299
It supports Prime Minister Stephan Weil ( SPD ) ’ s decision to have land day re-elected quickly .	-4.1877
The Twestens exit costs Rot-Grün in Lower Saxony the majority .	-3.2528
The politician " in her wounded vanity and in her frustration her personal interests before the welfare of the country " , criticized SPD Secretary-General Hubertus Heil .	-4.5456
" It is scandalous that the CDU is participating in the Lower Saxony of this dirty intrial game and is trying to beat political capital from it . "	-5.9699
Niedersachsen CDU leader Björn Thümler will recommend to his members that Elke Tvest should be admitted to the CDU .	-5.3623
The SPD ’ s leader in the Bundestag , Thomas Opponermann , accused Twalvest of distorting the outcome of the 2013 country election with personal career thinking .	-6.4201
At that time , the CDU was the strongest force before the SPD , but the Social Democrats and the Greens had a lofty majority of one vote in the country .	-5.2493
Agriculture Minister in the interview - How do we protect ourselves from poisonous eggs , Mr Schmidt ?	-2.7806
Germany is discussing contaminated eggs .	-0.7672
How could the scandal happen ?	-0.9583
How can consumers protect themselves .	-0.9917
Secretary of Agriculture Christian Schmidt ( CSU ) is speaking and answering in an interview with the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-4.0501
Mr Schmidt , how can consumers protect themselves from poisoned eggs ?	-2.0130
I can only encourage all consumers to look closely at the eggs in your refrigerator and to check the stamp printing .	-3.9667
At the Consumer Protection Portal www.Foerwarung.de the federal states submit the latest information about the Eier Chargen in question .	-7.0054
Affected eggs should be destroyed or returned .	-1.8645
Even if , according to everything we know at the moment , health risks are practically excluded .	-3.5866
Is Aldi now overtaking the best crisis response possible - all eggs out of supply - because the central role of the Enlightenment is not really taken up by the Federal Minister for Economic Affairs ?	-5.5188
Food monitoring is a task for the federal states .	-2.9818
Nevertheless , my House has opened up without delay and has been in close contact with the authorities of the countries since it became known that Germany was . are . are , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.4399
All information and risk assessment are available to consumers .	-1.9079
Trade , like manufacturers , must ensure that the products sold are marketable and safe for health .	-4.5215
If the maximum residue content of 0.005mg / kg is exceeded for eggs , these are not transportable .	-4.5757
Unburdened eggs can however be sold and eaten .	-3.1857
This time , business is not to blame .	-2.3192
Does manufacturing and consumer sitting in the same boat ?	-2.2836
According to current knowledge , production companies are not directly responsible .	-4.5107
Instead , they must face economic damage due to alleged illegal practices by service companies .	-3.5889
As always , there are too few inspectors in the worst case .	-2.2534
Is it only a matter of personnel or of key competence ?	-3.7317
It was the official controls that revealed the matter .	-3.2686
The truth , however , is that food fraud and criminal energy cannot be completely excluded .	-2.7032
It is precisely for this reason that consistent information on such events and the transfer to the public prosecutor 's offices in cases where criminal offences may be available are crucial .	-6.5680
I have already made it clear on several occasions that I expect full information from the responsible authorities .	-3.3849
Is regular alarm really necessary in food scandals ?	-3.7698
Consumers have the right to obtain only safe and viable food .	-3.3779
When an unacceptable insecticide is used in the food industry , consumers are rightly indignant .	-2.5479
The money involved has led manufacturers , traders and consumers to a situation that is absolutely unnecessary .	-4.3618
Basically , it must be clear that the unlawful use of insecticides Fipronyl in the attitude of food-producing animals is unacceptable and must be brought to an end without delay .	-5.0847
This must be done consistently and with high pressure at all levels .	-3.0776
I expect all the competent authorities to clarify the situation quickly and in full .	-4.0204
How does football ’ s financial rules affect Neymar ’ s move to Paris ?	-3.7542
The rules aimed at preventing the unfettered expenditures of European football clubs will not disrupt Neymars ’ World Record transfer from Barcelona to Paris in Spain .	-5.5140
Some consequences will still come for Paris Saint-Germain of the UEFA , because the leading organisation that oversees the European game has the power to ban teams from gaining access to the prestigious Champions League Tournament .	-5.8029
Financial fair play rules set up by UEFA in 2011 mean that PSG must prove at some point that transfers from Neymar were financed without any major losses .	-4.8936
Barcelona has paid EUR 222 million ( $ 262 million ) to get the Brazilian out of its treaty , and Neymar will receive a salary that will amount to several ten million dollars per year .	-3.8012
Here are some of the financial aspects of Neymar 's move to France .	-2.0659
PSG can surely relax the money so that Neymar signs it and bring it into a galaxy of other stars , given the financing of the team through the energy-rich Qatar family .	-5.9795
Clubs may spend a lot of money on purchasing players , but must deal with legitimate sources of revenue that allow them to break points in their Soccer business .	-7.1798
FFP was conceived by Michel Platini as President of UEFA in 2007 .	-2.6267
Former French players believed that if banks or owners cut back their support , clubs that had incurred huge debts in their quest for success would effectively deceive and risk destroying themselves .	-5.2561
In 2011 , FFP shifted from its focus on club debt to monitoring its losses .	-2.1400
The change meant that the business model , originally used in Chelsea in 2003 , bought a club with potential and then invested heavily to improve the team and build a global brand , should become a stronger business .	-4.0587
During the current three-year FFP retirement period , which runs until 2018 , clubs can accept losses of EUR 30 million .	-4.4851
And , though Platini fell in disfavor by the presidency in 2015 , his UEFA successor , Aleksander Ceferin , is continuing to campaign against excessive spending .	-4.4242
" Certainly FFP is not dead and we will certainly strengthen the rules for the future , " said Andrea Traverso , who is responsible for FFP at UEFA , to The Associated Press last week .	-2.3738
Although the PSG has paid for Neymar ’ s buy-out clause in a package , it can distribute the amount for invoicing over the duration of its contract .	-4.6053
Neymar has signed a five-year contract , which means that the resolution sum for the next five years can be recorded in the annual accounts of EUR 44.4 million .	-6.8200
The first wave of FFP sanctions in 2014 , together with Abu Dhabi , owned by Manchester City , has met the most severe sanctions .	-3.2616
The PSG received a fine of € 60 million ( $ 82 million at that time ) , which was later reduced to € 20 million - and it was ordered that the team members for the 2014 / 15 Champions League will be limited to 21 players instead of the otherwise normal 25 players .	-4.8814
UEFA is looking for clubs that could try to overlist their financial supervision by increasing their revenue by companies associated with club owners .	-4.6357
Whereas a catarian company could sponsor PSG if the value of sponsorship were to exceed the standard market rates , UEFA would not have this as a legitimate income .	-7.1162
This was what happened in 2014 , when UEFA decided that the value of PSA ’ s sponsorship was inflated by the Qatar Tourism Authority .	-3.0352
It has been reported that some of the PSG payments to Neymar could come to Qatar with payments from the organizing committee of the 2022 World Cup . , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.4294
But PSG and Qatar 2022 denied that Neymar will become the World Cup Ambassador , and that such a manoeuvre for the UEFA regulators could be easy to find out .	-5.5498
Existing sanctions against PSG mean that UEFA will be even more attentive to any attempt to circumvent the rules .	-2.9351
The UEFA did not have preparatory discussions with PSG on Neymars 's transfer , said on Thursday the people who are familiar with the situation .	-6.2706
They spoke to The Associated Press on condition of anonymity , since they were not authorised to discuss the PSG situation .	-3.0757
The latest reports show that PSG 2015 / 16 , with a turnover of 542.4 million euros , has achieved a profit of more than EUR 10 million .	-4.2093
The accounts for the last financial year have yet to be published .	-2.4385
PSG expects Neymar ’ s arrival to be a boon for sponsorship deals , merchandising and trikot sales .	-4.1399
The club expects sales to increase by at least 30 percent after signing .	-3.3254
The Spanish League was clearly irritated to see one of the best football players going , and she tried to prevent Neymar ’ s move by claiming that PSG would violate the FFP .	-4.3738
" It is a clear case of " financial doping " with the club and the state , " said the President of the La League , Javier Tebas , the Spanish daily AS in relation to Qatar 's final ownership of PSG .	-3.8233
Arsenal Manager Arsenal Wenger , whose association is owned by an American sports tycoon , shares the reservations of La League against a state that finances an association .	-3.2827
" It is the consequence of ownership and that has completely changed the entire landscape of football over the last 15 years , " Wenger said on Thursday .	-3.2366
" Once a country has a club , everything is possible .	-2.3892
It will be very difficult to respect the financial fair because you can go different ways or have different interests if a country has such a major player to represent a country . '	-4.5486
Swiss is looking for a new Schoggilieferene	-3.4490
In recent years , Chocolat Frey has produced cabin chocolate for the Swiss .	-2.2988
Sweeping cooperation is now at a possible end : the airline is rewriting the order .	-4.6424
Swiss-Prescherin Meike Fullscrap confirmed on request by the news agency sda a corresponding report from Friday 's newspaper Nordwestswez .	-5.7077
According to current planning , the Airline will conclude a new contract in the first half of 2018 .	-5.6277
The products would be reviewed every two to three years and would be subject to quality control .	-3.0803
" We are very satisfied with the current supplier Chocolat Frey , " said the speaker .	-2.1255
Around 17 million small red and white chuggitans distribute the cabin crew to the passengers at 14 grams per year prior to landing .	-6.9202
The Swiss did not want to specify the cost .	-4.5451
Industry insiders estimate the order volume according to " North-West Switzerland " to 1.5 to 2 million Swiss francs - the Migros subsidiary achieves an annual turnover of around one billion Swiss francs .	-6.2555
But the advertising effect is all the more important : for a chocolate producer it is a prestigious order .	-5.0925
How many applicants there are for the new invitation to tender does not want to betray the Swiss .	-6.2444
However , only Swiss manufacturers are eligible .	-3.0301
According to the newspaper report , Chocolat Frey seeks to renew the treaty beyond spring 2018 .	-3.1687
For the sda , the largest Swiss chocolate manufacturer was not available for an opinion .	-2.6980
Since 2006 , the Swiss have distributed chocolate tables on board their flights .	-2.6350
Before the Swiss signed a contract with Migros ’ s daughter , Barry Callebaut , in collaboration with Hug , had delivered the chocolate tablets .	-4.7825
The possibility to place the logo was introduced by Swiss two and a half years ago with the start of collaboration with Chocolat Frey .	-3.8643
The airline cooperates with various Swiss chocolate producers .	-2.1779
On long-haul flights , First Class customers are spoiled with leckering by Coniserie Sprüngli , Business Class Egyptian passengers Schoggi of Lindt and Chocolat Frey ’ s Economy Class Shoggi .	-5.2391

Nostalgia goes to " Wet Hot American Summer " and " Comrade Detective " to the niche .	-3.6051
This repetition of history is nostalgic at the same time for the glorious days of the characters of the 80s , for the 90-year-old Grunge era ( when the thinker David Wain and Michael Showalter turned the Sketch comedy " The State " for MTV ) , and for themselves - that is , for 2001 , before their stars , such as Elizabeth Banks , Amy Poehler and Paul Rudd went to bigger things .	-5.9475
As a cultural artefact , it is also a parody and a embodiment of our facebook-enabled era of permanent memory .	-3.0499
But as a franchise it feels as though time is running out .	-2.8762
" First Day of Camp " worked surprisingly well , not only because of his absurd humor ( it contained an original story for a speaking can of vegetables , which was spoken by H. Jon Benjamin ) .	-3.7299
By focusing on the core of the gag - middle-aged actors play horny children who will grow up - they still made the impossibility of winning back the last part of the joke .	-7.1976
" Ten Years Later " , with his adults now playing adults , is less emotionally rooted , and his parody goes more according to the principle of greed , including a riff on the 90 's Stalker movies like " The Hand That Rocks the Cradle " ( " The hand the cradle looks " ) .	-7.1829
At one point , a character was knocked through an Apple Powerbook , some inline skates and " a number of other things from 1991 " .	-4.7691
Many central stories are the same .	-1.0263
The loveable Coop ( Mr. Showalter ) , now Roman author , has still not forgotten Katie ( Marguerite Moreau ) .	-3.7513
Victor ( Ken Marino ) still hasn 't lost his virginity .	-3.7987
And there is another crazy malignant plot in which Ronald Reagan ( also Mr. Showalters ) is involved , now supported by George H. W. Bush ( a good good impression of Michael Ian Black ) .	-5.7186
As always , excursions are the best part of the franchise .	-1.1021
It is especially fun to see Mr. Rudd , who is a young ever , who shows Matt Dillons 's signing beard of " Singles " , whose former Big-Man-on-Camp Andy feels like an old hacker .	-8.5311
It is the moments of random madness that this franchise could fuel as a kind of repetitive " Seven Up ! " series until it reaches what I suppose to be his logical conclusion : " Wet Hot American Summer : Twentty Years Later " , whose last scene will show the band how to visit the film premiere of " Wet American Hot Summer " .	-5.2194
" Comrade Detective " on Amazon is now reminiscent of a different kind of nostalgia : the revival of the Cold War of " The Americas " , the film " Atomic Blonde " and even " GLOW " with its Eastern West Ringwar iconography .	-5.1592
The comedies created by Brian Gatewood and Alessandro Tanaka , with Rhys Thomas as director , suggest to be a found TV series : a Romanian drama of the 1980s with the two policemen as friends , two Bucharest officers fighting for truth , Atheism and the way of Marxism-Leninism .	-5.4165
The main roles - a hardcore Gregor and an idealistic Iosef - are played by Florin Piersic Jr. and Corneliu Ulici , whose dialogues are synchronized by Chandering Tatum ( also an executive producer ) and Joseph Gordon Levitt .	-4.7271
It is a brilliant idea .	-0.9847
But it is not much more than an idea .	-1.6110
There are some nice gags to watch ( the police spend time watching TV chess , as Americans may do with football ) .	-5.1099
And the list of famous speakers - including Jenny Slate , Nick Offerman , Mahershala Ali and Chlo<unk> Sevigny - ensures a decent game ' Find the Voice out ' .	-3.5329
But " Comrade Detective " is so committed to the veracity of a desperate propaganda drama - a murderer who wears a Reagan mask - that it often plays like a single .	-3.9733
In six long episodes , the comedy is not fast or often enough .	-3.4759

The message for the imagined Communist audience is that Western culture can make everything feed for a gelage .	-2.8235

Blaming Drugs Mafia in the country	-5.0031
The police hit the Italian mafia in Baden-Württemberg .	-2.6195
On Wednesday morning , numerous objects were searched in the Schwarzwald-Saar district , Rottweil , Konstanz , Esslingen and Stuttgart , as the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office on Friday said .	-5.4895
In doing so , 15 people aged between 25 and 77 were arrested and arrest warrants were issued .	-3.6825
Moreover , officials ensured larger amounts of Marihuana and cocaine , guns and hundreds of thousands of euros .	-3.7617
Two people were arrested in parallel raids in Italy .	-2.4854
There were German arrest warrants against the two suspects .	-1.7717
The two are presumably shipped to Germany .	-2.7921
Italian and Bavarian investigators were involved in the action .	-1.8666
In total , over 300 police officers were in operation .	-2.8987
The members of the Mafia are accused of organised crime , of serious violence , of attempted murder , of robbery and blackmail .	-3.9559
Since summer 2016 , the Public Prosecutor 's Office Konstanz has been investigating organised drug trafficking in southern Germany .	-3.7413
There was a lively exchange between the public prosecutor offices in Konstanz and Palermo and the investigators of the Kripo Rottweil had almost daily contact with their colleagues in Sicily .	-4.7746
Therefore , on Wednesday morning , four officials from Palermo accompanied the action .	-4.5722
In the course of the investigation , Italian citizens in particular , with close contact with the Italian mafia , came to the fore .	-7.0797
Also , an incident on May 27 in Hüfingen , where a few shots were fired in the morning to a restaurant , should go to the band 's account .	-7.8850
Injury in the Auslandsregister	-4.2940
" Data from citizens who should not emerge there " : according to a report , the alien register in Germany suffers significant shortcomings .	-4.9539
This leads to some serious misdecisions on asylum procedures .	-3.5319
According to a media report , the envoy for the Federal Government ’ s refugee management , Frank-Jürgen Kart , drew attention to large gaps in the Central Register .	-6.2782
Deficiencies in the data registered there could lead to ' sometimes serious misdecisions ' in asylum procedures and expulsions , in a way that was in the case of an analysis submitted by the ' Süddeutsche Zeitung ' .	-7.4958
According to the data , 10 million people are registered with foreign nationals , including some 5.7 million from non-EU countries .	-4.6315
The data is therefore managed by about 600 foreign authorities in Germany .	-3.0068
Because the data had not been properly maintained , the data quality in parts had not been good .	-4.4817
Data from 1921 were found in individual cases , " from people who have long since ceased to be alive , or from citizens who have become German citizens and should not appear in the register " .	-5.6379
" Flawed data input can slow return processes considerably " , the report continues to call it " .	-4.5605
Moreover , statistics on people who are subject to travel are statistics that cover EU citizens who do not need to leave .	-5.2130
Such false arrangements , however , ' led to a distorted debate on the handling of remunerated persons ' , so the analysis says .	-6.9825
Meanwhile , the Federal Government has apparently begun sending refugee families with children under 16 to Italy once they have arrived .	-4.1640
This appears in an internal paper by the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees ( BAMF ) , reports the " New Osnabrück Zeitung " .	-3.8563
The paper therefore states that the BAMF is conducting such procedures ' for families with children - with the exception of infants and children - to Italy since 1 June 2017 ' .	-5.7540
Since the end of 2014 , this has virtually been impossible , as the newspaper refers to the difficult situation on the ground .	-4.0325
Under the Dublin Agreement , refugees from the EU state reach first .	-3.9214
If a migrant travels to another EU country , that state may return him to the country of entry .	-3.7561
As for the explanatory statement , the office now reads : " In the meantime , reception capacity for families with minors in Italy has increased substantially " .	-5.6150
Italy has provided guarantees for the reception and accommodation of families .	-3.2605
Even the European Court of Human Rights ( ECHR ) considers these commitments sufficient .	-2.5457
Other EU Member States would also send refugees back to the Dublin Agreement .	-4.4775
The domestic spokeswoman of the left-wing faction in the Bundestag , Ulla Jeppke , criticised this decision : " Families with children are at risk of receiving human rights conditions and endangering children 's welfare because of the shortcomings in the Italian asylum system . "	-6.8701
Two-best results	-5.3625
In total , 220 litres of blood from persons living in Oberreichenbach were already available to other people .	-4.1941
At least the 12 citizens who were awarded on Friday .	-2.0876
Jürgen Greule among others , who has now distributed 50 litres of blood with his 100 donations .	-4.7561
Traditionally , the community at the municipal council meeting recognizes a multiple willingness to donate blood .	-4.4078
" It is ingenious how our body is designed for this and we pay tribute to the donors of respect that make their blood available to strangers , " said Mayor Karlheinz Kistner .	-5.4477
" A single blood donation helps more people , " explained the chief executive of the German Red Cross ( DRK ) , Holger Maisenbacher , for the canned are divided into their components .	-5.7793
Three people could already benefit from blood donations .	-3.0085
At the same time Maisenbacher reported about the actions that will be carried out in Oberreichenbach in spring .	-4.2387
" This year , with 114 donors , we achieved the second best result , " said the DRK head .	-7.3270
Obviously , a few years ago , the change to the Theaterhaus resulted in higher numbers of participants .	-3.7573
Thomas Bockstadt , Susanne Reichle , Sandra Schöck , Thomas Reichle and Meta Umbeer counted among the multiple donors and were awarded for 50 donations .	-5.2491
Half as many of them have Herbert Mair and Dorothee Rieringer , while Tamara Pfrommer , Petra Schleeh , Stefanie Stoll and Uwe Vettter ten times per 500 millilitres of their life taxes .	-5.2449
The Bank of England will keep interest rates at 0.25 %	-1.1216
The Bank of England is likely to announce later that interest rates will remain unchanged , after weak economic growth and the weakening of inflation have reduced speculation about an increase .	-4.5449
The Bank of England warned that economic growth will remain " sluggish " when it maintained interest rates on family incomes in the midst of growing pressure .	-4.3954
The Bank ’ s monetary committee ’ s policymakers ( MPC ) agreed with 6 to 2 to hold interest rates to 0.25 % , with fewer members seeking an increase this month , as weak economic growth weakened support for an increase .	-4.9640
In its quarterly inflation report , the Bank reduced its growth forecasts to 1.7 % for 2017 and 1.6 % for 2018 , warning against continued pressure on household incomes , with inflation expected to rise to just under 3 % in the autumn .	-3.3927
But they signaled that , in the next few years , interest-rate hikes would be needed to rein in the inflation fueled by Brexit , and they said that borrowing costs may have to rise more than expected in financial markets .	-4.5393
The members also voted to withdraw part of the mammoth reform package issued a year after Brexit .	-3.3865
It will call for time for the financing plan to allocate cheaper financial resources to banks from next February , although it has been said that it is now expected to provide GBP 15 billion more under this system - at GBP 115 billion .	-5.1646
minutes after the decision on the interest rate , the Bank said : " In the MPC ’ s central prognosis , GDP remains weak in the short term , as the pressure on the real income of households continues to consume . "	-5.3685
At the interest rates , it repeated that ' a certain streamlining of monetary policy ' would be needed to cool inflation and a ' somewhat larger ' scale than markets would expect .	-4.6072
The markets are currently forecasting the first rise in the third quarter of next year and another in 2020 .	-2.2007
However , the Bank stressed that increases would be " gradual " and " limited " .	-2.3168
The lower adjusted growth forecasts for this and next year are compared to the 1.9 % forecast forecast in May and 1.7 % .	-3.2661
It retained its growth forecast to 1.8 % in 2018 .	-2.1254
According to these news , the pound fell against the dollar and the euro .	-2.7046
The pound fell by 0.5 % to $ 1.31 , and fell by 0.4 % to € 1.11 .	-2.1249
No change will come after the recent disappointing growth figures have reduced rising expectations for an increase in interest rates and GDP has risen from 0.2 % in the second quarter to 0.3 % in the previous three months .	-5.3551
Growth is expected to reach 0.3 % in the third quarter , even though it will easily recover towards the end of the year .	-3.6957
The recent inflation report offered little enthusiasm for households affected by rising inflation and low wage increases , as the tightening will first become even worse before it becomes better .	-5.6379
She added that monetary policy cannot “ prevent ” income decline in the next few years , but she added that wage prices will " significantly " recover at the end of their three-year forecast .	-5.6515
The economy is also strengthened by rising demand for British goods , owing to the weak pound , which will compensate for part of lower consumer spending .	-3.2390
The decision comes one year after the fall in interest rates to 0.25 % last August , following the shocking EU vote that caused the pound to fall .	-3.4395
The Bank estimates that it will probably take four years for prices and business to reach fully .	-2.9513
Before the Bank ’ s last ruling on interest rates , the call for an increase in interest rates had risen , as inflation increased pressure on hard-pressed households , with three policymakers demanding an increase to 0.5 % in July .	-4.3527
Inflation fell from 2.9 % in June last month to 2.6 % , even though the bank said that it was expected to do so and will resume in the coming months .	-4.3716
The Bank said that exceeding the 2 % target is " quite " to the weak pound .	-4.4995
Andrew Montlace , director of Coreco Mortgage Brokers , said : " Given the recent decline in swap rates , the mortgage market is likely to become more competitive again , as lenders are seeking to buy shops and seek a positive end to the year .	-6.8438
The market looks particularly good for those who run out of existing deals and end the new mortgages , and many with free options and low rates are becoming ever more popular . '	-5.2052
NHS ( National Health Service ) is said to prescribe 10,000 people who have been in conflict with HIV .	-5.0893
Patients will receive access to " transformative " HIV prevention treatment from September after a battle before the High Court against funding the NHS drug .	-3.8152
NHS England announced that a pre-sex pre-sex pre-sex pre-exposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) , which may reduce the risk of infection in high-risk patients by around 86 % , is now being provided by the health service with more than a first three-year study for 10,000 people .	-6.7087
He agreed to finance the process after the Supreme Court ’ s judgment last year confirmed that the NHS had the power to pay for the PrEP despite the claim that local authorities should finance it .	-4.9395
The move announced on Thursday was welcomed by NHS England CEO Simon Stevens as ' important new intervention ' , while the National AIDS Trust ( NAT ) called this a ' decisive moment ' .	-4.6778
Sexual health clinics in London , Brighton , Manchester , Liverpool and Sheffield will be among the first to enable people to register , and other clinics will follow in October before it will be introduced across England in April 2018 .	-3.3217
Preexposure prophylaxis ( PrEP ) is a consequence of HIV drugs taken before sex to reduce the risk of HIV infection .	-3.5507
Studies have shown that PrEP significantly reduces HIV transmission in the event of infectious diseases .	-2.3725
Taking PrEP before sexual intercourse means that there are just enough drugs in a person 's body to prevent HIV infection .	-6.2243
These drugs can be taken every day or two hours before sexual intercourse .	-2.6785
Those who are eligible for treatment include gays or bisexual men , transsexuals and individuals with HIV-positive partners who have not been successfully treated .	-3.1776
Clinics identify suitable participants who agree with the study , including men , women , transgenders and individuals who have a partner whose HIV status is not known to be controlled by antiretroviral treatment .	-3.0421
People who live in England and are registered with a family doctor can also register for participation in their local participating sex clinic .	-4.3734
The program will be <unk> 10 million and NHS England signed a contract to supply the medicines this week after international competitive procurement .	-3.8555
The study is intended to assess the full potential of PrEP by collecting clinical evidence , as used , recorded and implemented on a large scale .	-4.1041
Stevens said : " This major new intervention should complement and overtake the far-reaching and increasingly successful efforts to prevent HIV .	-2.6000
It is another milestone in the progress of more than three decades in addressing one of humanity ’ s greatest health challenges . '	-3.9654
Deborah Gold , Chief Executive at NAT ( National Aids Trust ) , said : " This is a crucial moment in the fight against HIV .	-2.1290
PrEP , when it is targeted at vulnerable and vulnerable people , offers the opportunity to change the English HIV epidemic .	-4.2421
From September onwards , people with high HIV risk will have access to this NHS-financed attempt in England to develop a new instrument that is truly individually controlled and not subject to negotiation with a partner , which leads to the improvement of many lives .	-4.3796
We warmly welcome this announcement ' .	-1.5647
Ian Green , CEO of Terence Higgins Trust , said : " The priority now has to be for the study to be conducted quickly across the country , and that no one who has a risk of HIV to be left behind .	-5.1805
Now that PrEP test medicine has been created , we are on the right track to protect more than 10,000 HIV-infected people . '	-3.7127
Sharon Hodgson , shadow health minister , said : " The start of the PrEP process is welcome and overdue after months of delays and slow government implementation .	-3.9315
The evidence shows how transformative this drug can be part of our approach to HIV prevention and an end to the transmission of this life-changing infection .	-2.7941
This attempt will take us a step closer to understanding the benefits of PrEP .	-2.0123
It is now important that this study be carried out as quickly as possible across the country to protect people who are infected with HIV and that it will help us move a step closer to ending the spread of HIV in society ' .	-4.9641
Living big life : Midlevel and clever designer tricks have transformed these little Earls Court apartment into a spacious home .	-3.9961
Joan Leigh , a former banker with a passion for real estate , fell from a large house in Knightsbridge to an Earl 's Court apartment in 2014 .	-3.4747
It is on the first floor of an elegant Queen Anne terrace - and it is proof of the new design that Joanne has not packed and sold her bags .	-2.9016
" Before I lived with my Ex in Knightsbridge in a much larger room " , says Joanne .	-2.4206
" I was looking for something comparable to my price .	-1.3121
I found this apartment in Earls Court and it had the same high ceilings .	-2.1893
I fell in love with her and made an offer on that day ' .	-2.7768
Since the first visit , the 1,000 square feet apartment has been completely overtaken .	-4.6205
Originally a one-room property with a nested layout - one had to go through the kitchen to enter the bedroom - wanted to add Joanne storage space and a mezzanine to make optimal use of the generous ceiling height .	-5.1831
" I wanted high ceilings , large windows , lots of light .	-1.8636
That was my request , ' she says .	-1.8641
To this end , she commissioned the architectural and design studio Duck & Shed by Erfan Azadi from Notting Hill to use the 12.5 feet high ceilings and create a home that was not only a development but also a place for life for Joanne .	-4.1905
The ceiling was not large enough to put two spaces on top , so the architectural challenge was to create an intermediate level in which you could stand .	-4.4295
Erfan had to think creatively to solve the preset .	-1.5611
" The steel work is rather complicated " , he explains .	-2.6678
" We had to arrange the rooms in such a way that they were stacked together without us having to pay off .	-4.4822
It was not just a matter of building a simple platform , but of creating the steel so that it had the right height for the function above or below . '	-6.3023
This arrangement made it possible for Erfan to place two rooms in full - with a lot of additional drama .	-5.1171
For the intermediate level , a classic copper light window of Retrouus looks down over the glamorous living area .	-5.3644
Spectacled gold furniture , silver accents and Vintage Serge Mouille lighting set the style for the program .	-3.2929
The use of mirrors plays a role in adding theatre , space and light .	-2.0907
A short corridor is mirrored at both ends to allow it to work longer .	-3.5813
In the kitchen the mirror feels like a window into another room .	-3.4398
At the entrance , mirrored units can accommodate all the bricknesses and glasses of Joanne .	-4.7871
By perceiving a glamorous room , the beauty of the living room can close the kitchen if it is not used .	-3.0574
Connectable kitchens are nothing new .	-2.7672
The special thing about this is that it is a garage garage .	-2.9944
" A bit of engineering art went in there " , explains Erfan from the steel reinforced veneer MDF door .	-3.3804
" It is weighty , so it is very easy to move when you push the door up . "	-5.9949
Thanks to the clever use of space and storage space , Joanne gained an additional 16 m <unk> , an additional bedroom and an improved layout .	-3.7382
" At the end of the day you will sell the base area - or how your property is valued " , says Erfan .	-3.1050
" In a rudimentary form , a real estate agent will enter and perform a calculation based on the size of the land . "	-3.9526
Here they have been able to enlarge the floor space while using high-quality materials to give the space its luxurious advantage .	-6.1084
" The materials are things that touch you and which therefore help to create an emotional bond in a home , " says Erfan .	-3.7211
" You didn 't fall into the electric power socket on the walls .	-3.3399
These are important , but they do not play with your heart . '	-2.1024
It shows that a flat can be transformed by good design and increased square meters of something standard into something quite amazing .	-4.7611
Indeed , like Joanne , you could decide not to leave it .	-2.2514
Brokers Fight for a $ 500 million Real Estate Imperi	-3.3910
Two brothers are in a struggle four decades after their Italian family founded the dynasty , because of one of the largest property imperial Victoria worth more than $ 500 million .	-5.1290
Former director of the ' Carlton Football Club ' and developer Colin De Lutis lives in a villa in Toorak , just three doors away from his younger brother Paul , who brought him to the Supreme Court to clarify how their property and assets are to be shared .	-5.0568
Paul wanted to withdraw from the family business since 2014 , but a sharp dispute about separation is taking place in the Supreme Court .	-3.9162
Together with her mother Anna , the brothers collected 38 real estate worth more than half a billion dollars , since the family bought a store in Smith Street , Collingwood in 1973 .	-3.4227
There the Westco Jeans family founded a chain of 160 retail stores .	-3.2486
It was sold for USD 85 million in 1999 .	-1.2122
This money has been invested in real estate , and the portfolio of De Lutis now comprises offices in the town centre , Brunswick and Sorrento development areas , the apartments in Gold Coast and Mt Buller and shopping centres in the suburbs .	-5.8201
After an agreement with her late father , Colin - described by Paul as " the main operator and the dominant personality " in the De Lutis family - owns about two-thirds of the company 's assets and Paul a third .	-5.9071
A court act states that this means that Colin owns $ 316 million , and Paul holds $ 176 million .	-3.5258
The division of real estate and cash has proven to be a problem for Paul .	-2.7771
" The divisions proposed by Colin left him with what I thought was the best objects , " he wrote in 2015 in a first Affidavit .	-4.1692
Last Friday , following several failed mediation , the Supreme Court ’ s first hearing took place .	-2.9419
The brothers are now also fighting for control of the existing business - from which Colin , as Paul claims , has ruled him out .	-4.2781
Colin argues that this is not true ; instead , Paul suggests that some ownership is incompetent .	-3.8000
In an early affidavit submitted by Colin , he says he hopes to settle the dispute .	-3.1753
" My Italian heritage prescribes that the family is the most important priority , " he wrote .	-2.1259
The costs rise in the case , with hundreds of sites with Affidavits , e-mails and reports by companies , including Deloitte , Pitcher Partners and Charter Keck Cramer , and with leading lawyers , including Allan Myers , QC , and law firms held by both sides .	-4.2987
Mrs De Lucia and her late husband Luigi were Italian immigrants who operated milk bars and delicatessen from the late 1950s and bought a business in Brunswick in the early 1970s .	-3.7763
They used safety to buy the collingwood property , in which Colin opened the first jeans to the family .	-4.2711
Colin says that he started Westco there when he was " high school in my last years , when Paul was still a small child ( about 10 years old ) . "	-3.5393
Anna De Lutis says that she and Luigi , who died in 2012 , hoped to pass on their property gracefully to their sons .	-4.8518
" Luigi often said to me that he never wanted the brothers to end up in court " , she wrote .	-2.2397
Two other brothers , Mark and Luke , are no longer part of the De Lutis group , with Colin claiming that Mark was paid $ 10 million while leaving the company and Luke $ 26 million .	-3.8455
Both Lukas and Mark , Paul says , " become bitter about the conditions of their financial division " .	-3.6370
Colin was very reticent , although he was a former member of the AFL board of directors and after a 2015 biography by Eddie McGuire the best friend of television stars .	-5.1990
Fairfax Media contacted Colin and Paul De Lutis and their lawyers .	-2.2324
Only Colin replied by SMS to say " I can really not say much " because the case is before the courts .	-3.8501
" It is very , very sad that my brother Paul decided to sue me and draw our family name through the courts " , he wrote .	-2.5689
In mid-2016 , Colin wrote in a letter to the Court that he tried to meet his brother ’ s demands .	-2.6548
" Our father did not want Paul and I to end in our current dispute , " he said and added that he " still hopes for a solution " .	-3.4299
On Friday , that hope seemed past .	-2.3601
" Our affair will be resolved in the near future by the courts , " wrote Colin .	-2.3098
Trump ’ s new chief of staff plans to limit the president ’ s media abstinence .	-2.0944
Others have tried and failed .	-1.3040
Maybe John F. Kelly can do it .	-2.4680
If so , he will be the first .	-0.8989
Politico reports that the White House ’ s new chief of staff is planning to limit the flow of information to President Trump , including news media reports , in the hope of keeping the boss on an equal footing .	-3.7231
Here is a piece of Reporter Josh Dawsey :	-1.5033
" When John F. Kelly , the White House ’ s new chief of staff , met senior staff on his first day of work , he represented a major problem in President Donald Trump ’ s White House that he wanted to repair : poor information that comes into the hands of the president .	-4.8989
Kelly told the staff that information about him should flow - whether on paper or in briefings - because the president would make better decisions if he had good information . "	-4.5277
Kelly ’ s diagnosis makes sense , but others have tried to tame Trump by monitoring his media diet .	-1.8675
President Trump ’ s relationship with television goes back decades – and now that he is in the White House , television advertising is still strong .	-2.9589
" If candidate Trump was annoyed for unfair reporting , it was productive to show him that he received fair coverage for posts that were convincing , " former campaign adviser Sam Nunberg said to Politico in February .	-4.7100
Political Tara Palmeri wrote at the time that " the key to keeping Trump ’ s Twitter habit under control , under six former campaign officials , is to ensure that his personal media use includes a steady praise price . "	-5.3327
Fine .	-1.0741
But the idea that Trump ’ s Twitter habit ever was “ under control ” is ridiculous .	-2.5184
Perhaps these campaign officials know something we do not know to others - that Trump ’ s tweets would have added even more fuel without their interventions .	-3.9199
We will probably never know anything about the tweets that Trump has not sent .	-1.9020
If his employees have managed to keep him out of trouble several times , then their efforts have been worthwhile .	-5.0373
But no one has consistently avoided Trump ’ s controversy .	-4.0502
Part of the problem is that people in a White House , composed of competing parties , always try to advance their own agenda by presenting Trump with material that may promote their views from the world .	-4.5280
Politico - dealing with this story - reported in May about the fondness of advisers to provide dubious information to the president for strategic reasons .	-4.1883
This was an example described by Reporter Shane Goldmacher :	-1.3297
" Current and former Trump officials say that Trump can respond like a volcano to negative press clippings , especially those with corrupt leaks , and that he is bent on finding out where they come from .	-4.5506
This was exactly what happened at the end of February , when someone gave the president a printed copy of an article from GotNews.com , the website of the Internet provocateur Charles C. Johnson , who accused the deputy chief of staff Katie Walsh of " being the source behind a pile of leaks " in the White House .	-5.2227
Although Johnson has been permanently banned from Twitter for harassment , or has offered no concrete evidence , or has in the past made false accusations and revoked them .	-4.3680
Trump read the article and began to ask people about Walsh . "	-2.8071
Goldsmith added that the then chief of staff , Reince Pribus , and the White House Secretary General , Rob Porter , " tried to implement a system to manage and document the paper arm that Trump receives " .	-5.0730
How did it work ?	-1.0654
Kelly is trying to do the same three months later .	-1.9041
Perhaps he will prove himself to be more effective manager than a Pribus , but Trump is still his impulsive self , and his advisers are still seeking influence .	-4.2531
These immutable factors make Kelly 's mission very difficult .	-1.3816
Most sought criminals get Europol post	-3.3645
As the address is unknown , the help of the population is asked and hoped for .	-4.6170
The police all over Europe are sending out postcards this summer to dangerous criminals on the flight . .	-7.6284

Europol reported on Friday of the action following the ' EU Most Wanted ' calendar of winter .	-2.6464
According to Europol , experience has shown that many refugees are hiding in holiday destinations .	-4.3736
21 cards have been put together to deal with the criminals in question from 21 EU countries .	-5.6505

Travelers are negotiating a ditch and are returning to the Millionärseries . are . , , and . ,	-8.1081
Some of the West Midlands ’ most prosperous homeowners are back with some determined travellers on a war leg , who negotiated a tomb drawn by the community to reclaim a field in front of their manor houses .	-7.0786
Travellers have packed their 20 caravans in a field outside a wealthy Solihull street called the " Millionärs Line " .	-5.2484
They brought horses , babies and an army of transporters after they were thrown out in May , without being deterred by a priesthood issued by the Council to prevent their incursions .	-5.2627
The tactful group found a gap in defence equipment and pushed their vehicles through a section that remained unhindered to find a way .	-4.6916
Outlying residents weighed Solihull Council , who said that it was ' useless to deal with the problem ' .	-4.4083
An anonymous resident said : " They went there on Monday evening after being sent by Bentley Heath where they threw stones on the passers-by .	-4.1914
The Council must indeed be forced to implement it by shame because it was useless in dealing with the problem .	-4.1962
Travellers were there in May , moved further and are now back .	-2.3064
More came up yesterday evening , probably more today . '	-3.7770
She added : " The Birmingham Council knows how to deal with it by holding long instructions to protect its parks .	-3.1480
I live on Streetbrook Road and I am not happy to continue paying my community tax if the Council cannot even stop it . '	-2.6424
A local who did not want to be named said : " It is ridiculous , we just saw the last round of these travellers just to be plundered by another round .	-5.1637
The figures have increased this time and you have even seen a horse in the parking area . '	-3.6667
A Speaker of the Solihull Council said : " We are aware of a vacant camp on the land beyond Streetbrook Road and are working with the Soliulls police , and we are taking the necessary legal steps to carry on as soon as possible .	-6.6617
In order to support our collection of evidence , it is very important that as many residents as possible report anti-social or criminal behaviour by calling 101 .	-4.0032
This helps to create a picture of the situation in which the Court must examine when we present our case . '	-3.9752
From Birkenhof becomes Waldhotel Luise .	-1.8632
From the former Hotel Birkenhof the Waldhotel Luise becomes .	-3.4309
The house at Freudenstadt is being renovated and will be reopened on 1 March next year .	-4.5110
That is good news for the city .	-1.7005
After all , with the closure of the Hotel Birkenhof by the then Betriebsgesellschaft mbH on 13 April 2014 , some 30 000 overnight stays per year were lost and also income from the tourist tax .	-5.8592
In the autumn of 2014 , with dramatically rising numbers of refugees coming to the county , the hotel building was offered as a collection accommodation to the Bureau of the Meetings , causing controversial discussions .	-6.1271
The city prevented the accommodation of asylum seekers by setting up a building plan to secure the area as a hotel location .	-4.1554
The decision was not undisputed in the municipal council at that time .	-3.5605
But above all Freudenstadt Oberbürgermeister Julian Osswald defended the hotel location and even then spoke of serious visitors to the house .	-5.1680
He should be right .	-0.5764
Luisenhotels Group with Birgit Scherer , based in Bad Bergzabern , purchased the former Hotel Birkenhof at a voluntary auction in Berlin and wants to make it a house of the 3 star Plus category under the name of Waldhotel Luise .	-10.7896
The group has four houses with the Freudian object .	-2.3743
Two of them in Bad Bergzabern and one in Bad Herrenalb .	-4.5155
They are called Hotel Luise , Luise Park , Parkhotel Luise and now Waldhotel Luise .	-1.6474
The former Hotel Birkenhof has been in front of the entrance for a long time , and when you enter the house you will see the extensive renovation work that has been carried out .	-6.2153
The floors were cut out , blankets partly removed , old bathtubs were removed from the rooms .	-4.8203
The entire hotel building is a single building .	-1.5347
There is still much to be done by March .	-1.6292
" It is actually a nice hotel " , says Thomas Scherer talking to our newspaper .	-2.6449
Everything should be renewed in the Black Forest style .	-2.9524
The rooms are equipped with large walkable showers , the entrance area is redesigned and new windows are built .	-4.6689
Everything should later become " closer to the citizen " , as Thomas Scherer put it .	-4.7247
'We want to make a jewelry item on it ' .	-2.7560
Swimming pool , spa and meeting room are all equipped .	-3.0010
The staff were very friendly and helpful .	-5.4862
The Waldhotel Luise with its 60 rooms wishes to expand , explains Scherer .	-4.1830
Both individual holidaymakers , groups or business people should feel at home in the hotel .	-4.4951
He has already had discussions with OB Julian Osswald and tourist director Michael Krause , says Scherer .	-2.5771
The views of the city are identical to those of the hotel group .	-4.1239
'We are on the same line ' .	-0.9879
Thomas Scherer does not want to be specific about the level of investment .	-3.4472
Nearly under a million euros , he counts .	-3.1645
The outdoor equipment is also put on the front , which is already clearly visible .	-5.3306
A large terrace is created in a courtyard , which will be open from the restaurant , which is public .	-4.5373
Thomas Scherer is optimistic : " Freudenstadt is a good market " .	-1.6363
Russia 's affair : US Special Envoy sets Grand Jury	-4.2261
In the Russia-affair of US President Donald Trump , special counsel Robert Mueller is to have set up a so-called Grand Jury after a report .	-4.0048
The panel started work in recent weeks , wrote the " Wall Street Journal " on appeal to people familiar with the matter .	-4.5613
The newspaper valued the step as a sign that Mueller had extended and intensified his investigations .	-3.1393
The CNN channel reported that there are already first subpoenas of the body in connection with a meeting between Trump ’ s oldest son and a Russian lawyer .	-3.5896
US intelligence agencies have been accusing the Kremlin for a long time of specifically interfering in the 2016 presidential election campaign .	-3.3538
Mueller examines whether there were deals between Trump ’ s campaign and Moscow .	-2.4531
The investigation aims to focus on several men who acted as Republican advisers in the campaign .	-3.6101
According to reports , Mueller also looked more and more at Trump ’ s private and business environment .	-3.0989
The " Washington Post " wrote a few weeks ago that the Special Counsel , Trump , had come to the center of his personal charge , arguing whether the president might have obstructed the judiciary in the course of the affair .	-7.5911
The main task of Grand Jurys is to examine existing evidence in possible criminal cases and to decide whether to prosecute them .	-5.1919
As a result , Grand Jurys are also called anchor .	-3.7315
They are mostly turned on when they are major and controversial cases .	-3.7405
The procedure is always carried out behind closed doors .	-1.5997
The panel can also be used by the Public Prosecutor to invite people to interrogate under oath .	-3.8676
The CNN channel has already issued subpoenas revolving around the meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer .	-3.7681
People who were involved in the meeting were asked to make a statement , it was stated in the report .	-3.5407
They should also provide documents .	-0.9716
Trump ’ s adviser and secretary ’ s son , Jared Kushner , and former campaign leader Paul Manafort , were also involved in the discussion .	-5.2610
Legal experts said on Thursday evening on US television that the announcement that Mueller would not be intimidated in his work and that he would act quickly if necessary .	-5.7676
But it does not necessarily mean that the Grand Jury will be turned on in the end to decide on the collection of a charge .	-5.0752
Nevertheless , setting up the body is the beginning of a new phase in the investigation and a new reason for concern to President Trump .	-4.1487
In the midst of the new revelations , the President took advantage of a speech in West Virginia on Thursday evening to portray the Russian affair as a campaign of his political opponents .	-3.5277
" Russia 's history is a complete invention , " Trump said .	-2.3148
The issue gives the Democrats a way to " feel good , because they have nothing else to talk about . "	-3.5813
His Special Adviser Ty Cobb explained in an opinion that he knew nothing of setting up a Grand Jury .	-3.4011
But they usually work in the secret , he emphasized .	-3.5849
The White House is in favour of any measures that accelerated the work of the Special Leader in a ' fair ' way .	-3.8632
Former FBI chief James Comey said three times that there was no evidence against the president .	-3.9554
There is no reason to believe that this has changed , the statement continued .	-4.3087
But Mueller had only been deployed after Trump fired Comey .	-2.4717
Because of this thunderstorm , accusations against Trump have been raised about wanting to impede justice .	-5.7258
Comey told a Senate committee in June that Trump asked him to stop investigating the then national security adviser , Michael Flynn .	-3.6149
The President is under great pressure because of the inquiry .	-2.1908
After presenting US media , the White House collected material against the Special Counsel and his staff .	-3.7494
This prompted speculation about whether Trump would dismiss Mueller .	-2.7522
Unlike an independent congressional special counsel , such as the Watergate affair of later resigned President Richard Nixon , Mueller has a position in which , in theory , he could be fired by the Ministry of Justice at the insistence of the president .	-5.5376
But several senators of both parties want to prevent such a move .	-3.5515
On Thursday , two groups of Republican and democratic senators presented draft laws that would make the special counsel less easy to dismiss .	-5.8550
Antarctica : Gigantic in Antarctica	-2.4500
In the West Antarctic , a giant iceberg has moved away from the nearly seven times size of Berlin from the Schelfeis .	-4.8861
This was announced by the Bremerhavener Alfred-Wegener Institute for Polar and Marine Research on Wednesday .	-2.8599
The 5800 square kilometres heavy and 5800 square kilometres of pistos are now going north and will probably need two or three years to be melted .	-6.3858
It is one of the biggest ice giants that researchers have registered over the past three decades , at 175 kilometres and a width of up to 50 kilometres .	-6.5082
He does not pose a threat to people .	-2.9446
The extent to which climate change has played a role in breaking the iceberg is unclear , according to research data .	-3.5143
In total , however , there have been a series of unusual collapses in ice sheds in the region for some 30 years , writes the US Research Centre for Snow and Ice ( NSIDC ) in a fact-background .	-6.1118
According to many researchers , this may be related to global warming .	-2.2916
The now canceled colons have been part of the Larsen C-Schelfeis .	-4.4360
Schelfeis lies on the sea and is fed by large glaciers .	-3.6846
As a result , the sea is growing ever further and breaking down regularly .	-5.1965
The Larsen-C-Schelfeis is located south of South America almost at the tip of the Antarctic peninsula .	-4.2597
Northern of this shellwork was disrupted the balance of growth and demolition a few years ago .	-5.7143
A complete shellfeis has collapsed , writes AWI-Freacher Daniela Jansen .	-4.9797
The Larsen C-Schelfeis is in danger too , because the front edge has never withdrawn as far as it is now .	-5.5585
In addition , the ice plate is under tension and may break down if a bit of a key point breaks down .	-5.6704
Melting Schelfeis and Eisberg does not increase sea levels , as they swim on the water and squeeze ice as much water as it does after the melting itself .	-5.0579
However , the loss of the Schelfeis leads to the glaciers reaching the sea directly and leaving much faster than before .	-7.0916
This may increase sea levels , but only slightly , writes the British research project to observe the Antarctic ( Midas ) .	-4.8266
The Larsen C-Schelfeis is , according to AWI data , with almost 50 000 square kilometres , the fourth largest shellfeis in Antarctica .	-5.2867
At the crossing from the mainland it is up to 700 meters thick , on the front edge to the free ocean about 200 meters .	-3.8171
It regularly breaks down there .	-2.7823
" Although it is natural and we are not aware of any direct link to climate change , the Ice Sheet is now in a more vulnerable position , " said Martin O 'Learn of the British Swansea University .	-5.7122
" This is the longest retreat since the records began , " he also confirmed .	-2.9618
Among scientists , it is controversial whether the Larsen C-Schelfeis will grow again or decline in the long term and possibly collapse , his colleague Adrian Luckman said and added : ' Our models say that it will be less stable ' .	-5.7585
But this development will take decades .	-1.9655
Even if these researchers do not bring the collapse of this giant iceberg back to climate change , a great many ice debris in the Antarctic Peninsula has collapsed in recent decades .	-6.6831
This long gate of Antarctica stretches in the direction of South America .	-4.5882
According to data from the British Antarctic Survey , the Antarctic Peninsula ice has fallen by 28 000 square kilometres since the 1950s .	-3.6828
The rise in temperature has contributed to the decline .	-1.8939
In the last 50 years , the Antarctic Peninsula has warmed by about three degrees , making it one of the areas where temperature is the fastest .	-5.1544
CDU wants a Staff Pet	-3.2926
Because it becomes increasingly difficult to fill job vacancies , the CDU is calling for employers to leave the association to become more attractive .	-4.8199
Just before the summer recess , the district day has given way to 41 new administrative posts .	-5.5876
More than 1100 employees and officials work for Mettmann County Management .	-2.5438
Now we have another 17 apprentices after their first working day .	-4.1076
The teaching grounds in the district are obviously very much sought-after .	-4.8468
Some 620 applications were available for the seats to be submitted this year .	-4.1445
However , the group still lacks staff to cope with increased demands and tasks .	-4.5985
At the moment there are still 50 vacant places at Mettmann .	-4.6326
Among other things , doctors and engineers as well as forces of general administration are required .	-3.4676
The CDU now wishes to take the initiative together with the FDP and the UWG at the district day and to oppose the shortage of skilled labour in the administration .	-7.0958
The administration , according to the wishes of the parties , is to ' develop a concept for personnel production and development ' .	-6.0711
The aim is not only to cover short-term needs of professionals , but to counter the shortage of candidates in the future , it is said .	-5.1330
The overall concept should be internally and externally oriented , should show concrete measures for cross-country entrants and include a training offensive , CDU , FDP and UWG are demanding .	-5.9783
This sounds like a good approach .	-1.4237
The circle has to deal with personnel problems that were previously unknown .	-4.8673
Other cities recruit good officials and employees and offer more attractive conditions .	-2.2592
We are talking about a genuine ' competition between public employers ' .	-3.1869
In addition , there are a large number of employees who leave the service due to illness or age .	-7.1486
So it is high time to act so that more jobs do not remain vacant .	-4.7567
But Klaus-Dieter Peoples , the leader of the CDU , goes further than the joint motion with his party .	-7.3907
In the district recently , he delivered a pathetic surprise when he publicly questioned the human resources ceiling and stunted the other parties .	-7.3913
People want to see all the opportunities to leave the community employers ' association reviewed .	-5.1533
" If we do not reach a satisfactory solution in the short term , the management of the circle with the trade unions - perhaps also in cooperation with the associated cities - should aim for a pet trade " , says peoples .	-7.6447
By doing so , the CDU is trying to pay employees and officials better than the public service collective order actually provides for .	-5.6853
The salaries are currently prescribed precisely , increases or more money are only available if you change to a higher level that is based on professional years .	-6.3345
But the circle ’ s tasks have grown more and more in recent years .	-3.0139
Only a few weeks ago , new rooms were created in which employees were concerned about the provisions of the new law on prostitution .	-4.7512
Not least because of the increasing number of asylum seekers , Landrat Thomas Hendele and district director Martin Richter have a problem : they have too few staff .	-4.0874
Italy is tightening the tone of NGO ’ s bailout boats	-3.8950
Italy warned NGOs who use rescue boats for migrants in the Mediterranean that they cannot continue this unless they abide by new rules for their operations .	-4.1680
" If NGOs do not sign a new code of conduct , it is difficult to see how they can continue working , " Minister Marco Minniti said in an interview with the Turin daily La Stampa .	-3.2416
Minnitis ’ s warning came a day after the Italian authorities had seized a boat from the German aid organisation ' Jugend Retet ' , because their team had effectively cooperated with traffickers in a way that facilitated illegal immigration .	-4.7374
The aid organisation , which has only been in operation for a year , refused to comment on detailed accusations of Italian prosecutor Ambrogio Cartosio .	-5.0130
" For us , saving human life is and remains our top priority , so we are very sorry that we cannot operate at the moment in the search and rescue zone , " said the organization in an opinion on the social media .	-4.2405
" We can only judge once we have gathered all the information and can judge the situation . "	-4.7315
The Italian authorities had been monitoring the boat of ' Jugend Retet ' , the Iuventa , since October .	-3.9436
It is suspected that his crew will take snub boat migrants delivered directly to them by human traffickers , and that the smugglers will be able to depart so that ships can be used again .	-6.5030
At least one such meeting was supposed to have only 1.3 miles off the Libyan coast , according to the prosecutor 's file whose content was published by Italian media .	-4.4863
The crew is suspected of defying the authority of the Italian Coast Guard , which monitors rescue operations in the zone for humanitarian reasons and not for any other reason .	-3.9635
Under the code of conduct , boats such as the Iuvena must , above all , have an Italian police officer monitoring their activities .	-4.0451
Only three of the nine NGOs involved in search and rescue operations have so far agreed to abide by the code : Save the Children , MOAS from Malta and Pro-Activa Open Arms from Spain .	-2.8346
The latter said on Thursday that the new rules would be considered unnecessary but acceptable , as they would not involve ' major changes or obstacles ' of their bailouts .	-3.8685
Among those who refuse to sign , the Nobel laureate organization is Doctors Without Borders ( MSF ) .	-2.6978
Minniti has now said that the number of migrants arriving after the bailouts in Italy has fallen sharply in recent weeks , indicating that efforts to strengthen the Libyan coast guard and cooperation with local mayors have borne fruit .	-4.2346
" In the last few days we have begun to see light at the end of the tunnel , " the Minister said .	-2.1452
He announced plans for further talks with Libyan mayors this month on economic development initiatives and with Chad , Niger , and Mali on measures to reduce the number of migrants leaving these countries in the hope of reaching Europe .	-3.1652
Trials and Trials	-2.9941
Nine female bikers , the " Berlin outpost " and two guest drivers met in Wachenheim in the Nordpfalz to enjoy trials and sights for four days .	-4.8081
Three friendly guides were available for this .	-2.1753
Accommodation in the Wachaenheimer Valley proved to be a good starting point for the tours .	-3.0189
The Wachenheim castle and wine festival was a welcome extra .	-2.0734
The first tour led to the Michael Chapel above Deidesheim at hot summer temperatures along the vineyards .	-3.3023
It followed vantage points , partly on towers , from which one could look far beyond the abdomen forest and the surrounding plains .	-7.0629
In between there were longer climbs , for which long trials were rewarded .	-5.4949
The second day went to Bad Dürkheim to Saline and to the Folkfest sausages market .	-3.9336
There was another lookout point at the vantage point , connected by " flowered " trials and moderate climbs .	-7.4470
On the last two days a lot of height meters were fixed .	-4.2086
Caves , rocks , towers , castles , ruins and caves brought welcome breaks .	-2.6992
In Bad Dürkheim the bikers in the outdoor inhalatorium ate healing Sole .	-5.8331
New cities have also been under control .	-3.9647
After 173 kilometres and almost 4500 metres of altitude , the group had met the Pfälzer forest from its best side - sporting and cultural .	-4.2394
Console vs. Grass - Bundesliga equips itself for e-Sport .	-3.0560
Are the sports stars in the future sitting in front of computer consoles instead of being crazy about the stadiums when weather and wind ?	-6.5793
Fact is : e-sports has long since become a serious industry , a lucrative business - big stars , millions of fans and huge tournaments with high Gagen .	-4.5515
The first Bundesliga players , which are increasingly involved in this area , have also recognised this .	-7.3874
The VfL Wolfsburg began in 2015 , then the FC Schalke 04 and most recently the VfB Stuttgart , who founded an e-sports department in mid-July and won two professionals for the computer game FIFA 17 .	-5.7030
" We hope to inspire new young target groups to the VfB , " says Management Board Jochen Röttgermann .	-3.7919
He is sure " that there are several clubs on this train " .	-4.2868
Next weekend , the FIFA World Cup will host the first Interactive Club World Cup in London , where the gamers of different clubs compete against each other .	-4.3769
In addition to Schalke and Wolfsburg , for example , Manchester City , Paris Saint-Germain or PSV Eindhoven qualified .	-2.8342
Robin Dutt also sees great potential in e-sports .	-2.1398
The former coach of Bayer Leverkusen and Werder Bremen now advises an agency for virtual football players .	-2.5780
" Real football in particular has to deal with the 14 to 30 year olds that young people continue to go to the stadium in the future , " says the 52 year old .	-5.7152
And : The clubs tried to conquer all possible markets , especially the Asian ones .	-3.7475
With prominent e-athletes under contract , you could be present on these markets much more online than just once a year to send the Bundesliga to Asia .	-4.2710
What exactly is this about ?	-1.9285
In e-sports , computer games such as " League Of Legends " , " Dota 2 " , " Counter-Strike " , or even FIFA 's soccer simulation are challenged at a competitive level .	-5.8969
For a long time , as in normal sport , leagues have established , where the pros compete against each other .	-4.6176
In the 2022 Asian Games , e-sport is already part of the official programme .	-3.0213
But is it a real sport ?	-2.6506
For many , the idea is certainly needed to get used to .	-3.3661
Ingo Fromale has also been dealing with the question for a long time .	-3.8561
For the professor at the Deutsche Sporthochschule in Cologne , e-sports is a sport because it is competitive and shows many biological and physical reactions that can also be found in classical sport - for example , increased heart frequencies , stress reactions , hormonal changes .	-5.5149
It also needs cognitive skills , a technical and tactical understanding and a fast response capability .	-3.4362
Professional gamers should take care not only of the console but also of their bodies and their diet .	-4.2569
" The fifth player is a good player . "	-2.5052
But Frozen also sees problems : ' doping is becoming an increasing issue ' .	-4.8448
Controls were difficult to implement in online games , and the structures of classical sport lacked the scene .	-4.6545
On the positive side , the scientist emphasises the high integrative effect of e-sport .	-4.4968
The players are on the international road , like a large global family , because there are no intercultural barriers .	-4.6688
A study by Deloitte and the Bundesverband Interactive Entertainment Software ( BIU ) predicts rapid growth in e-sport .	-3.9459
In 2016 , this amounted to EUR 50 million in Germany , mainly through advertising , sponsorship and major tournaments .	-3.7503
Sales are expected to reach 130 million in three years .	-2.5290
That is little against the EUR 2.4 billion in the football Bundesliga .	-4.4874
However , e-sports is " not far from other established sports such as handball , basketball or ice hockey " , the Deloitte consultants write .	-3.9604
Many countries have moved on internationally .	-3.1500
Major markets are Asia and the USA , where ex-basketball players Shaquille O<unk>Neal and Baseballstar Alex Rodriguez participate in the US Team NRG eSports .	-2.9041
Hollywood actor Ashton Kutcher invests in the eSport-betting provider Unikrn .	-2.1073
There is also a lot going on in Europe .	-3.1213
In a Norwegian school , e-sport was introduced as a teaching field , says Fromale .	-3.3842
In the Netherlands and in France , according to Dutt , football first-league clubs are now obliged to set up an e-sports department .	-4.9176
" Germany is lagging behind in European comparison " , explained VfB Executive Board Röttgermann .	-3.1844
It is only in nostalgia that we are falling into play and changing the old times is no longer enough .	-7.1246
The aim is to preserve the tradition of the association , but at the same time to align the company with the modern market .	-4.3792
" We live in a digitized world , " says Dutt .	-2.2841
" It cannot be said that football is the only area where everything remains as it always was . "	-6.0318
Gift Eggs a - The Ego alternatives to Cooking and Backing	-4.2052
Almost all federal states are now affected by the scandal of poisoned eggs .	-2.5793
Aldi Süd and Aldi Nord reacted and removed all eggs from the sale across Germany .	-2.7345
Only eggs should be taken into the shelves , which have not been proven to contain Fipronyl .	-5.8148
Michelle Carter condemned the text that Conrad Roy is pushing for suicide .	-3.4294
A woman from Massachusetts was sentenced to two and a half years for encouraging her friend through texts and calls for suicide .	-3.2262
Michelle Carter , now 20 , will spend 15 months of her conviction behind bars and five years have been exposed to probity .	-3.2268
Carter was convicted in June for negligent killing of Conrad Roy , who died on 13 July 2014 .	-3.3810
The father of Roy said on Thursday at the hearing : " My family is uncomforting .	-2.8306
My son was my best friend . '	-1.0962
Carter was allowed to remain free to appeal .	-2.7441
She was confronted with a maximum sentence of 20 years , but her legal representative argued that both she and Mrs Roy were suffering from mental illness .	-3.4125
Carter was dressed in red trousers and a creamy blouse , standing in the eyes with tears , with folded hands and downwards facing eyes when she was sentenced .	-5.6614
" Their actions killed Conrad Roy , " the prosecutors said to the court .	-2.4172
" She ended his life to make her own better .	-1.8932
She did not accept responsibility , " she said .	-3.4636
" She has shown no remorse " .	-2.7074
But Carter 's lawyer said that it is a ' terrible circumstance that they are completely sorry ' .	-4.9893
Judge Lawrence Moniz , however , said that he did not find that their " age or maturity or even their mental illness have a significant impact on their actions " .	-3.5787
A prosecutor read a statement by Roy 's mother Lynn Roy , who said that there was " no day at which I did not account for the loss of my beloved son .	-4.4213
I would like him to be proud of me and as I did with everything , and I try to be there for his sisters , despite all the pains that we will wear with us for eternity .	-10.1468
Roy 's sister , Camdyn Roy , said that she would be " persecuted " from the realization that she would never participate in the wedding of her brother or be a treat for his children .	-4.8042
" Not having this only person with whom I have been together every day since my birth is a pain I will always keep with me for the rest of my life , " she said .	-3.4643
The case seems to set a legal precedent because there is no law in Massachusetts that makes it a crime to ask another to commit suicide .	-2.5262
Carter was 17 years old when Roy was found dead in 2014 from a carbon monoxide poisoning in a vehicle .	-1.7445
The case attracted national attention after Carter ’ s announcement of a text message that encouraged him to end his life .	-4.8424
" Look up , jump from a building , create yourself , I do not know there are many ways , " she said in several news that she had sent in the two weeks before his death while he was on holiday with his family .	-7.8086
In the moments before his suicide , they wrote : " You must do it , Conrad " and " Everything you need to do is turn on the generator and you will be free and happy " .	-6.4739
Judge Moniz said that Carter sought attention by the death of Roy and ordered that they should benefit from the case through any press .	-3.5608
The case has divided legal opinion .	-2.1558
One of the few who defended Carter was Amanda Knox , who was convicted in 2007 for murder of her British co-resident in Italy before she was released two years ago .	-4.1220
Mrs Knox , 30 years old , published a comment in Los Angeles Times : ' Michelle Carter deserves compassion and help , not imprisonment ' .	-3.0887

The FC Bayern trusts the Coned-Cup Winner a big season - no extra motivation is harmed .	-6.0407
Somewhat was different in his place in the cabin , the Joshua Kimmich saw immediately , even though the extra dress was very , very small .	-5.4308
But since the second day of the Audi Cup was not , of course , Philipp Lahm and not Manuel Neuer , he made the tie tie to his arm .	-6.2704
" The coach did not announce it , " the Conked Cup winner told him afterwards , after his first assignment as a Bavarian captain .	-6.3184
Well , the entity could have run better than at 0 : 2 against the SSC Naples .	-3.5466
But the Coach character could also interpret Kimmich .	-2.4331
Not the eight years older Arturo Vidal had been chosen as a leader in the C-Elf , which was made up of young players , debutants and just from the holiday .	-8.3876
Sugar is most likely to be distributed to those who want to be trusted .	-4.9918
So anyone who has learned to rise to the legacy of Lahm can only use a little extra motivation .	-5.8105
Kimmich confirmed : " This is what you want as a player : take responsibility " .	-4.1230
On Wednesday , the 22-year-old flipped over the field as a mini-worm .	-4.5712
To the right behind , this is now his position , the white tie on the arm did the rest .	-4.2181
And Kimmich actually worked in this starting formation like the one that can best take control of the Rudder .	-5.6697
He gave instructions , tried to control the unplayed force .	-3.1680
He had a look for the whole while many others were busy with themselves .	-4.6807
As Vidal had to overplay his lack of fitness , Renato Sanches would go out on devils with the performances of the Asian journey ( note that this was limited ) ; and Sebastian Rudy and Niklas Süle would not be negatively affected in their first appearance in the Bayern-Trikot .	-11.8893
That , after all , was a good thing .	-4.1492
After the war , the two were forced to leave the country .	-11.3165
The notorious Napoli storm often hit hard , and Süle also tried to succeed a few times in the game building .	-7.9363
His colleague , Mr Rudy , admitted that the result ' was not the way we hoped for ' .	-4.1620
But he also showed a decent performance at the debut .	-2.9032
Lookback , Tempowechsel : " I was taken for this style .	-5.6206
The unknown world of Bayern is still for the new entrants .	-6.8121
For example , Rudy gave not one or two interviews in the catacombs , but determined six or seven .	-2.6840
After a few brief statements , Kimmich left his new fellow players .	-4.9506
There he heard an interesting sentence from Süle : " What is going on here , I have already noticed .	-5.5080
At Bayern you simply have to win any game " .	-3.9760
After all , he will no longer have to teach the new .	-4.8145
Alba motivates <unk>FB ladies	-2.3094
David Alba believes in the success of our <unk>FB ladies	-2.1012
Austria ’ s most famous footballer just before the game has been reported on Twitter and the <unk>FB Ladies wanted all the best .	-6.5460
After all , the Bavarian Legionary is almost a club member of <unk>FB Kapitalien Schnaderbeck and is equipped with our ladys .	-7.0768
The Tweet of the Austrian footballer of the year and the Champion League winner should be a special injection of motivation .	-4.4751
Perhaps our ladies could need the famous Bayern Dusel .	-3.4545
Enterprises satisfied with the Rhineland-Palatinate Minister : Economy lobes Wissen ’ s Tempo	-6.9759
It often defrauded itself , the relationship between the country and the regional economy , when Eveline Lemke ( Greens ) was still minister of economics at Rhineland-Palatinate .	-4.6937
This is evident after more than a year in which the new Minister for Economic Affairs , Volker Wissing ( FDP ) , is in office .	-4.0496
Chambers and companies from the region speak of a change in economic policy at T V 's request - and at the same time , the old minister .	-5.8923
Frank Natus , Chairman of the Association of Trierer Companies ( VTU ) , says : " Wishing attacks the wishes of the economy , which has all blocked Lemke " .	-4.4013
NATO ’ s biggest U-turn is infrastructure policy : the motorway 1 between Kelberg and Adenau is now at the top of the country ’ s list of priorities . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-7.4522
Even this year , the Ministry hopes to have a planning system , until 2021 construction law will stand .	-6.7550
The Western Strike Trier , which is the primary demand of the Federal Traffic Roadmap , also plays a role in the country ’ s plans .	-8.9995
The aim is to start the route in December 2020 , says Minister Cornelia Holtmann .	-3.7009
Natus sees it as a signpost to support regional but internationally competitive companies .	-2.8595
The Chamber of Commerce and Industry ( IHK ) Trier , as suggested by Wishing , seeks a Rhineland-Palatinate label to increase sales in supermarkets and to stop the trend of German wine exports , which have been falling for ten years .	-5.6631
Furthermore , Wishing has an open ear for people who want to set up their own company , praises the IHK .	-4.2550
The Trier Chamber of Craft sees in the new master ’ s onus an additional incentive for young apprentices , says Managing Director Matthias Schwalbach .	-4.7341
A prize of € 1000 for the completed master exam and € 2500 is envisaged if graduates within ten years of master education become self-employed .	-7.3837
But the country ’ s house levies list remains long .	-4.5645
In the planned construction of the roads , it is fast to create facts , while at the same time it lacks the necessary staff , says Jan Glockauer , Chief Executive of the IHK Trier .	-7.0958
Of the 56 new engineers who want to set up mobility at the local plant , only 29 posts have been filled .	-6.6144
The IHK calls for more contracts to be awarded to external offices .	-2.5978
CDU group vize Christian Baldauf refers to calculations by the Court of Auditors that , in 2017 and 2018 , more than EUR 20 million have been invested in maintaining land roads than proposed .	-5.7575
Frank Natus also expects a concept of the country to resolve the shortage of skilled workers in the region .	-4.6877
What is more , broadband in the country has been sobering .	-4.9333
In 2016 , regional companies only rated net supply in an IHK survey with the grade 3.4 .	-4.3852
They complained about faltering Internet connections and breakdowns .	-3.4349
Former economic minister Eveline Lemke , on the other hand , is currently out of politics and is still in the supervisory board of the wind power company Pro Wind .	-4.8209
The Green Group left Lemke in April to become President of a private university in Karlsruhe - where , after four months of discord , they already closed the field again .	-4.4493
Audi is expected to change 850,000 diesel cars - automakers face a backlash .	-3.1732
One day before Audi announced , BMW said that it would offer to upgrade the software to more than 350,000 vehicles .	-2.9742
The BMW chairman said that the company considered that ' there are smarter options than driving restrictions ' , thus referring to European cities - including Munich , where BMW is based - banning or restricting diesel cars .	-5.4600
Daimler announced on Tuesday that there will be three million Mercedes vehicles in Europe to modify their diesel emissions .	-2.9033
None of the companies described the undertakings as calling back .	-2.9519
European car manufacturers have strongly encouraged the use of diesel vehicles in Europe and the United States to support compliance with carbon emissions rules .	-3.2791
But the nitrogen oxides emitting diesel engines are considered carcinogens and can cause asthma .	-2.8064
The cost to car manufacturers to install equipment to neutralise the exhaust gases emitted by diesel vehicles is also increasing , which makes it difficult to keep the price of cars competitive .	-4.2720
German Chancellor Angela Merkel is also accused of having the powerful car companies and ignoring the evidence of the problem .	-3.3576
The companies are trying to avoid the mistakes of Volkswagen , which could regulate the use of so-called terminal equipment , in order to comply with the rules when a car has been tested , but are driving back under normal conditions .	-7.1511
In the United States , several Volkswagen employees have been charged , others are being investigated on both sides of the Atlantic .	-2.6418
Last month , the former head of thermodynamics in the engine development of Audi in Germany was arrested .	-2.4346
The former manager , Zacchio Giovanni Pamio , is Italian and is therefore not protected from extradition and could be tried in the United States .	-3.3271
At the beginning of this year Audi was involved in German criminal investigations at Volkswagen , after the Audi authorities accused of having installed a system to circumvent emission regulations in Europe , and a request focused on the United States has been extended .	-5.2301
The inclusion of Audi in the study could be a heavy burden for Volkswagen : the luxury car manufacturer contributes disproportionately to Volkswagen ’ s profit .	-5.0704
This message has the rafting on Saturday at the Isar	-4.2452
The city intends to protect the Isar .	-2.5315
In order for the Isar visitors to join , tomorrow Saturday there will be a flight through Munich , which has a special message .	-6.5066
On Saturday , if you prefer the Isar again , you will see a big rafting between Flaucher and Reichenbachbrücke .	-7.0895
And this is not a nasty floss , with Isar tourists .	-4.2585
Special the construction reference will clarify .	-3.2475
On the river you can see a big Infotransparent .	-4.5463
It shows a rubbish dump .	-2.0188
The opening of a public campaign to appeal to the Isar visitors .	-3.3534
With the motto " True Love is ... " the understanding of the Isar as a protective flow should increase .	-5.0442
Last summer , the River River River over the River Isar and this year , too , there are further actions and measures to achieve a respectful and environmentally conscious behaviour .	-8.6752
Mordillo Knoll and Lack on suffering	-3.4107
Mordillo was sometimes one of the most published cartoons , the Knoll titles of his characters are his trademark .	-4.3801
Even with 85 , the Argentines still draw and works on a film .	-3.9595
His message : laughs , ' because there is too much suffering in the world ' .	-1.8946
Guillermo Mordillo was born on August 4 , 1932 as the son of Spanish immigrants in Buenos Aires .	-1.8495
In his first years as an artist , he beat himself , among other things , as a draftsman for greeting cards - which made him frustrated .	-5.2406
" The happiest day in my professional life was the day when lost in my job , " he once said .	-2.0025
After graduating from Lima , New York and Paris , he achieved his breakthrough in the late 1960s : with the publication of his cartoons in " Paris Match " and then in the " Stern " and other leading magazines around the world .	-5.0196
Even in China , Mordillo found many fans .	-1.5786
Again and again , the artist drew inspiration from cities .	-3.1758
Large , rounded Mordillo figures rub in drawings with the Tower of Pisa , Big Ben in London and the Red Square in Moscow .	-4.3347
In the early morning , according to his own data , he is still in the drawing table today , working almost ten hours a day .	-4.4924
Through calendars , puzzles , books for young and old , T-shirts , pills and watches , his drolly figures continue to be spread all over the world .	-6.8870
For six years he has also worked on a carton film and a TV series with his figures .	-4.4382
The main person in the film " Crazy Island " is a Giraffe - Mordillos 's favourite animal in his drawings - which has a thousand foot opponent .	-4.9528
His figures speak for the first time in 3D film , which is to come to the cinema wall in 2019 .	-3.5220
" I do not know exactly what they will say , it is strange for me , " says Mordillo .	-2.0705
The script is not written by him .	-1.5371
This is why he is focusing more on the TV series , which , like his original drawings , is produced without word .	-5.9249
Lavender from Provence threatened with climate change	-3.5734
It has become a symbol of Provence in southern France , but there is a warning that it is threatened with climate change .	-2.5012
Lavender is falling because of the conditions reminiscent of drought and because of the insects carrying out diseases , which causes major headaches for scientists and farmers trying to find solutions .	-5.9603
Eric Chaisse , an expert on agricultural research institute CRIEPPAM in Provence , said : " The lavender in Provence is effectively threatened because in recent years the plant has been exposed to the effects of climate change , which caused much less rain in spring and much more in autumn .	-5.2847
This affects the life of lavender .	-1.8692
There is also a small cicade , a microbaker that transfers Dwarves and , in very dry weather , there are many of them . '	-4.7087
And there is a lot at stake .	-1.3084
Lavender oil does not only attract tourists , it is also very much in demand for perfumes and cosmetics .	-3.8218
Eric Chaisse said : " Instead of having very long vegetable oaks with a large number of flowers , we have smaller , under-developed and either missing or weakened .	-3.1541
So we have fewer parts with essential oil . '	-2.1601
The solutions considered include better water distribution and a reduction in soil evaporation , but also plant spray with a protective mixture of clay and water and the development of varieties that are more resistant to drying .	-4.9567
The town of Geisa in the Thuringian Rhön celebrates its 1200-year existence .	-6.1141
The peak is this Saturday and Sunday with an age-old festival .	-6.0573
Crafts , breezes , traders , vagants or a country cladding are to be experienced in the city centre these days .	-7.8284
The murder of a journalist highlights the growing threat in Mexico	-1.5026
The Riodoce weekly staff usually meet on Wednesdays to review their plans to report on the recent chaos in Sinaloa by organised crime , corrupt officials , and ceaseless drug wars .	-5.5689
But on that day , under the shadow of their own tragedy , they came together to talk about security .	-3.8315
They were told that it is important to change their routines .	-2.1633
Two high-level journalists discuss what feels safer : they should take their children to the office , who were the target of an attack with grenades in 2009 , or leave them at home .	-4.4953
Security experts have written three words on a panel at the front of the room : opponents , neutrals , allies .	-1.8834
You ask reporters to propose names for each column - no proof is necessary , perceptions and building feelings rich .	-4.3799
There are drug traffickers , politicians , businessmen , journalists suspected of being on the payroll of the government or cartels , a catalogue of criminals who make Mexico 's chaos dangerous .	-3.8419
There is no respite from the violence , and while the bodies are accumulating throughout the country , there are increasing journalists : at least 25 years since President Enrique Pena Nieto took office in December 2012 .	-13.5303
Among the latter is her editor and inspiration from Riodoce , the co-founder , Javier Valdez Cardenas .	-3.9690
" The biggest mistake is to live in Mexico and be a journalist , " he wrote in one of his many books about violence in connection with drugs .	-3.6512
His absence is deeply felt , although his presence is everywhere - a large photo of Valdez showing his mid-finger with the word " Justice " hangs on the facade of the Riodoce building .	-5.8385
The workshop takes place less than two months after its death , and the reporters discuss their divided topics , the trauma , their nightmares , sleeplessness , paranoia .	-3.2308
Although a special federal lawyer was established in 2010 to deal with the cases of journalists , the Committee on the Protection of Journalists only initiated two criminal proceedings .	-5.1593
As with most thousands of murders linked to drug trafficking and organised crime every year , journalists ' murderers are rarely tried .	-3.1514
At Riodoce , they still insist on treating Sinaloa ’ s violence , although they are immortal , and even though the terrain is still more treacherous .	-5.2627
Without information on the murderers , without justice , the meeting to discuss security has little benefit , says Ibarra .	-3.0054
" It is very stupid to waste my time in this workshop , " he says .	-1.4348
" As long as we do not know the Why , we all trust . "	-3.5251
On the morning of May 15 , Valdez left the office of the newspaper Riodoce in the provincial capital of Culiacan .	-3.9225
He was forced to drive a few blocks far before his red Toyota Corolla was stopped by two men , and was shot on him 12 times , probably because of the name of the newspaper - which is translated by " twelfth river " .	-9.6658
The shooter drove away in his car and damaged it nearby .	-2.3516
Valdez was 50 years old .	-1.4232
He left a woman and two adult children .	-1.0846
Rumors tend to cheat freely in Culiacan .	-3.2090
But , on the subject of Valdez , there is virtually nothing but silence .	-2.6041
Since Guzman ’ s arrest last year and extradition to the United States in January , Sinaloa has become one of the country ’ s bloodiest battlefields , as rival factions are fighting here to fill the vacuum .	-2.8133
It does not matter that in Sinaloa every day someone or more people are shot on the streets in Sinaloa , or that the cemetery is full of decorated , two-story mausoleums for drug kings , which are larger than many houses for the living .	-6.4623
Forget for a minute that there is a state of " calm " when only one cartel has control over the coastal state with its valuable ports and drug trade routes to the United States .	-4.3054
Despite this , and despite the fact that Valdez was aware of the dangers of his work , Ismail Bojorquez ( 60 ) , a co-founder and director of Riodoce , is broken to blame for not being able to protect his friend .	-4.0463
He believes that two misunderstandings have contributed to the murder .	-1.2891
First , in February , there was the publication of an interview with Damaso Lopez , a leader of one of the rival cartel factions in the war with Guzman ’ s sons .	-3.1204
This publication may have angered the sons , gang members suspected bought each copy of the edition as soon as it was delivered to newspaper kiosks .	-5.8196
The second mistake was not to force Valdez to leave the country for his own security following the seizure of another newspaper that had published the same story .	-3.8650
Valdez was a legend in Mexico and abroad , and his killing is seen as a milestone in Mexican violence against journalists .	-2.4847
He had survived for so long that his friends and colleagues assumed he would always be there .	-2.5193
He worked as an experienced reporter for Noroeste in 2003 when he joined five colleagues to set up Riodoce and sold $ 50 .	-4.6605
In Sinaloa , " it was impossible to operate journalism without getting into the drug problem , " said Bojorquez .	-2.5034
Over time , the newspaper deserved a reputation for its bold and honest reporting and sales and advertising .	-4.5988
Reporters loved publishing hard performing studies without fear of censorship , and readers were fascinated by a publication in which they could read stories that no one else could treat .	-4.2982
Eight years after the founding of Riodoce , she received the prestigious " Maria-Moors-Cabot Prize " for her coverage in Latin America .	-3.5307
In the same year , Valdez won the International Press Freedom Award from the Committee for the Protection of Journalists for his courage in pursuing the Mexican drug history , wherever she led .	-4.0425
He voluntarily admitted that he was afraid .	-1.6629
" I want to continue living " , he said at the time of the CPJ award .	-2.3379
drug trafficking in Sinaloa " is a way of life " , he said last October in an interview with Romeveanto TV .	-3.3151
" You must take on the task that falls to you as a journalist - either that or you play the flames .	-3.9700
I do not want to be asked : ' What did you do in the face of so many death ... why did you not say what was going on ? '	-4.0146
The Ridoce team miss Valdez , the Spa<unk>vogel , who could flood like a port worker , the friend who was generous with hugs and advice , a teacher who knew how to survive .	-6.2167
They trusted their routine .	-1.3285
He would always pay his hat .	-1.1906
He would always go to El Guayabo , the bar opposite the office , and always sit at the same table .	-2.4633
Now they ask : Was his love of routine be deceiving ?	-2.4224
His death has also forced them to question their own assumptions about how best to do their work while remaining alive .	-3.6832
" You don 't like it if you are dealing with their women , their children , their clean shops , their home runways to move drugs .	-4.4324
" These things were not allowed , " said Bojorquez .	-1.4446
The result , even in the best times , is a high degree of self-censorship and self-preservation .	-2.2563
Trust his own instincts .	-2.0840
If it smacks of error , it will stay away .	-2.8401
The anger is , the editor of Riodoce Andres Villarrreal said that " smell a sense that can be deceived ... and then the thing happened to Javier " .	-6.4458
The old rules , as he and others say , no longer apply in Sinaloa , just as in Tamaulipas , Veracruz , Guerrero , and other states , where a poisonous mix of lucrative smuggling routes , weak institutions , and corrupt government officials is home .	-4.2645
The landscape is changing constantly .	-1.8111
In the space where Riodoce ’ s employees met for security training , no mobile phones were suddenly allowed , and days before it became known that spyware sold exclusively to governments was used to monitor journalists and activists in Mexico .	-5.9116
Two policemen sought protection from the heat of 104 degrees ( 40 <unk> C ) in the shade of a tree .	-2.3947
They were mandated by the government of the state to protect the offices of Riodoce in a four-story building in a middle class district of Culiacan .	-5.6520
Halfway in joke , some of the reporters wondered whether these officers were among the 50 % of the police officers that the governor himself described as untrusted .	-5.2865
It has been months since the reporters entered the mountain landscape , where drug gangs are de facto under control .	-3.3250
For this week ’ s edition , Riodoce has written three major stories .	-4.6748
There was the murder of the brother of former well known boxer Julio Cesar Chavez in Sinaloa .	-8.1872
They also had an Exposé on government spending , which focused on the Governor ’ s home town .	-3.6726
And there was a group that employed a kidnapping in one of the most expensive restaurants in Culiacan , one block from the Public Prosecutor 's office .	-3.8732
There was no official word about who was kidnapped or what happened , so caution when it was time to write what everyone in the city knows : that the restaurant is a favourite local of drug dealers and authorities .	-4.6185
A reporter learned from public records that the restaurant was registered under the name of a politician belonging to the governing Institutional Revolution Party ( PRI ) , which dominated almost the entire century all political levels .	-4.3639
Recently , several PRI governors were accused of corruption for high-profile cases .	-1.9001
Villarreal asked the reporter to write about previous incidents in this restaurant , including one in which a son of " El Chapo " Guzman escaped a military attack .	-3.6078
Only a few months before , readers would have considered the column of Valdez as the most informed source of abduction .	-4.4575
" We used to know what happened , " said Villarreal , 46 , with the nickname " El Flaco " because of its slim body stature .	-3.1911
" Now all channels of communication with our sources have broken down . "	-2.2866
The Valdez office has been converted into a storage space for signs and labels protesting against the murder of journalists , because the staff have become something they would never have expected : activists in the name of the press .	-5.0705
Reporter Miriam Ramirez grabbed a few characters and went to a demonstration the next morning for another journalist on the Public Prosecutor 's office .	-4.3847
Salvador Adame disappeared three days after Valdez was killed , in the western state of Michoacan .	-2.4055
A burned body has been discovered and officials say , based on DNA testing that it is his .	-5.3013
Journalists have grown louder throughout the country by writing in organized protests " SOS Press " on footpaths and buildings .	-4.1939
On that day , the director Bojorquez is away in Washington and is trying to gain international support for the judiciary in the case of Valdez .	-4.2293
At a meeting with the governor of Sinaloa the day after the assassination of Valdez , Ramirez accused the authorities of spying journalists and letting them move because they told the truth .	-4.0912
She has since asked for her to be re-elected by the government because she is worried that her anger has violated her objectivity .	-4.1343
Valdez repeatedly said that journalists in Mexico were ' surrounded ' by organised crime , government officials involved and an equal society .	-4.3999
In his last book , " Narco Journalism " , he wrote that reporters are not only killed by drug gangs , but also on orders by politicians and security forces who were under a blanket with organised crime .	-4.4049
The articulo 19 media guard group allocated more than half of the attacks on journalists to the police and officials last year .	-3.3041
" In Mexico you pardon because they want you to keep your mouth , " said Ramirez .	-3.4355
Obviously , the killings have a deterrent effect .	-1.8194
No one forgets the death of the blogger Maria Elizabeth Macias in the northern border state of Tamaulipas six years ago .	-1.9575
Your body was found along with a note allegedly signed by the Zetas-Kartel : " I am here for my reports " .	-4.0931
A computer keyboard and headphones were attached to their separated head .	-3.1686
Some branches have chosen to close , as the El Norte newspaper in the northern state of Chihuahua after the murder of the correspondent Miroslava Breach in March .	-3.1045
Others continue , as El Manana of Nuevo Laredo did after the assassination of her director in 2004 .	-2.1181
In 2010 , the Diario de Ciudad Juarez publicly addressed the drug cartel with an editorial on the title page entitled " What do you want from us ? " .	-4.8670
Some journalists have fled their own countries , or even their country .	-2.5573
It is a painful decision .	-0.6067
It is hard to find work in exile , and they are still watching the streets and looking for dangers .	-4.6256
And sometimes they are chased , as seems to the photographer Ruben Espinosa , who , in 2015 , together with four women in an apartment in Mexico City , was murdered three months after the flight from Veracruz .	-4.3319
For those who stay behind and continue work , it is a daily dance with risky decisions .	-3.1457
Ibarra , who once wanted to be a poet , admits that drug trafficking scares him .	-2.4797
" Mexico goes to hell , so I became a reporter , " he said .	-2.6691
At midnight last Friday , when the last issue had already ended , the editors of Riodoce sat in front of the office and drank beer when all their phones started to summon .	-6.0451
A number of raids with gang rivals and security forces near the Mazatlan seaside resort had left 19 confirmed dead .	-4.0598
The war continued to escalate , as promised by a number of antitrust messages in the region .	-3.4511
From the border you have posted the news on the website of Ridoce via mobile .	-5.2905
The title page had to be changed the next day .	-1.4768
Sirens were nearby - another shooting in the area .	-3.8478
Bojorquez looked at the policemen who kept guard to see if they were prepared .	-2.7547
If they were afraid , they did not .	-3.0237
Riodoce ’ s staff were following his footsteps under the massive portrait of the fallen founder of the newspaper , whose central finger was visible to the whole of Sinaloa .	-6.7885
" How can you only think about closing , " said Bojorquez , " when , on the same day as Javier was murdered , the practitioner asked me to put her on the street to report . "	-6.5011
Dinosaurs used a camouflage to soften his enemies .	-3.0943
At first glance , it looks like a statue , albeit a frightening one .	-2.4154
Now researchers have found that the first findings of a Canadian miner ’ s incredible Nashorns were so well received that experts described it as “ Mona Lisa of dinosaurs . ”	-4.5065
It was so good that they even found out that his glowing skin of Roman brown was - and they said it had something of a " troubled past " .	-6.1228
The report in the magazine " Current Biology " called it " the best-preserved parked dinosaur ever found and one of the best dinosaurs in the world " .	-4.2856
The Fossil is a newly discovered kind of Nodosian living in the middle of the Cretaceous period between 110 million and 112 million years ago .	-4.5771
Its incredibly good state has stunned researchers who describe it as " truly remarkable " .	-3.5171
According to reports in National Geographic , the parsed herbivorous is the most preserved fossil of its kind .	-3.4541
It was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 in the Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.4032
He met for something that seemed misplaced by the surrounding rock and decided to look more closely .	-3.7697
The Fossil , which he discovered , was sent to the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Pale.	-2.6995
They spent the next six years trying to uncover the wild animal within the <unk> 2,500 ( 1,100 kg ) heavy ground fleet .	-5.7106
After all this hard work , the finished result is ready to be revealed .	-3.3637
" If you blink a little with your eyes , you might almost believe it has killed , " said the main author Caleb Brown , scientist in the Royal Tyrrell Museum , where the creature is to be seen .	-5.3046
" It will enter the history of science as one of the most beautiful and best-preserved Dinosaur specimens - the Mona Lisa of the Dinosaurrium . "	-3.5758
Researchers have found that , although it is covered with an armour and resembles a changing tank , this herbivorous dinosaurs was probably threatened by meat .	-5.4646
The heavily parked dinosaur used a red and white camouflage to hide from predatory animals , and used a shielding technique known as counter-attestation used by many modern animals .	-5.1145
This would have allowed him to mix better with his enemies , say experts , which suggests that it was threatened by larger dinosaurs .	-5.7028
The 110m old creature from the family of the Nodosaurier made the headlines for the first time in May and is now on display in the Royal Tyrrell Museum of Paleontology .	-7.8323
Researchers have now studied the wild animal and called it Borealopelta markmitchelli after the Museum Technician Mark Mitchell , one of a team who spent more than 7,000 hours covering it carefully .	-4.8743
The astonishing preservation of the copy allowed Dr. Mitchell and an international team of scientists to document the pattern and shape of scales and armor over his body .	-3.9501
They discovered the contour violation , a common defense method in the animal kingdom , which means that the top of the creature was darker than their underside .	-5.3688
Although the contour is common , the results are surprising , since the size of Borealopelta far exceeds that of today 's animals .	-5.0029
It suggests that the dinosaur was driven by enough pressure from but-eating dinosaurs , that evolution encouraged confrontation as a means of survival .	-4.4900
But most contemporary animals that use the contour hunting - think of roe , zebra , or belt animals - are much smaller and more vulnerable than loot , signaling that this Nodosaurier was subjected to a real battle for survival .	-7.4583
" Great predatory behaviour on a massive dinosaur , very patched , shows how dangerous the dinosaur predators of the Cretaceous period must have been , " said Brown .	-5.8645
The chemical analysis of organic compounds in their scales also shows that the skin of dinosaur was reddish .	-2.1621
Scientists continue to study the animal on notes about his life , including his conserved intestinal content , to find out what it had eaten as his last meal .	-4.5495
They believe that when the dinosaur died , the dinosaur was driven to a river , where he sank on his back to the sea bed .	-5.0021
At that time , Alberta was as warm as South Florida today , and rivers and oceans probably spread much further inland than they are today .	-3.4578
" This nodoplant is really remarkable because it is fully covered with conservative , but also preserved in three dimensions and retains the original form of animal , " said Brown .	-6.5342
" The result is that the animal looks almost the same today as in the early Cretan period .	-3.3999
You do not need to use much imagination to reconstruct it , and if you just play with your eyes , you might almost believe that it is sleeping . '	-6.2221
The Cretaceous period was a time when huge theropods , carnivorous Dinosaur , which stood on two legs , went through the earth .	-5.8390
Although the king of them , the tyrannosaurus Rex , lived millions of years after Borealopelta , the armored dinosaur was hunted by some of his terrifying ancestors .	-3.8690
This includes the acrocosaurus , a 38 foot ( 11.5 m ) long , six tons of heavy monsters .	-4.5209
The scientists whose latest findings appear in the current Biology journal believe that Borealopelta was sank after death in the sea and was mummified in the mud .	-4.1380
The creature was found by Shawn Funk when he grub on March 21 , 2011 at Suncor Millenium Mine near Fort McMurray in the north of Alberta , Canada .	-3.7034
According to the museum it is the best preserved parked dinosaur in the world , including skin and armor , and is completely from the nose to the hip .	-4.6891
On average , creatures were about 18 feet ( 5 metres ) long and weighed up to <unk> 3,000 ( 1,300 kg ) .	-3.3581
It contained two 20-inch long tips coming from his shoulders .	-2.6051
The researchers believe that the patched plant fresser was blown through Western Canada until a flood of river flooded it into the open sea .	-5.5555
But the water vapour of the dinosaur kept its armor in exquisite detail .	-2.8664
The hidden remains of this special specimen are preserved so well that the remains of the skin still hold wooden panels along the dinosaur .	-4.3468
As Michael Greshko has written for National Geographic , such a conservation level is rare as a lottery profit .	-3.2707
The more I look at it , the more confusing it becomes .	-1.4523
Hidden remains of the skin still cover the bumpy tank plates that carry the animal 's skull .	-5.7480
Its right front foot is on its side , its five fingers are stretched upwards .	-5.5322
I can count the scales at his sole ' .	-2.1083
In a thunderstorm : mass caramalgia to A8 : Many injured	-6.8225
Heavy accident on Thursday evening at the A8 : Knapp 30 vehicles are involved in a mass carambolage .	-3.8644
There are many injuries , many kilometres of dust and gaffer .	-4.4123
At Stuttgart-Munich ( A8 ) motorway , about 20 people were injured on a mass caramole on the late Thursday afternoon .	-4.0746
According to the first data from the police , under a thunderstorm under 30 vehicles , including trucks , were fitted in between the connecting sites of Adelzhausen and Odelzhausen ( Aichach-Friedberg district ) during a thunderstorm .	-8.7777
The exact number of injured persons was initially not reported .	-4.2665
It was a case of minor injuries to the middle , said a spokesman for the police .	-5.6790
A large supply of rescue vehicles was at the point of the accident .	-3.5127
The A8 was completely locked in the direction of Munich .	-1.9939
In Munich ’ s direction , the backlog was about ten kilometres long .	-4.9917
As reported by an AZ reporter , there was also massive obstruction on the opposite track - through numerous gaffer .	-5.7637
The fire brigade noted the characteristics of the vehicle drivers , who now face sensitive penalties .	-4.8856
A second accident on the A8 took place shortly after 6 : 45 , this time between Augsburg and Dasing .	-2.7311
A collision between a passenger and a passenger car had ensued .	-4.0587
A rescue helicopter was on the way to the site .	-3.3013
Deutsche Bahn : Group tests ' comfort check-in '	-3.2663
It is a moment that almost everyone has already experienced : nobody can watch the train and sleep .	-6.1509
Or one is deeper into his work and has just a brilliant idea .	-3.3368
And then : pufff .	-1.2874
Stop the creative and wake up an impractical or mature passenger in the middle of the workflow .	-7.3000
Card control .	-1.4310
But the times of interruptions are about to come .	-3.9566
Deutsche Bahn is currently testing the unsecured ticket control system .	-3.9465
You simply confirm by mobile that you take your seat and thus devalue the ticket .	-4.7510
A test operation currently runs on two tracks .	-2.7017
" Get the offer , we expand it .	-4.0461
It will probably be available at the beginning of next year on many other long-distance routes in Germany , " said a train spokesman .	-4.2990
" Check-in comfort " means the train can be evaluated without any Schaffner .	-6.4715
In order to be able to use them , however , a few conditions need to be met : you need a smartphone or tablet .	-5.0376
And you have to have booked an online ticket - which most of the passengers already do .	-4.5401
You also have to buy it via the App of the train , which is the most convenient way of booking your ticket .	-5.5455
And last but not least , you need a seat reservation .	-2.3319
Because the " Check-in comfort " works so : you climb to the train , you call your ticket under " My Tickets " .	-7.1161
A button for electronic validation will be displayed for the test customers .	-8.6477
The train accompanying gets a message on their mobile devices that passenger X is in the train and has occupied the booked seat Y .	-4.9178
If the train attendant is in the seat Y when the ticket is checked , he knows that there is a passenger with an online ticket that has already been validated .	-6.3281
You can sleep further , work further , keep quiet .	-3.7910
The " check-in " has two advantages : one for the customer , one for the train - which in turn should be used for the passenger .	-4.3991
" If you want to travel by our train crew without a ticket control , just check in the DB Navigator .	-5.5376
This allows passengers to personalise their travel time on the train " , says Michael Peterson , marketing board of DB long-distance transport .	-4.6696
Second plus : " And our employees have more time than today to respond to individual customer needs " .	-3.7188
Those who often drive the train know that , besides delays and passing trains , the ticket controls are one of the biggest problems .	-7.0665
Because it is often you have yourself , but in any case one of the fellow travellers does not have all the documents you need to validate online .	-6.8199
Either the credit card or identity card is missing or a document must be provided .	-5.2191
As a result , there are endless discussions between train crews and passengers , which leads to a bad mood in the abdominal or large room and delays in controlling your own ticket and ultimately takes time for the creative person to take care of other concerns .	-8.3459
Only a small number of test customers can use the new service .	-2.1119
And this also applies only to the ICE 915 Dortmund-Clouds and ICE 912 Stuttgart-Essen connections .	-5.3296
Further train numbers on the same route are not yet available .	-3.4259
How an activist came to learn the answer to the question : " Who Streets ? "	-3.1666
On 9 August 2014 , Britany Ferrell was shaken to its core .	-1.8049
Only one day after she arrived in New York City , the in St. Louis Geborene sat on the bed of an Airbnn apartment she mized and scrolled through Facebook on her phone .	-5.1016
She stumbled over a post from someone in High School .	-2.1687
" The police have just killed an 18-year-old child , and it is still on the street , " they said .	-3.1919
Created because nobody else posted the information on their feed , they closed Facebook and opened Twitter .	-3.3777
A user with the handle <unk> TheePharoah was constantly retreated on her timeline .	-3.6220
The Rapper from the territory of St. Louis was killed live on the death of Michael Brown , an unarmed black 18-year-old who was killed by a white policeman in Ferguson , Mo .	-3.8982
He revealed a picture of browsing lifeless body that was stretched out on the street and would remain there four hours .	-4.9086
" That is wild , " Ferrell thought .	-4.4642
But death was nothing new for them and their community .	-1.6372
She abandoned her cell phone to return to tweets about people on the Canfield-Drive later in the evening .	-3.6913
There were photos of the police band and people who wrote , and of a man who claimed to be Brown 's father , who was a sign with the inscription : " Ferguson 's police just killed my unarmed son ! "	-7.7718
She observed a live feed where a policeman stood in front of a group of demonstrators with a belligerent dog .	-2.8932
In another video , she said , another policeman escaped his gun and wrote : " I will kill you ... animals all " .	-2.8603
" This is not customary " , Ferrell reminded herself of her statement .	-3.8647
" This is not the kind of murder we have used to and that we can typically call . "	-3.7033
At this moment I felt frost .	-3.0381
I was angry and fervent . '	-2.3630
She booked a return flight and went home the next day .	-1.2338
After landing at 23 : 00 she took her 6-year-old daughter out of her father ’ s house and decided that the two would drive to Ferguson the next morning .	-4.4677
What happened to Ferrell and Ferguson in the following three years is the theme of a new documentary , " Who Streets ? " , in cinemas from 11 .	-3.4525
It is a history of survival and protest , love and loss , strength and resistance that exists from the point of view of people living in the Community and filled the streets to demand answers .	-4.4851
When Ferrell drove to Ferguson with her daughter , who wore a flower dress and a fitting crown , the two called a conversation , which they had countless times before this morning » about the black experience and the black condition <unk> .	-5.0251
" You remember how I taught you when black people have to to believe in ? , the of what she said . the of . , .	-7.7147
" We are now going to Ferguson because the police killed an 18-year-old boy and that was not right .	-3.0075
I could not take them with you , " said Ferrell later .	-2.6951
" What happened today is a highlight of what happened in the past .	-2.5457
It needs to know it , to see it and to be raised in it .	-4.3646
It must be well developed , not only activism and organization , but also the various strata of black experience and the black constitution , and what we must do to become free to liberate ourselves .	-4.2137
Although I have the good fortune to give her an experience in which she personally does not experience blatant racism , she is no different from the next black female child .	-4.7885
I have the feeling that I would be doing her a disservice to keep her from doing so . '	-3.5018
The first station , when they arrived in Ferguson , was located on South Florissant Road , a place opposite the police authority that became a camp when activists waited for the possible non-prosecution of officer Darren Wilson .	-6.6213
Ferrell and her daughter were associated with a local businessman who made lunch .	-4.2486
They prepared bags and helped to pass them on to demonstrators .	-1.8755
Slowly , a new kind of activism for Ferrell began to take shape .	-1.7375
" My activism has changed completely after August 9 , " she said and noticed that she was a student at the University of Missouri St . Louis President of the Minority Student Nurses Association and focused on food justice and health inequalities in black communities .	-4.1869
" I had no experience in organizing .	-2.1494
Everything has come . '	-2.3084
Weeks later Ferrell met during an evening demonstration Sabaah Folayan , one of the co-directors of the film .	-2.4497
Folayan said she and her cameraman Lucas Alvarado-Farrar just wanted to " document " what happened .	-2.8978
A question came into the sense of Ferrell : " Do you want to document or try to find a story you can use ? "	-4.2974
This skepticism was nourished by countless human cases , often by whites - in a community that benefited from its pain and resilience .	-4.0469
As Folayan said recently in an interview , ' We had heard that people born and raised in Ferguson did not support their votes and we wanted to do it differently ' .	-4.5295
Folayan had already worked with then-co-director Damon Davis , an artist from the field known for his activism rum around death row passengers .	-5.0691
His commitment brought Ferrell closer to the project , together with six other locals , followed the team of " Who Streets ? " in the years after Brown 's shooting .	-4.2411
" This documentary is not someone who speaks for us or speaks with us .	-2.3192
" That was the main thing for me , how these people are represented , because that is how I will be represented . "	-4.7424
The aim was not to focus on Ferrell 's experience - to show that the movement " is not a messiah leader , but a community that comes together " , said Folayan - it proved to be the most open participating in the film .	-4.8109
As a result , documents of " Who Streets ? " depict surprisingly personal aspects of Ferrell 's life as they fall in love and marry her wife .	-3.7165
" I felt like naked , " said Ferrell and laughed when she saw the finished product for the first time .	-1.8195
" But I understand that there must be some vulnerability in this work and in the enhancement of black people . "	-3.9665
In addition , Ferrell ’ s history repeats the role of black gay women in the broader black-live Matter movement .	-3.0479
Two of the three founders of the movement , who after killing the black teenager Trayvon Martin in 2012 marked the film " BlacklipensMatter " in social media , identify themselves as gay .	-4.3186
" Black , gay women in managerial positions have carried the movement as a whole , " said Ferrell , " and therefore we are constantly fighting on different fronts .	-4.6274
Schwarze , gay women have to bear the brunt of everything . '	-4.1878
Folayan agreed to notice that " the movement really is maintained by black women and many black women " .	-2.6949
However , it insists that " this is not an affective type of action " where Ferrell was selected as the heart of the film because of her identity .	-4.3281
" She was the person who stirred up this energy , " she said .	-1.8678
" It is no coincidence , although she was on the front line because in a life on these crossings is so much at stake as a black , gay woman .	-4.3024
You can feel their energy through the screen " .	-2.2396
Meanwhile , the news cameras in Ferguson have long since disappeared , but the racist connections between the community and the police continue .	-3.8116
Ferrell is on probation for 2 <unk> years because of the blocking of a motorway during a demonstration .	-2.9863
It describes the area 's social atmosphere , which it calls its home : " A Chaos " .	-3.5737
Nevertheless , she clings to a song and she feels committed to this memory since she took the streets three years ago in Ferguson .	-5.4614
" It is our duty to fight for our freedom .	-0.7315
It is our duty to win .	-1.1112
We must love and support each other .	-1.2348
We have nothing to lose except our chains ' .	-2.1158
From " dream " to " megalomania " : TV readers discuss Bit Gallery .	-4.1787
The bit gallery is moving people , even though it is not yet built .	-2.9596
But the idea of a shopping centre on the south end of the pedestrian zone since the first presentation in 2009 split the population into supporters and opponents .	-3.9387
Cold leaves the subject hardly one .	-3.0357
The topic is also discussed on our Facebook page " Volksfreunde Bitburg " .	-3.3272
While some say to the bit gallery : " That would be a dream " ( Anja Becker ) or " That would be real class " ( Nicole Schasten ) , comes from the other side : " Do no man " ( Siggi Betzen ) or quite simply : " megalomania ! " ( Lars Scholz ) .	-5.8419
While supporters are building a gallery that attracts more clients , which also benefits the other businesses , opponents fear that the pedestrian zone will blew out .	-7.5209
In addition , the gallery is planned on the premises where the farmers ' market hall , where 13 direct marketing companies offer their products .	-5.7578
This will stop when construction works are started .	-3.9245
The Galerie-makers want to integrate a market hall into the new building - to the Beda Square with possibility to sit outside .	-6.2341
Simone Zimmer : " We have been buying in the farming market for many years almost weekly .	-3.9793
Mainly our eggs , but also the delicious cakes of the peasant people are always very happy .	-4.1353
We also discovered the butchery for us .	-2.2638
We would like to see an opportunity to maintain this offer during and , above all , after the construction of the gallery .	-4.9593
In other cities , that is also true .	-3.5936
The Kleinmarkhalle in Frankfurt is especially interesting . '	-3.5065
Gerd Densing : " Whether direct marketing is located in a market hall in the gallery , the rent is up to the amount .	-5.0216
However , this should not be very low in the new project ' .	-3.8066
Eva Kilic : " Why Shopping Palace in Bitburg ?	-2.1874
Whether clothing , shoes , drug products or supermarkets , I find this superfluous .	-3.7455
There is enough of that in our city .	-2.7049
You can see how many shops are empty here - some for months and years .	-3.1170
However , as there is not even a proper weekly market here , it is all the more important that we at least retain the market hall .	-3.8859
After all , the goods offered there are fresh , are mostly offered directly by the producer and are also cheap .	-5.4434
As you can see , shops in a shopping center are only registered by larger companies , because the hire there is often not acceptable to a retailer .	-6.4919
Too bad , special deals almost no longer exist and what remains of them will probably disappear ' .	-5.4942
Wolf Fandel : " A shopping mall with a market hall does not fit me together .	-2.0760
And the gallery does not fit to Bitburg .	-1.5572
First of all , where should the farming market hall go during construction ?	-4.1443
The old Edeka would be the solution - even in the long term , if the bit-gallery comes into effect at some point .	-4.3657
Or does the specter Bit Gallery manage to distribute all stores from Bitburg ? "	-5.1748
George Marquet : " This will simply not work .	-1.7985
And a shopping centre that is empty does not need anyone .	-2.7592
In my view , it would have been better to promote a proper farming market , rather than this gallery .	-3.7364
However , thanks to the insane number of - I think - pointless construction projects in Bitburg , it is no longer possible for a farming market .	-6.4200
If the farming market hall is broken , a piece of culture will disappear again ' .	-3.7594
A fitting similarity : She creates portraits with Chelsea Manning DNA .	-2.5580
In the middle of the space of the Fridman Gallery in New York there are many faces to see - white , black and brown , which are almost unimaginable - hanging on cables on the ceiling .	-4.3759
The 30 portraits were created by the artist Heber Dewey-Hagborg , who was sent to her by Chelsea Manning .	-3.4503
Manning sent the excerpts from Fort Leavenworth , where the former intelligence analyst was serving a 35-year sentence after disclosing classified diplomatic messages on the WikiLeaks website .	-4.1577
The new exhibition opened on August 2nd is called A Eucoming Assembly ( A matching similarity ) .	-4.3448
It is the product of two years of correspondence between Dewey-Hagborg , whose discipline brought together their expertise in technology , computer science and art , and Manning , a transcript and groundbreaking dissident , whose condemnation was transformed by Barack Obama when he had only three days in his office .	-8.4039
Dewey-Hagborg , through the algorithmic analysis of DNA extracted from Manning , created from the 30 portraits of how someone could look like these genomic data , has created a sharp , though some intellectual comment not only about the formability of DNA data - the many ways they can be interpreted and the inherent determinism of these interpretations - but also about identity .	-5.5124
Manning , born as Bradley Edward , but has been openly talking about identification as a woman since her puberty , was convicted in 2013 for 20 indictments , including six violations of the espionage law , computer fraud , and theft .	-4.7302
Through the prison her image was repressed so much that there was only one photograph - a grained , black and white Selfie , in which Manning clearly sits on a driver 's seat and carries a platine wig - with which it was associated .	-6.5660
In 2015 , Dewey-Hagborg came just from the great success of her 2012-project Stranger Visions .	-3.1373
In it , the artist produced portraits of strangers from forensic artifacts such as cigar jam and chewing gum by extracting DNA from the waste to produce a picture of what these people might look like .	-5.5040
This was when she received an email from a newspaper magazine .	-2.4314
" She conducted an interview with Chelsea Manning while she was in prison , and she wanted a kind of portrait to accompany this article , " said Dewey-Hagborg in a press preview of the new exhibition .	-3.8388
And she could not be visited at this time and she could not be photographed , so contact Chelsea and asked her if she wanted to make a DNA portrait .	-3.8670
The artist and her imprisoned Muse became unequally friendly letters , which exchanged several letters over the course of two years .	-5.3656
They even created a comic " Suppressed Images " , illustrated by Shoili Kanungo , which foresaw a future in which President Chelsea 's judgment would be transformed and she would be able to see the exhibition personally .	-4.9393
Indeed , just a few days after the book was published , Obama would demand Manning ’ s release after seven brutal years in a military prison in Kansas , was a welcome kind of happy meeting .	-3.9268
There is also something low and strong at the opening of the exhibition , as Donald Trump is waging a war against whistle-blowers from the government camp and from Transgender-troops to find new , tweetable ways to further dismantle the rigid divisions that he should actually correct .	-7.4365
When Dewey-Hagborg was asked about the strange timing of all these things , she said that " things happen for a certain reason " .	-2.3807
In an artistic statement written on the wall of the gallery , Manning called for an end to " automatic fragmentation , the basis of which was gender , race , sexuality and culture " with its overwhelming . "	-12.4364
On the opposite wall is their mitochondrial DNA sequence - a thousandth of the Cs and Gs and As written in pencil .	-5.0384
Dewey-Hagborg hoped to show by incorporating the 200 letters ( or nucleotides according to the advanced scientific glossary of the artist ) as surprisingly similar , at least in biological terms , we are all .	-4.5194
" What people will hopefully take away from it is that our genome does not care about who we are and how open genetic data for an interpretation and how subjective they are , " said Dewey-Hagborg , whose video work of 2007 , Spourious Memories , can also be seen .	-4.9697
" DNA data can tell so many different stories , so these are 30 of these stories . "	-2.3039
The last piece in the exhibition , which is kept in its own room , is a page from the above-mentioned comic novel .	-4.6284
She shows Manning how she appears in the hands of a telephone number from the disciplinary coffers of the United States like King Kong .	-6.7082
" If they scale your speech , then they have won , " it is said .	-4.4309
'So never keep your mouth ' .	-2.8472
" It came directly from a letter she wrote to me , " said the artist who greet Philadelphia .	-3.0060
" I am still getting goose when I talk about it . "	-5.0556
Manning has not yet seen the exhibition personally - just as it was anticipated in the comic book - but if it should do so , it will be welcomed in the middle of the space by the masks , by their own genomic simulars , which merge like hordes of protesters .	-6.4241
This was also targeted , like everything in the exhibition , up to the size ( 5 " 2 , Manning stature ) , in which their genetic haplines were written with pencil .	-6.2538
" In the past I had her on the wall , but I wanted her to feel like a crowd , " said Devuy-Hagborg of portraits .	-3.5660
" I wanted it to feel like a mass movement that formed with Chelsea , like the movement that was also behind its liberation . "	-3.5829
Professor of Northwestern University and an employee of Oxford for killing .	-3.5856
A national hunt for human beings is underway for a professor at Northwestern University and an employee at Oxford University , who are sought as suspects after a man was shot in a luxurious apartment in Chicago with fatal injuries .	-5.9088
On Monday , Wyndham Lathem ( 42 ) and Andrew Warren ( 56 ) were issued on charges of murder for their alleged participation in the death of Trenton H. James Cornell Duranleau , as shown by the files of the court of office of Cook County .	-4.9077
The documents say that Cornell Duranleau , 26 , died after several tricks .	-2.8221
A Community warning system published by the Chicago police authority states that the body was discovered on 27 July .	-2.8360
Officials received a call , arrived at the Grand Plaza Apartments and found the victim with several injuries to his body .	-2.4262
Cornell Duranleau was still declared dead in the place of the event , and detectives investigate the stitches as murder , while the police are actively seeking the two suspects , officials said .	-5.2350
Since 2007 , Lathem has been an extraordinary professor of microbiology and immunology at Northwestern University .	-2.7709
Alan K. Cubbage , vice president of university relations , said in an email statement that Lathem is now in attested and has been excluded from entering the campus of Northwestern University .	-5.5269
" This is now a criminal matter investigated by the competent authorities , and Northwestern University is cooperating with this investigation , " said Cubbage .	-3.8093
Warren was a senior treasury assistant at Oxford University .	-2.8694
A spokesman from the University and Somerville College said in an email statement that ' we are in contact with the police in Britain and are prepared to help the US investigation authorities in every way possible ' .	-4.3930
The statement added that Warren ’ s colleagues were shocked and want him to stand .	-2.9384
Chief Communications Officer of the Chicago Police Authority , Anthony Guglielmi , said he strongly urge the suspects to face up to the authorities .	-3.0931
" The police have an idea of their whereabouts , and our efforts to locate them intensify , " said Guglielmi .	-2.8751
Guglielmi said that local , regional and national authorities are helping to find the suspects .	-1.7261
Guglielmi said that the police received a call from the building manager of the Grand-Plaza building , who had just received a enigmatic tip saying that something happened in apartment 1008 .	-3.9111
The police described the scene as very cruel .	-0.6209
Guglielmi said that it is unclear whether the incident also took place on 27 July .	-2.9390
Safety cameras confirm that Latem and Warren were in the building .	-2.4348
" We believe that Professor Latham and the victim had a relationship , " said Guglielmi .	-1.8670
The management team at Grand Plaza published a statement to the residents : " The police are working on the timeline and the victim 's background and researching a variety of motives , including a possible domestic event . "	-4.2725
" We will close the WADA roadmap in the near future " - the Russian Deputy Prime Minister Mutko	-3.5041
The Russian Deputy Prime Minister Vital Mutko said that it will not take long to implement the remaining criteria of the World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) for the restoration of the Russian anti-doping agency ( RUSADA ) .	-4.1641
" At a certain stage of meeting the criteria of the road map , RUADA has been granted the right to plan and test in cooperation with UKAD ( UK Anti-Doping ) .	-4.0506
The WADA roadmap has been updated in this regard , " said Mutko on Thursday .	-3.3584
The PM commented on the second part of the WADA roadmap for compliance with the code that describes the criteria for the restoration of RUSHADA and was published recently on the organization 's website .	-4.7832
According to Mutko , it contains nothing that could give Russia cause for concern .	-3.2126
" Everything was announced , everything is implemented .	-2.0402
And the results will be presented to the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the WADA in the near future , " he added .	-1.8554
However , one of the criteria mentioned in the list states that the Russian anti-doping authorities must publicly accept the reported results of the investigation approved by the WADA by Canadian lawyer Richard McLaren on alleged state-sponsored doping in Russian sport .	-3.8779
As regards the matter , Mutko said : ' We are conducting the investigation because our anti-doping system has made a mistake .	-4.0831
All measures have been implemented .	-3.6616
But there were no government programmes and we will not admit something that does not exist . '	-3.3655
Mutko ’ s words were in line with those of Vitaly Smirnov , the head of the independent Russian anti-doping Commission .	-3.0690
In talks with the Russian sales agency RSport at the beginning of the day , Smirnov admitted past problems in Russian anti-doping organisations , but then added : " We have repeatedly said that the report contains controversial positions and regulations .	-4.4217
No one wants to accept this report unconditionally , " Smirnov added .	-3.8937
RUSADA was ruled out by the WADA in November 2015 as a result of the doping scandal by Russia .	-5.8910
However , it was allowed to plan and coordinate tests under the supervision of international experts and the UK anti-doping ( UKAD ) .	-2.1553
After a visit to Moscow 's headquarters in July , WADA Director-General Olivier Niggli explained that RUSHADA moves " in the right direction " to be reinstated .	-4.7697
Aldi is no longer selling eggs for the time being .	-3.0185
That was shared by the business groups .	-2.9518
It was a mere precaution that no health impairments could be made any further , as stated in the communication .	-5.7740
From now on only eggs should be delivered to Aldi , which have been proven to have been tested negatively on fipronilcontaining antiparasites .	-6.8411
Aldi wants to establish clarity and transparency among its customers .	-3.4485
The Start-Up that will help your company not to become the next Uber .	-3.4669
Amy Potratt wanted to measure happiness in your online shop start-up , but the polls did not work .	-5.4958
Answers have often been vague , unhelpful , or , worse , fraudulent .	-3.3709
And even if you promised anonymity , some workers did not trust the process .	-1.5430
" There was simply never consistency and objectivity , " said Erratt , who runs the 75-person San Francisco e-Commerce Hair Care Society Madison Reed .	-3.7390
She called people from outside for help .	-1.8085
A new breed of human resources startups is growing to help companies find out how their employees feel .	-2.8216
By creating and licensing software that has the specific purpose of measuring employee engagement , it allows companies to conduct surveys , to address specific groups and demographic groups , to provide employees anonymity and complaints hotlines , and in some cases Whistleblowern allows to bypass the C-Suite executives and contact the board directly .	-6.0356
" You now have tools such as Strava and Fitbit for tracking your health , but where is the Fitbit for your company ? " said Jim Barnett , co-founder and Chief Executive of Redwood City Start-up Glint , whose software analytics tools are used by companies to measure employee engagement .	-4.0820
Savitt said that she gained a better insight into what your employees think and feel in the three years with Glint .	-3.7716
In addition to the Snap surveys and surveys of certain teams , it offers a heat-card from the company that shows at a glance which units have the most complaints and which executives have low ratings - so that you can check why .	-6.3976
Companies come to see that they must remain at the top of job culture , so that you are not the next user involved in scandals since a former employee published a blog post describing an environment of harassment in which those who have spoken have been punished .	-5.1006
For starters like Glint , this desire for an overview is a lucrative business opportunity .	-3.3147
Global governance , regulation , and compliance could hold more than $ 118.7 billion in 2020 , according to the Financial Web site Let 's Talk Payments .	-3.5725
Denver , Colorado , Start-up Convercent , which helps companies prevent and recognize bad behavior , saw an increasing interest and activity at the beginning of this year in discredits in the midst of the Uber-Fall .	-5.6813
Convercent has almost 600 clients , including Airbnb , Microsoft and Tesla .	-1.4634
Uber has recently registered as a client .	-1.6475
Like Glint , Convercent lets companies send tailored " pulse " surveys , collect confidential responses in real time and view the heat types of your problem areas .	-4.2310
It also provides an anonymous SMS hotline that allows employees to report bad behavior .	-2.9240
And if the Chief Executive is involved , complaints go directly to the Supervisory Board .	-3.0768
" The court of public opinion has captured the regulators , " said Patrick Quinlan , the founder and director of Convercent .	-3.3581
When a company is found that treats its employees badly or behaves unethical , it can experience costly consequences from consumer boycott , employee turnover , and complaints , Quilan said .	-5.8945
Ruby Tuesday , the restaurant chain with more than 25,000 employees and more than 500 sites , has used Convercenter for more than a year to ensure that employees are aware of politics and procedures and have a simple way to reach their corporate headquarters .	-4.5904
Previously , when an employee wanted to report a problem , he or she had to find a telephone number or email for the corporate headquarters , submit a formal complaint and hope that it was taken seriously .	-4.0882
It was often a form of intimidation and inconvenient experience , James Vitrano , Ruby Tuesdays General Counsel , said that there was no good way to follow the complaints of employees .	-4.2319
Now that the company uses Convercent , problems previously hidden by executives who sat in offices in cities or countries can be identified and addressed more quickly , such as discrimination , harassment or dishonest practices .	-4.4576
" I can approach this holistic , 360-degree view to the experience of employment , " said Vitrano , who leads the risk management group of Ruby Tuesday .	-4.3248
" And we protect our shareholders against employment disputes . "	-5.1462
Companies began to take ethics , values , and employee engagement more seriously in 2002 , after the accounting corporation Arthur Andersen collapsed due to ethical infringements by the Enron scandal , Quinlan said .	-4.7439
But it took until the " social media came to their right " that companies realised that they could not prevent their dirty laundry going online .	-3.8092
" Before using technology to monitor ethics , people used hope as a strategy , " he said .	-1.4702
Both Glint and Convercent offer your software as a service , and place a burden on companies with recurring charges for using their products .	-3.9195
It is a business model and an opportunity that finds the approval of Venture Capital investors who supported both start-ups .	-2.9178
Convercent received $ 10 million in financing in February from companies like Sapphire Ventures and Tola Capital , raising the total capital to $ 47 million .	-2.7880
Glitzers secured $ 10 million in November by Beschhofer Venture Partners , bringing its total funding to $ 60 million .	-4.1369
These investments hardly come as a surprise , given the interconnected nature of companies , culture and venture capital .	-2.5712
There is a growing research complex that shows that today ’ s employees expect more from their jobs than they have done to date .	-4.2376
In competitive markets like Silicon Valley , high salaries and interesting projects are only stakes .	-2.3759
The employees want to feel that you are accepted and appreciated and that you give your time to a company with a positive mission .	-3.1294
" If people are happy to be in a company , feel their voices heard , and that the work you do is worthwhile , then they feel more committed to making this company successful , " said Nina McQueen , Vice President of Global Benefit and Employee Experience at LinkedIn , which uses both Convercent and Glint .	-4.4415
Investors achieve returns when their portfolio companies run well , and companies run well when employees engage and are committed .	-4.7940
If the analytics tools of third parties promise to increase the commitment and use of employees , it is no wonder that you will find support .	-4.3385
The data on employee engagement according to the experts of job culture important .	-5.1698
But the data are useless if the managers of a company do not take action .	-3.4893
Indeed , when a company asks employees for your feedback , it may have a expectation that change is on the way .	-4.2407
And if change does not come quickly enough , or not at all , it can cause disappointments and discourage employees .	-4.4461
" If you ask for 4,000 suggestions , you must be prepared to have 4,000 talks , " said Russell Raath , President of Consulting at the Business Management Company Kotter International , which has seen companies that have relied too much on collecting data .	-3.8973
" Because if you will not follow employees ask , " Have you really heard me ?	-2.8500
Is that what you are looking for ?	-3.0829
Who do not care , why should I ? '	-2.7629
Madison Reed , who is now conducting monthly employee surveys , was able to take action on the same day when a problem is reported about Glint , so excited .	-3.6969
And after gathering feedback from frustrated employees , they were able to reorganize several teams within the company and add a communication training to address the problems .	-4.1984
At Ruby Tuesday , the company is getting new insights into its employees , and it hopes that in the long term this will lead to a better bond of workers in an industry known for high sales .	-5.8863
" If you are not committed to creating a culture of transparency , you will lose people , " said Vitrano .	-2.5289
" And if you lose people , you also lose customers .	-1.6042
And if you lose customers , you will lose companies .	-1.7689
The NCAA eliminates two-day practices and makes a long day for the Bruins .	-2.8984
It goes up to 23 o 'clock when a lot of UCLA football players are on a side of the team 's new training fields on the campus .	-6.5583
Some have removed their jersey parts and show their back full of sweat from the first day of the training camp .	-3.7164
For a good part of the team these idle minutes represent a lunch break .	-3.5441
Players enrolled in summer courses will return to their final examination after a three-hour exercise before returning to the Waterman Football Center the next morning .	-4.4333
" This is a real Tretmühle for the boys the next three days , " said Bruins-Trainer Jim Mora just before Monday became Tuesday .	-4.7198
The NCAA eliminates two day exercises to ease the burden of the player and has actually extended their days - at least until Friday 's final .	-6.3730
That ’ s why the UCLA ’ s first three training sessions should start at 19 : 15 to meet the players ’ already packed schedule .	-5.6896
The compromise away from the two days is more than a day when the Bruins moved the beginning of the camp almost a week after the last season and during the summer school for the first time during Moras conducted six games in Westwood practical exercises .	-5.9480
20 before the start of the formal game preparation for Texas A & M in September , they will with 18 .	-9.0694
Mora said that he supported the rule change of the NCAA , even by adding another point to the player ’ s busy routes .	-5.2997
" We put this enormous burden on them three or four days , and it is very challenging , " said Mora .	-2.0458
" And they simply got it through , they continue to flare , they are great people .	-5.4124
I think that as soon as we come to Saturday and we have more time , it will be really great ' .	-3.8973
The UCLA will end its practices as soon as the camp is finished , which , given the clear lines of its fields , will not be an easy task , given the clear lines of sight of its fields , from a adjacent parking place and the adjacent Luskin Center , a superior class hotel , which was already filled with footballs , which provided a safety net behind a turf stop .	-9.1551
Bruins-players are supposed to occupy the hotel from this weekend , but Mora admitted that there could be a problem once these rooms are free during the season .	-5.1086
" We will use our security , " said Mora .	-2.3017
" This is a real problem , and it is not far-fetched to think that people there rent a room and then prepare to record an exercise .	-4.4915
If you have the video tape of an exercise , it is quite a good deal .	-2.4126
But we have security forces there and we have security forces on parking 8 .	-2.1012
We will do the best we have .	-1.4388
I am not too concerned about that .	-3.2987
We have a plan . '	-0.9191
Facebook wants to intensify Tatsack Review in the fight against fake news .	-7.1264
Facebook wants to send more potential articles with fake reviews from third parties and then show their results under the original post , said Thursday ’ s world ’ s largest online social network , one of its efforts to fight “ fake news . ”	-5.9578
The company said in an opinion on its website that it will start using updated machine learning methods to identify possible fake reports and send them to fact-testers who may show results from the original article .	-6.7489
Facebook was criticised as one of the main distributional points for so-called fake news , many of which believe that they also influenced the US presidential election in 2016 .	-3.1688
The problem has also become a major political issue in Europe , with French voters being flooded with false stories in the run-up to the May presidential election , and Germany supports a plan to punish social media networks if they fail to quickly eliminate hateful postings , as before the September elections .	-4.9964
On Thursday , Facebook said in a separate statement in German that a test of the new fact-verification will be launched in the US , France , the Netherlands and Germany .	-3.4642
" In addition to knowing what stories are being contested by fact-testers of third parties , people want more context to make informed decisions about what they read and share , " said Sara Su , product manager for Facebook news in a blog .	-6.8599
She added that Facebook will continue to test its feature on the " related article " and work on other changes to its message feed to reduce false messages .	-3.5488
Creation of a comic novel : A Castle in the History of England	-1.8432
In his recent past , the small Scotney Castle was seen in a squeeze music video and was a loophole for Margaret Thatcher in the 1970s and 1980s .	-4.4678
But Scotney has experienced 700 years of turbulent history of his cosy seat in the Bewl River Valley in Kent , and has now become an inspiration for a graphical novel by Jamie Rhodes , a mophory Yorkshire with a fondness for historical documents .	-5.8469
" I think it is so beautiful to look at the handwriting of someone who has been dead for 300 years , " he said troublesome .	-4.0196
'What a personal relationship to keep this letter in my hands ' .	-2.2957
' A Castle in England ' covers the period from the Middle Ages to the age of Edward and documents the families that lived in Scotney .	-4.0710
It is not the first book of Rhodes based on an archive : he wrote in 2014 ' Dead Men 's Teith and Other Stories ' , a collection inspired by documents in the British Library - a project that he found emotionally unexpected .	-3.3419
" I only reacted to the pressure of fingers on the side of a letter written by a double agent in the 1700-s , who worked for the Jacobins , " he says .	-4.7389
" That is his pressure on the thumb !	-2.3077
And letters always smells of smoke , for at that time one ignited a fire because of the light .	-4.4463
For someone who lives 300 years later , the smell has an effect as though it were .	-3.5889
Oh , I love archives ! '	-0.8962
For someone who is so beaten with old papers that he is supported by the National Trust and the Arts Council of England and lived in a castle almost four months ( " To be honest , I have overvalued my bid bid a little " ) , this seems all too nice to be true .	-5.8833
Rhodes spent his days exploring the Victorian " new " castle , viewing the archives , and studying the many treasures and curiosities of the castle , such as the monstrous Hyland heads on the walls and the bottles that had spent centuries in the grave .	-6.2084
He moved through the site and the ruins of the old castle and talked with landscape carers , gardeners and sometimes with artists working on the illustrations of his book .	-4.5406
Then , at night he dranked " whiskey and began to write " .	-3.6920
The intimate history of Scotney is relatively unknown , since the National Trust received full access only in 2006 when the last heir , Elizabeth Hussey , died .	-3.5565
When Rhodes arrived a decade later , the employees began to take care of the archive he described as " hundreds of years in which aristocrats said " Oh , it was on the attic " .	-5.3800
diaries , letters from the time of English Empire , maps that represent what they did : " You might think that land conflicts would be boring , " says Rhodes , " but there was a birch to fight the two families .	-5.1246
Guys , let everything go ! '	-3.0783
Some of the stories in the collection use the castle as a starting point to dive into English history on a broader basis , including ' The Labours ' , following a man who left the newly built castle to join the 1381 farmstead .	-5.5629
" There is a record of an uprising that appeared in the castle in 1380 , in this book entitled " Knightly Family of Kent and Sussex " , says Rhodes .	-4.2024
" The uprising began in this area and I thought an uprising was a good beginning .	-2.7796
Perhaps the two are interconnected ? '	-2.2145
Other stories are deeply rooted in the history of the castle , such as the Priest , which tells the story of the Jesuit father , who the Darrell family kept hidden for seven years during the English Reformation .	-4.9733
Or ' The Smuggler ' , which depicts the smuggler Arthur Darrell from the 18th century , who staged his own funeral by filling a coffin of stones ( a discovery made years later when his coffin was excavated ) .	-4.4629
The Darrells are Rhodes ' favourite family of Scotney : " The gentlemen seemed to be some Gauner , always making debts and spending money on things they could not afford .	-4.7901
Other generations of Darrell men triggered their debt crises by marching rich old women - I imagine them as a bunch of good looking boys , with a talent to advertise heirs . "	-4.3815
After his stay in the castle , Rhodes is looking for other unique writing experiences .	-3.7659
He left behind a two-week stay in the Finnish wilderness for a comic novel about Elämmäki , the site of a sanatoria from the early 20th century , which has since been called back by nature .	-8.7141
But Scotney has a special place for him .	-2.7964
" I was sad to go again , " he says .	-0.9251
It was like : ' Oh , now I have to deal with the damned life ' .	-3.6544
Campaign : Over 300 years old Marienkapelle in Rhöndorf hides .	-3.8684
With the coverage of the 301 years of Marienkapelle in Rhondorf , the city of Bad Honnef launched its campaign to introduce a new umbrella brand ( Thursday 's tour ) .	-5.8633
Until Thursday , Mayor Otto Neuhoff and his marketing team around Nelson Artz want to keep the logo and the slogan secret .	-2.6162
At the end of August there will be a celebration on the island of Grafenwerth .	-3.5864
" Very nice for us .	-2.4720
Or ? " , the operators of the action have been asking on the posters of the Rhöndorfer chapel since yesterday .	-5.0766
" We don 't really think this ( of course ) , " they write on their yesterday released website .	-3.6129
" But we use this measure to gain your attention .	-1.3866
And to make it clear that some things are better than it seems .	-2.2147
In fact , we are firmly convinced that as a Bad Honnefer we know about the beauty and attractiveness of our city . '	-5.3254
The action is more than just a logo and a slogan , it continues .	-3.2522
" It is important to formulate a single promise , one that gives the city a distinctive unique identity . "	-6.0812
After all , they are competing with other communities .	-2.3671
The city of Bad Honnef can cost a mid-five digit amount of its new umbrella brand and campaign .	-5.1184
Turkey ’ s Military Reforms – Erdogan ’ s Fear of the Army	-1.9171
Every year at the beginning of August , the Supreme Military Council ( YAS ) advises on retirement and promotion in the Official Corps .	-4.1280
So , this week too .	-5.5281
At first glance a normal operation .	-1.9783
But nothing is routine in the Turkish armed forces one year after the coup attempt .	-2.3439
The meeting was no longer held in the General Staff building , as before , but at the Prime Minister 's office .	-4.2376
During the discussions under the chairmanship of the Heads of State , the five Vice-Chairmen , as well as the Ministers for Defence , Home Affairs , Justice and Foreign Affairs , have also taken part .	-7.1356
As a result , the majority of civilians in the YAS were in the .	-4.8421
The government is wing the reins in the military .	-2.4591
Chief of Staff , Hulusi Akar , remains in office , but the army commanders , the air force , and the navy were dismissed .	-4.5776
Since the failed coup , Erdogan has fired 169 of the 326 generals and admitters .	-2.8318
Over 10,000 soldiers were removed from the ranks of the army - mostly due to supposed connections to the Exil Preacher Fehullah Gülen movement , which Erdogan sees as a masterminds of the coup attempt .	-5.2298
There have been negotiations in Ankara since this week against 486 people who have been directly involved in the coup attempt .	-3.9955
As early as the day after the coup , Erdogan referred to the attempted upheaval as a " gift of God " because he gave him the opportunity to " completely clean up the armed forces " .	-6.5179
But does Erdogan really have the army under control ?	-2.0710
At the end of February , the newspaper " Hrriyet " published an article entitled " Unease in Military Headquarters " .	-3.4567
The newspaper wrote that there are concerns among the general staff about the increasing " Islamicisation " of the army , which is manifesting itself , among other things , in the lifting of the ban on wearing the headscarf for soldiers .	-5.3564
In any case , the wholesale clean-up in the army and the security forces will continue .	-4.5227
In mid-July , Erdogan issued a decree to fire another 7395 civil servants , including 2303 policemen and 546 soldiers .	-4.1307
It seemed that Erdo<unk>an had tamed the military .	-2.9428
The generals used to be the true masters of the country .	-2.6147
Three times , they appealed to their role as the guardian of the secular government .	-4.1042
After his victory in 2002 , Erdogan pushed back the military ’ s power step by step , not least by invoking the European Union ’ s reform targets .	-4.8042
Former officers say that Erdogan is deliberately pushing for the Islamicisation of the armed forces .	-2.8489
In the Vocal Europe magazine , a non-named officer who sought asylum after the coup attempt for fear of persecution abroad warned that the Turkish army would be " full of extremists and Salafists " in a few years ' time .	-7.5769
If so , this could not make NATO cold .	-3.7886
In any case , after the purges , there are doubts about the Turkish army ’ s readiness to act .	-4.3606
NATO diplomats say that the leadership structures and operational capabilities are " weakened " .	-2.7193
Washington ’ s Green Card Rules	-1.0548
There will be a new US immigration plan to change the rules of the Green Card , said President Donald Trump , quoted by the media .	-2.2010
It provides for the reduction of legal immigrants to 50,000 per year , stricter rules for obtaining visas for temporary work permits and restrictions on family visas .	-4.3499
The new rules are proposed by the Republicans and supported by the President .	-2.4562
The bill is to be discussed in the two chambers of Congress .	-1.7097
" This law will reduce poverty , increase wages , and save billions of dollars on taxpayers , and will do so by changing the way the US spends Green Cards on citizens from other countries . "	-4.0795
The law will prevent chain migration and replace the current system .	-1.7087
This new application procedure will benefit the candidates who speak English , who have the financial means to support themselves and show knowledge that will benefit our economy , " Trump quoted from the American media .	-5.2820
Ministry wants to renovate route for race steaks .	-3.4419
Over the past few months , we have repeatedly had disputes about the future of the race steepship - now it is time to proceed very quickly .	-7.2996
Before the end of the year it is planned to build on the steep route on which the tourist track runs .	-6.7283
According to the Ministry of Transport , construction work is planned to begin this year in order to secure the future of the racetrack hut in the long term .	-5.8108
" With the decision to continue to order and renew the route Ilmenau-Rennsteig , the country is committed to this connection , which is particularly important for tourism " , said Secretary of State Klaus Sühl , on Friday , in Erfurt .	-8.2115
He put the cost of repairing the route at around EUR 2.5 million .	-2.9800
Of that amount , the country is taking 75 % .	-4.5650
The contract on which the shuttle should be ordered by the country in the future will be finally agreed upon , said Eehl .	-7.2830
The Ministry and the Südthüringen Railway as an operator are already in agreement on the technical details .	-3.2089
" This is the road map that negotiated the vehicles used and the quality standards , " said Sühl .	-4.0053
The planned contract between the Ministry and the Railway Company will be concluded for a period of 11 years .	-3.1998
The race shuttle should be ordered regular on December 2017 .	-3.0200
The Rennsteig shuttle is a popular rail link between the Ilmenau and Rentensteig stations , especially among tourists .	-5.1289
In recent months , a pilot operation has tested whether the track is used by enough people to keep it regular in future .	-5.1498
The route is also partially partially partially partially partially partially partially partially .	-4.3400
The rise of sex robots is real , and we should be concerned about it .	-1.7759
Just when you thought that 2017 cannot be made any worse , a new report on technological developments in the field of sex robots comes into being .	-4.1087
Yes , indeed .	-1.0306
Sexual robots are a big thing at the moment .	-2.5641
The Foundation for Responsible Robotics ( FRR ) recently published a report on the development of sex robots in the next five to ten years .	-2.0085
According to Noel Sharkey , Emerging Professor of Robotics and Artificial Intelligence at the University of Sheffield and co-founder of FRR , we must begin to take their rise seriously .	-4.3972
Customers can choose the eye color of the robot , its shape of the chest and the type of fingernail .	-3.1817
" People are making love about them , but the companies make a lot of it , and we will see it much more often , " Mr Sharkey said when he published his new report .	-6.2119
Modern sex dolls have evolved from their inflatable partners to robots with a silicone skin that feels warm - with consciously human reactions achieved by artificial intelligence .	-3.3070
The user can also " adapt " his robot according to his beliefs , selecting everything from the eye color of the robot to the shape of the chest arms to the type or color of his finger nails .	-4.9680
But it is even more worrying because many robots have the " personalities " that would make a step-woman progressive .	-4.5586
Modern sex dolls have become robots with a silicone skin .	-1.8735
For example , the RealBotix robot allows its users to adapt their robots to the features they find appealing , such as bully .	-4.8407
And then there is the Roxxy Gold sex-robots developed by True Companion with pre-programmed personalities such as Frigid Farrah , who gives the impression of bully and " Wild Wendy " with an " adventurous " personality .	-5.5975
" Roxxxy Gold has a personality that is as well adapted to your personality , " Swaps the website of True Companion .	-5.5540
She loves what you like , and she doesn 't like what you do , etc .	-3.3722
Over the course of the day she also has her voices - quite like real people !	-4.6511
She can be tired , fixated on conversation or she can be " in mood " !	-2.0243
There are many worrying aspects to this rise of sex robots - not least because they replace real human relationships - but the subterated female characteristics , the allusion to rape , when one step is taken on Frigid ( that is , repealed ) Farrah , are most worrying .	-6.6446
On his website True Companion Roxxy compared with a vibrator , but for men .	-2.2679
" If women ( sic ) can have a vibrator , why can men not have a Roxxxy ? " is it said on the website .	-5.4017
However , these sex-robots are not just a fetish or stop just another sex toys .	-3.3035
Their emergence and their growing refinement point to something more sparkle and deeper in our culture , to a retreat from the ideal of gender equality to a desire for sex with submission as an optional addition .	-5.3515
Most men will not hold sex robots , of course , and while the FRR notices its growing popularity , they will remain temporarily on the margins of the consumer culture .	-5.9407
But what leaks from the periphery may be very instructive in relation to the spirit of the time in which we live .	-3.0308
And many people are not strange or offensive until the free market gives them permission to do so .	-2.5165
There is a certain overlap that this highly developed sex robot is appearing at a time when women ’ s rights are being threatened worldwide , where there is a president in the White House who has been screaming to have sexually .	-6.7481
The most dissuasive aspect of the TV series ' The Handmaid 's Tale ' ( ' The Report of the Magd ' ) are not the graphic images , the blurred bodies and the eyes , but how realistic this vision works .	-5.0776
The Republic of Gilead is a jump , but at the moment it does not feel like a big jump .	-3.1662
The goal behind these sex robots is to make a physical similarity to actual women as realistic as possible in technical terms ( though with porn exercises ) .	-5.5343
Their builders want them to feel human , to imitate the movement of a real body .	-2.3993
But , finally , when it comes to their " personalities " , the robots do not represent real women .	-3.2893
You can 't disconnect from your pet or simply leave it .	-5.0000
They have no mediation or background history , no evidence of independence or anything that could disrupt the imagination of total submission .	-4.8787
In other words , they are false slaves .	-2.1275
Or to put it in the 2017 saying : Brothers .	-3.3172
Trump ’ s Great Performance ?	-1.0821
He makes Mitt Romney the embodiment of common sense .	-1.6688
It has become a trump-era truncation that the political divisions that polarized the US electorate have also split small families .	-4.2868
Around Christmas and Harvest , there have been newspapers in the US about how to deal with the horror of Trump ’ s favorite .	-5.0963
We are all supposed to make our filter bubbles burst .	-4.4665
Less noticed , Trump ’ s power to bring families together has been .	-2.8956
I mention this because my cousin , a left-wing poet who lives in Chicago and has long been working with the Republicans in our family , visited me this week in New York .	-3.4776
She reminded me that unity against a common enemy can have a powerful effect .	-1.3906
With Trump at the White House , anyone she knows , including the Republican family , with whom she had fought for decades for politics , is suddenly and glibly on the same side .	-5.4347
Around the dining table this is certainly a good thing , but it strikes me in another context that this also entails considerable risks .	-4.9637
The left has been strengthened by Trump , but his presidency ’ s ineffectiveness has the strength to push us all right .	-4.2214
When we talk about " normalization " and Trump , we refer to the gruesome possibility that one day his mice will no longer blow us .	-4.3520
But there is an even more daunting long-term scenario in which Trump ’ s right-wing Republicans " normalize " , which suddenly seem to be an embodiment of reasonableness relative to his standards .	-5.4862
Today , I find myself affected by an active nostalgia for Mitt Romney ’ s original version of crazy – the car roof dog , the 14 % income tax ( but at least we knew how his tax declaration looked like ) – both of which , compared to Trump , are in fact considered to be very mild crimes .	-7.4929
If Trump goes , the Republicans ’ next candidate must be only mentally healthy to qualify as immeasurable improvement .	-4.4067
When I was in the city , we brought our children to the carousel in Central Park , the largest of the New York car park carousels , and the best three dollars to spend in the city if you don 't need a caffeine .	-5.0887
The horses are enormous , the fiberglass designs on the central cylinder - all clowns are knitted and the animals turn around to look at their own shoulders full of fear - extremely dark and the climping music conveys this in an odd way .	-7.2220
So many clichés of a city disappoint : the views of high buildings are old , the Skylines are trusted to provide a lot of excitement , and the reality of the city does not live up to the dream .	-4.4903
Thirty and fifteen years later , and I am still not completely over the day when I found that Swiss Cottage is not in fact a Swiss Cottage - the Thematic Pub Ye Olde Swiss Cottage counts not - but a large circulation in the north of London .	-6.2583
However , the Central Parkcarousel is still a strange experience , since two years , one 11-year-old and two women can go there in the 40 ’ s and all have a great time .	-9.3646
If I could have rated the carousel , I would have given him the full point , but fortunately nobody asked for it .	-4.3270
On the other hand , in a department store this week , I was forced to evaluate my " experience " with transactions on a scale from one to five stars before I could get through my credit card .	-4.1635
In the coffee shop on the corner of my street it is the same , plus the option to offset the rating with a 15 % tip - this to buy something about the shop table .	-4.9022
This not only slows down what should be a neutral exchange , but also puts pressure on the server to bring personality into a situation where no need is made .	-3.8657
The poor woman in the department store was apologized while I was tired of getting her five stars credit card .	-5.1952
transferred Oscar Pistorius with breast pain from prison to hospital	-2.0139
Pistorius left for the second time the prison for a visit to hospital .	-3.1528
Last year , he was brought to hospital for the treatment of cuts , which he told the prison authorities that he suffered after a case in his cell .	-5.1469
Pistorius was convicted of murder for an appeal by prosecutors against a first death sentence .	-3.6744
He killed Steenkamp during the early morning hours of Valentine 's Day in 2013 by shooting her several times through a door of the toilet cabin in his home in Pretoria .	-5.0699
Pistorius claimed that he held his friend for a night intruder , who was hidden in the cabin .	-4.7464
The prosecutors have announced their intention to appeal this time to the six-year sentence of Pistorius , which they say is too lenient .	-3.0529
The National Law Office said that it would appeal to the Supreme Court of South Africa and that the appeal could be heard this year .	-4.3732
Pistorius runs the risk of his penalty being increased to 15 years if the prosecutors are successful .	-3.2676
There is no death penalty in South Africa .	-0.7401
When Bauer Arnold finds a odd Ei	-6.6370
As the last of the Blumberger schools , the four monasteries were released from the feet and Epfenhofen in the holidays and in the secondary schools .	-6.8975
In the future , three of these students will go to school , four at the secondary school .	-6.7664
On Tuesday evening , head of school Angelika Sitte welcomed the parents and representatives of the public at the Bürgerhaus Bielental in Epfenhofen .	-3.8544
As a symbol of school release , the 29 students of the four classes , led by Sophia Schumacher and director Meder , chose a young eagle who grew up in the chicken farm but then was released into freedom .	-6.0706
In addition , the muntere Shar performed a musical entitled " Der Adler im Hennerhof " .	-7.0742
Bauer Arnold found a strange egg , leaving it from his chickens .	-1.9461
A small eagle instead of a chicken kitchen came out .	-3.5827
But the hope of making a chicken from him fell apart , the eagle spread his wings on a high mountain and disappeared .	-3.9985
After that , the classes three and four showed a chicken dance in the composition of Yvonne Frank .	-4.0330
The Henns danced with the young gockles that bore cylinders to bet .	-3.5653
The eagle stands for integration , says schoolchief Angelika Sitte .	-3.0719
Although the kitten is different from the other kittens , it is one of them .	-3.8600
But he will never be like a chicken .	-1.3946
His provision is to be free .	-1.9319
She wanted every fourth plaintiff to feel accepted in his new school .	-3.7978
Many thanks were then given to our colleagues , the former head of school Michael Müller , who repeatedly jumps into school passports and the parents representatives .	-7.1479
The Kükenzeit is now over , explained class teacher Sophia Schumacher .	-4.0028
After two years of teaching they are very reluctant to leave their students because it was a really great time .	-5.7239
Finally , they could rely on the four klässler .	-3.8906
In conclusion , all students made a song of summer time and holiday time .	-6.6743
The children were delighted with this .	-3.9936
Eight first plaintiffs are already registered for the new school year .	-3.5216
Two Bulgarians arrested for illegal camping in Greece	-0.8450
Two Bulgarians were imprisoned for illegal camping in Greece , informed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs , quoted by television .	-3.1836
On the morning of 1 August , police arrested a group of people illegally camping in Sithonia , including the two Bulgarians .	-3.0446
They were released on the same day , while an inquiry is currently under way .	-3.2592
The Ministry of Foreign Affairs reported bTV that the Bulgarians were released later .	-1.3823
The Greek authorities have tightened controls on free camps and imposed considerable fines on anyone who is found to remain in a place that is not intended for this purpose .	-4.8411
The controls will continue throughout the season .	-1.4278
The ministry said that the court can impose a fine .	-1.8505
Software Update for Diesel vehicles : What the people affected need to know now .	-3.1038
How exactly does the software update take place ?	-1.1733
Do diesel drivers have to take part in the action ?	-2.3420
View the most important questions and answers .	-3.0915
At the Diesel Summit , BMW , Daimler , Opel and the Volkswagen Group have offered software updates for a total of around 5.3 million cars .	-3.4179
They should improve the exhaust performance of cars in emission classes Euro 5 and in part Euro 6 .	-4.1070
Euro 4 diesel or worse are excluded .	-1.8488
Anja Smetanon of the ACE Auto Club Europe gives assessments :	-3.8044
Is the new action mandatory ?	-1.3380
No , the negotiated software updates are voluntary .	-0.9957
" The mandatory updates previously apply only to the vehicles that have Schumann software , " says Anja Smetann .	-4.2431
Their rearmament has ordered the Austrian Federal Office of the ( K) .	-4.8350
How and when will customers be informed about updates ?	-2.4303
The manufacturers have announced a speedy implementation in the coming months , but have not yet set a precise date .	-4.3725
Daimler has announced that it will assign to each party concerned .	-4.0449
If an inspection is due in any case , it will be carried out within its framework .	-2.8841
How long should the overall equipment be moved ?	-3.3727
" Hard to say " , says Smetana .	-3.5414
This depends on the commitment of the manufacturers and on political pressure .	-2.8724
" We have seen voluntary action by car manufacturers on the environmental issue so far . "	-4.5897
How long should the update take ?	-1.3364
The conversion itself could take only three to four hours in the workshop .	-3.0986
Time consuming could be getting a date .	-3.9833
What are drivers who do not drive a car from BMW , Daimler , Opel and the VW Group ?	-2.6312
The ACE provides advice for waiting .	-3.1049
It is likely that foreign producers would pull in , Smetania .	-5.2746
Is there a massive drop in the price of Euro 4 cars ?	-3.3949
The ACE fears this .	-1.5985
But it is precisely in those regions where there is a danger of banning driving .	-8.1257
There is no loss of value for older diesel in rural areas .	-3.0380
The ACE advice is to wait for a sale .	-3.2115
LL Cool J receives Kennedy Center-Award .	-2.4920
The Kennedy Awards Gala is one of the most glamorous events in Washington .	-0.9642
The first Trump prize-giving promise to become political .	-2.5550
One of the winners does not want to come - out of protest .	-1.6012
LL Cool J ( 49 ) gets one of the most coveted awards from the prestigious Kennedy Center .	-3.8776
As the cultural establishment announced on Thursday , this year also includes singer Gloria Estefan ( 59 ) , Lionel Richie ( 68 ) , as well as the choreographer Carmen de Lavallade ( 86 ) and TV producer Norman Lear ( 95 ) .	-5.5504
The awards will be presented at the beginning of December .	-1.8287
Traditionally , US President Donald Trump will host a reception and participate in the award together with his wife , Melania .	-3.5640
The prize-winner Lear , announced with progressive TV series , has already announced that he will not participate in the Gala .	-6.3221
The " New York Times " he said : " This presidency has decided to neglect the arts and human rights in full - even to deprive them of the resources - and this affects me " .	-6.2900
The 59-year-old Estefan emphasized that she will use the conversation with Trump to clarify her point of view .	-2.4344
The Kennedy Center , named after former president John F. Kennedy , is the largest cultural institution in the US capital .	-2.4878
Some of the earlier prize winners include Meryl Streep , Aretha Franklin , Robert De Niro , George Lucas , Tom Hanks , and Sting .	-4.7742
We make the City Life	-2.6025
Roland Wacker , Haslach Stadtbauster , will retire next year .	-3.5181
The place is already advertised - suitable candidates are however rar .	-2.7319
For 31 years Wacker has been the city builder .	-3.4975
And the work still gives him great fun as he communicates in the press .	-4.3032
He reports of varied but demanding tasks that await his successor .	-3.2646
At the same time , he is surprised that so far no application has met the requirements specifications .	-3.9403
The city is looking for an architect or engineer at the next possible time .	-4.1963
In this way - taking into account the regular termination deadlines - there is still enough time to complete the work .	-7.2459
Since Haslach acts as a sub-law authority for the administrative community , the applicant must provide relevant qualifications .	-5.1167
This function definitely wants to keep the city .	-3.3521
If they were to be unable to fill them , citizens would have to go to Offenburg for advice .	-4.6639
But proximity to the citizens is important to the city and to it itself , says Wacker , who reports of a good working climate and a good mood between the public and the public .	-5.2591
In more than 30 years in office , some important projects that Wacker takes pride in looking back at .	-5.2937
" We make the city worth living " , it is safe through the construction office and its staff .	-4.8357
In the future , however , there will be a wide range of projects on the agenda : the transformation of the former Huklan Areals and the Niederhofenparkplatz , for example , has been initiated .	-7.7414
The Kinzigbridge between Bollenbach and Steinach is being renewed , even the stadium animation is still theme .	-4.3692
The latter alone will beat at around EUR 1.5 million , " if we get it right , " estimates Wacker .	-4.9224
" All in all , there are great tasks waiting for my successor .	-3.0886
The work here is fun . '	-1.4361
There is a lot of room for a master city tree in design .	-6.0323
With Haslach 's own Bauhof and Gärtnerei , there are many ways to react flexibly .	-6.1930
" You can move a lot " , says Wacker , and the design of the green spaces is often praised by citizens and visitors .	-4.5546
Since the old town is classified as an ensemble of historical monuments , it is important to have " an eye for what fits in " when new buildings are approved , the outgoing town builder emphasizes .	-6.9464
In any case , the City Tree Leader has a high responsibility .	-4.7677
He is a owner , " at the end everything runs over my table " .	-4.5479
With support and coordination he can count on many years of employees : Markus Neumaier ( Hochbau ) has been doing so for ten years , Manfred Schöner ( Tiefbau ) for 15 years .	-5.8249
Wacker also hopes that his successor will continue for a long time : " We are looking for someone who really wants to identify and stay with the place " .	-6.6271
For continuity is important not only for a good working climate but also for the further design of the city .	-4.3110
According to the information provided by the town of Haslach , anyone who wants to attend Roland Wacker should have completed a degree as a diplomat or Bachelor of Architecture and have good expertise in the fields of building and planning law .	-9.3253
The City Building Office is responsible for the construction , construction planning , basic employment , management of urban properties , the Municipal Works with Bauhof and the Municipal Commission , as well as the Untere Baurechtätschaft , including historical protection .	-11.1208
Bicycle on lines cast : Southern railway locked .	-3.3322
According to the police , the previously unknown perpetrators had thrown the blue bicycle from railway tracks in the area of Leober Stra<unk>e ( B116 ) onto the lines .	-5.0760
They were so badly damaged that the forthcoming freight train had to be stopped .	-3.3929
The investigators run out of two male actresses and have been looking for them since the night hours .	-5.4265
A pink scooter and a bicycle driver were observed near the village .	-4.3998
" This goes well beyond a prank , " said <unk>BB-Speacher Christoph Poch to APA .	-5.6220
The perpetrator or perpetrator would have put himself in great danger and also put the train at risk .	-4.4789
In addition to the damage done at the train and the facility , the minutes of delay and the cost of rail replacement traffic , the car users could also reach the perpetrators .	-8.6214
All in all , it was to be expected that there would be a ' substantial ' sum , said the speaker .	-6.1088
The damages were fixed again on Friday afternoon and rail traffic on the southern railway route could be done without any disabilities .	-6.6077
Nearly ten passenger trains were dropped on Friday morning , two of which concerned long-distance transport .	-4.4186
Goods trains did not fall , but were delayed .	-3.0952
According to <unk>BB-Speacher Christoph Poch there had to be replaced around 200 meters of instruction .	-4.9804
Isolators and masts were also damaged .	-1.2528
Red meat , dairy products , and chocolate could help ease IBD ( inflammatory intestinal disease )	-2.8427
Red meat and chocolate can sound like a nightmare for your digestive system .	-1.7174
But a new study claims the very opposite : a diet rich in meat based proteins and dairy products may relieve the symptoms of patients with inflammatory intestines .	-3.3506
The malevolent state in the US , which affects some 1.3 million and 300,000 in the United Kingdom , causes stomach herbs and blonds , recurrent or bloody diarrhea , weight loss , and extreme fatigue .	-6.8178
While those affected are usually advised to avoid meat and dairy products to relieve their symptoms , researchers at Washingtoner University found that the essential amino acid tryptohan of proteins helps to develop immune cells that promote a tolerant intestine .	-4.9422
The leading researcher , Dr. Marco Colonna , explained that immunology cells patrol the intestine to ensure that harmful microbes hiding in food do not penetrate the body .	-4.9443
Cells capable of eliminating inflammation are compensated by cells that promote tolerance and protect the body without damaging sensitive tissue .	-2.8035
If the balance tends too far towards inflammation , an inflammatory illness may result .	-3.5288
In experiments , it was found that a kind of tolerance supporting immune cell occurs in mice wearing a particular bacterium in their females .	-6.6731
And the bacterium requires tryptophan - one of the building blocks of proteins - to trigger the appearance of the cells .	-3.1727
Professor Colonna said : " We have established a link between a bacterial - lactatacillus reuteri - which is a normal part of the intestinal microbiology , and the development of a population of cells promoting tolerance .	-4.8244
The more Tryptophan had the mice in their food , the more they had from these immune cells " .	-2.5757
He proposed that the combination of L. reuteri and a diet rich in tryptophan promote less inflammatory intestinus if the same system also applies to humans .	-8.8314
The Postdoctorandin Dr. Luisa Cervantes tried to study a kind of immuncell that encourages tolerance when it found that a group of study mice had such cells , but another group of the same tribe , but who was isolated , did not .	-6.4771
She believed that the difference was with the antimicrobial microorganisms - the community of bacteria , viruses and fungi normally living in the gastrointestinal tract .	-5.2632
The mice ’ s demons were DNA sequenzed , and six bacteria species found in the mice with the immune cells were found , but without them missing from the mice .	-5.6722
mice were raised in a sterile environment , so they lacked a microstructure and did not develop this type of immune cells , and they received the L. reuteri and the immune cells .	-5.5340
In order to understand how the bacteria applied to the immune system , researchers L. reuteri grew in a liquid and then transferred small quantities of fluid - without bacteria - to immature immune cells isolated by mice .	-4.5682
The immune cells became tolerant cells .	-1.3632
When the active component was purified from the fluid , it proved to be a by-product of Tryptohan metabolism known as Indol-3 lactic acid .	-4.2826
When researchers doubled the amount of tryptophan in mice ’ s feed , the number of such cells increased by about 50 % , but when tryptophans were halved , the number of cells fell by half .	-4.2431
Dr. Cervantes barrian explained that people have the same tolerant cells as mice , and that most of us protect L. reuteri in our gastrointestinal tract .	-4.6270
It is not known whether tryptophan by-products from L. reuteri develop cells in humans as in mice , but defects in genes related to tryptophan have been found in humans with inflammatory intestinal disease .	-4.9389
She said : " The development of these cells is probably something we want to promote , as these cells control inflammation on the inner surface of the intestine .	-5.4443
Potentially , high levels of tryptophane in the presence of L. reuteri can lead to an expansion of this population ' .	-4.4641
Jose Mourinho believes that Manchester United has committed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic .	-2.3911
At Manchester United signed a " genius " with Nemanja Matic , Jose Mourinho , after the midfielder had his debut on Saturday evening .	-4.9535
Chelsea ’ s 40 million signature began with a 2 : 1 victory in Dublin , the last pre-season game , before the UEFA Super Cup against Real Madrid begins on Tuesday , and impressed in the holder ’ s role as people like Paul Pogba and Andreas Pereira marched to his will .	-6.7846
Matic , however , was excluded from the blues ’ s preparatory Asian tour and made only 45 minutes , which Mourinho admitted that he had to improve before the start of the Premier League season .	-4.2430
" He needs time , but his experience , intelligence , a genius in the way he thinks - he thinks football , " said Mourinho .	-1.6589
" We will help him to be ready sooner than later . "	-2.9115
In addition to Matic , Victor Lindelof and Romelu Lukaku also started at the Aviva stadium , when Mourinho formed his start XI for the start of the season .	-5.7871
This week , the Independent revealed that Mourinho wanted three more new commitments , but he insisted that the club had already done a " fantastic job " to meet three of its four priority new commitments .	-7.1989
" To get three of four , for which I thank the club , " he added .	-3.1530
" I will be happier if they get four out of four for me , but they have made a lot of effort ' .	-4.4497
Boeing ' painted ' Dreamliner in the Sky	-1.9466
Boeing 's US aircraft manufacturer has painted the silhouette of a Dreamliner into the sky . the of . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-4.9468
The pilots flew from Seattle in the US State of Washington , but the drawings began in Marquette in US state Michigan and moved in the form of a Dreamliner over the US , which is several thousand kilometres .	-4.7988
The action lasted 18 hours and one minute .	-1.5713
On radar was the form of a Dreamliner .	-2.7891
The whole thing was an endurance test for new engines .	-4.0683
Boeing had already made such advertising before .	-2.4527
So the number " 787 " and the boarding logo were painted into the sky .	-2.4512
New low for Martin Schulz - Hannover , we have a problem	-2.7860
As the wind turns , when Sigmar Gabriel was head of the SPD , social democratic prime ministers always looked to Berlin with some concern before the elections .	-5.5950
If no disturbance from the party ’ s headquarters , just no headwinds from the federal government , that was the main wish of the campaign .	-7.5512
Since Martin Schulz led the party , this has changed fundamentally .	-2.0861
Since then , people from the Willy-Brandt House have been watching events in the SPD ’ s governing capitals with growing .	-4.9763
What Schulz has received from there since the beginning of the year would not even be described by headwinds .	-3.9127
There were slumps .	-3.2728
And one by one .	-2.4300
Following the surprising end of the red-green majority in Lower Saxony , the Federal CDU sees a general signal against coalitions of the Social Democrats and the Greens .	-7.5392
" This shows once again : Red Green simply cannot run reliably , " said CDU-Secretary-General Peter Tauber the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-3.7289
The surprise of a Green MEP has plunged Prime Minister Stephan Weil 's government into a serious crisis .	-4.2741
Five months before the country ’ s election , his red-green coalition thus lost its one-quarter majority to the CDU and FDP opposition .	-4.1313
The Federal Managing Director Michael Kelner has asked the downturns of Anglo-Saxon Green MEP Elke Tsungen to give back their mandate .	-6.3443
Moving over to the CDU means a clear distortion of the will to the electorate .	-4.1871
Elke Twalvest must return her mandate immediately , " said the Federal Commercial Director and campaign leader of the Greens to the German editorial network ( RND ) .	-5.9872
" This must not be true at all " , a SPD voter claimed , when the new HiobsMessage reached the party headquarters on Friday morning .	-7.9755
Stephan Weil , the SPD prime minister of Lower Saxony , is there after the passage of Green MEP Elke Tvest to the CDU without its own majority in government .	-5.8100
It is the preliminary highlight of a whole series of major and small crises in SPD national associations .	-3.6857
And no one knows what happens next .	-1.6402
The misery began with the unexpected marked defeat at the Saarland election in March .	-2.8353
A blue eye , no more , calmed down the comrades at the time .	-3.8846
Things will be different after the country elections in Schleswig-Holstein and North Rhine-Westphalia .	-3.1714
That became the case - and everything became much worse .	-4.0201
The defeat in Kiel brought the SPD into the Taumeln , which in Düsseldorf called the party smooth .	-4.9656
In the weeks after that , the comrades got to rub up again .	-6.7521
Then , when they had just guessed new courage , the Hamburg G-20 summit came .	-3.6367
And with him came the next low hit .	-2.2868
Mayor Olaf Scholz , the last strong leader of the SPD , lost his Nimbus this weekend because he sat in the Elbphilharmonie while his city burned .	-3.2919
And because , after that , he made almost everything wrong in crisis communication , what can be done wrong .	-5.6229
Since then , Scholz has been fighting for his political survival .	-1.5085
Now , then , Stephan Weil .	-2.2027
The Prime Minister of Lower Saxony has been criticised for some time now because of the Volkswagen offenses and his role in the Supervisory Board .	-6.3248
I received my poll numbers .	-2.8100
Nevertheless , or perhaps precisely because of this , it tried to focus more and more strongly in recent weeks .	-5.5176
The efforts of the former Mayor of Hannover to increase his power in Berlin were not hidden in the surroundings of Martin Schulz .	-4.7809
They granted him because they promised that the party would be stabilized by virtue .	-4.6048
The exact opposite could happen .	-2.9600
It is because the Dutch Greens are not really at fault in the party internal dispute .	-5.1441
Nor is Schulz at all .	-2.7289
For the time being , the Cooperatives are trying to keep their own ranks closed .	-3.9048
Their anger is directed at the Greens , and in particular at the breakaway Parliamentarians in the Twenties .	-5.2066
" It is unbearable and anti-democratic , as Mrs Twalvest places her own career interests above the interests of all others , " says Matthias Miersch , the leader of the party left in the SPD Bundestag , the editorial network Germany ( RND ) .	-6.3714
Mrs Tvest was elected to parliament not because of her person being a direct candidate , but on the Dutch Green national list , the Lower Saxony MEP continued .	-8.5684
The logical consequence would be for them to give back their mandate .	-2.7550
Thomas Opmermann , head of the SPD parliamentary group , deplores an ' undemocratic manoeuvre ' .	-3.8963
" The electoral will of four years ago was clear : the people made Stephan Weil prime minister , " says Opmerann , who leads the Lower Saxony SPD to the federal election , the RND .	-5.9607
" Now the personal career thinking of a future CDU member changes the election result , " Opponermann continued to say .	-5.1928
He called for the reasons to be clarified .	-2.2294
I want to know whether there has been more or there have been further commitments made by the CDU in Lower Saxony .	-4.3139
Aid to placemakers III	-4.2847
If you want to restore your house in the years , you can get help from the country soon .	-4.5792
On Wednesday , the mayor of Albert Schindler and three representatives of STEG Stadtsprung informed in Sensgen .	-5.9703
At the beginning of the information event , Schindler once again gave an overview of what happened so far .	-4.0085
Since 1991 there have been some redevelopment zones .	-4.7072
At that time , in the area of remediation I from 1991 to 2004 , the country of Baden-Wuerttemberg has taken over two-thirds of the total funding .	-7.3915
In the II rehabilitation area from 2005 to 2016 , the grant still stood at 60 % .	-3.8585
For Schindler the previous restorations are a " success project " - after all , it is important to promote the development of the interior and not only to open up new areas .	-7.1085
On April 4 , Karlsruhe ’ s government administration administration administration administration administration administration administration administration administration gave information that there will be a reconstruction area III .	-6.0664
The total funding was EUR 833 , of which EUR 500 000 would be received from the country , the rest of the municipality Sensgen .	-5.0810
How does a recovery area now arise ?	-3.7350
We will , as Schindler said , investigate where the " really old " houses are .	-4.4921
However , it also plays a role in recovering whether there is any interest in the planned area at all .	-4.8451
If necessary , the territorial boundaries could then be changed again .	-3.9755
The STEC represented on Wednesday evening Martin Keller , Gaby Pietzschmann and Sarah Gotzel .	-2.6414
Keller presented the contents of the Bund Country Program " Social City " , within which the sanctions would then be carried out .	-3.5400
At the heart of the programme is the revitalisation of urban areas , the improvement of living and working conditions and the maintenance and development of infrastructure .	-6.0387
The measures would be taken on an objective basis , i.e. per plot .	-3.5650
The sanitation area would then finally be defined as a statute .	-5.3110
Since 1 January 2017 , the allocation period for funding has continued until 30 April 2026 .	-3.7087
However , until September of this year , the inventory would be carried out , in which those involved in the recovery area would receive a questionnaire to fill in .	-7.1250
In November or December , the decision to coerce should be made as possible so that the sanctions can be started next year .	-6.4594
Pietzschmann then explained that each Commune must carry out the aforementioned prior investigation .	-4.0978
It is a matter of assessing urban grievances and deciding when is being renovated and to what extent .	-4.9102
A refill statement will then be added to the property .	-5.3071
Pietzschmann himself will come back to sensing and take a picture of the situation , she promised .	-4.5081
Gotzel stressed that a key success factor for the project is the participation of the participants .	-3.8527
That is why there will be questionnaires that will be sent to the citizens in the coming weeks and can be completed by the end of the summer holidays .	-5.1997
The yellow questionnaire is the " building and property statement " , which deals , among other things , with the building state and the plans for restoration .	-5.7461
In the grey questionnaire , the " household and housing questionnaire " , you can find information about the size , distribution and residents of a living room .	-4.8834
The blue " operating bow " shall only be completed if the premises of the building are operated .	-4.3118
However , it should be noted that Gotzel pointed out that a completed questionnaire is not simultaneously a request for funding .	-3.7785
In addition , new construction measures are not eligible .	-2.4006
Schindler further stressed that the distribution of the grants works according to the " greyhound principle " - who comes first , smiles first .	-5.4415
You cannot " reserve " any later aid .	-4.4071
In conclusion , photos of the project " Brieform II " were shown to make the presence tasty .	-7.6945
British inventors are using a microchip to get into the house and car with a handmove .	-5.3280
A British inventor is the first in the country to be equipped with a microchip to open his door , enter his office and even start a car with a single movement .	-4.5614
Steven Northam , 33 , had implanted the tiny chip between thumbs and pointing fingers and now offers the service for companies and individuals who want to simplify their life with technology through his company BioTeq .	-4.8314
He has joined Geoff Watson , a consultative hospital at the Royal Hampshire County Hospital in Winchester , Hants , to ensure that the implant is carried out according to medical standards .	-4.8926
The technology resembles a cat and dog implanted microchip and lasts only 30 seconds .	-2.4624
The company of Mr. Northam would also like to change the castles at houses and cars so that they are compatible with the chip , all for an additional charge of <unk> 300 per castle .	-4.3204
The married father of one has now installed both at home and at his BMW Z4 technology , which begins when his hand is driving .	-3.7013
White House promotional costs taxpayers thousands	-1.4549
The White House ’ s decision to fly a naval helicopter to South Lawn for an event that highlights American manufacturing last month will cost taxpayers up to $ 24,000 , according to the military ’ s information given to the TIME magazine .	-4.7551
The green-white Sikorsky VH-3D , known as Marine One when the president is on board , was the heart of the event on 17 July in the White House with American construction programs .	-3.5853
President Donald Trump , Vice President Mike Pence , and White House senior officials conducted a round of products from all 50 countries .	-4.1639
The helicopter , built in Connecticut , was presented alongside a yacht from Maine , a Wiscon fireman and a Mississippi forklift truck .	-4.8619
The White House military office demanded the presence of the helicopter in a fragmented order or FRAGO , barely 36 hours before the helicopter landed on South Lawn , according to the records of Marine Helicopter Squadron One ( HMX-1 ) , the unit responsible for operating the helicopter .	-4.0722
" I just wanted you to be aware of this because it is such an unusual event with high visibility , " wrote the captain of the HMX-1 on the eve of the event his superior , the deputy marine commander for aviation .	-4.7368
The news indicated that the helicopter arrived at the South Lawn at 3 p.m. on 17 July , until the lawn was cleared between 18 : 00 and 21 : 00 this evening .	-4.8100
The note adds that if the departure from the White House were delayed , a second crew would be needed for the return flight due to the restrictions of the hours .	-4.8648
The original flight crew was on the helicopter during the event , while the security personnel of the unit remained on the aircraft during the time .	-4.8550
The records provided by the TIME did not clearly indicate whether a second flight crew was required in the end .	-4.1045
The Hatch Act prohibits federal employees from using state property for political purposes .	-2.1891
Records indicate that HMX-1 asked if the event could violate the provision .	-3.1739
" One question we asked was whether this was a violation of the Hatch Acts and we were informed that this was not the case , " the commander wrote .	-3.4633
" Blast as if you were locked , " replied the deputy commander .	-3.6690
The " Made in America " event was called an official event by the White House and would not have been covered by the Hatch Act .	-2.6958
But official events also have political overtones .	-0.8213
At the meeting , the President gave impetus to the reform of the health reform that was underway in the Senate , and he promoted efforts to curb the rules of government .	-5.5851
The use of the aircraft known as the Marine One or Air Force One for purposes of political advantage is hardly a new phenomenon .	-2.6351
Presidents are obliged to use them for the trip .	-2.6185
But to demand their use only for a photo-OP is unusual .	-4.4388
Trump carried out an investigation in February , when the presidential aircraft provided taxi services against the background of his first campaign rally in Melbourne , Florida , and his Twitter account is full of messages complaining about the use of the presidential aircraft by his predecessor .	-5.3973
" The White House is thrilled by the show " Made In America " - showing products from all 50 states produced by American workers with American materials , " said the deputy press secretary of the White House , Lindsay Walters .	-3.5161
HMX-1 crews often carry out training flights in the area around Washington and South Lawn to replace the US president in the White House with precise centimetres .	-4.1611
When Trump was at the G20 summit in Germany in early July , HMX-1 conducted 58 exercises in the White House .	-2.2651
The flight for the " Made in America " event counted on the training requirement of flight crew for the month , said a civil servant .	-3.3590
Helicopter units additionally flew 11 hours a day for non-presidential support missions .	-4.2864
The White House said that taxpayers did not take the burden for any of the other acquisitions presented at the event .	-2.9901
A Speaker of Sikorsky said that the company was not involved in tracking the helicopter on the South Lawn .	-4.4258
HMX-1 does not have budget names for presidential flights , and it is difficult to determine the exact cost of the event .	-3.3637
According to hourly rates of the US Defense Department for the financial year 2017 , however , the DoD refund rate for VH-3D is $ 24.380 per hour .	-8.9369
The aircraft 's flight time was 30 minutes from the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico in Virginia .	-6.1309
The White House argues that the actual costs of operating the helicopter are well below this rate .	-2.0985
" The cost of taxpayers based on rates of reimbursement is highly misleading , " said Walters .	-3.7744
" These estimates include staff , maintenance and many other hidden costs included in the annual funds . "	-3.4907
According to a 2015 RAND study , the reimbursement rates for DoD do not include personnel costs , but take into account the costs of fuel , maintenance , and contract conclusion .	-3.3268
At that time , the former White House press spokesman , Sean Spicer , defended the helicopter for the event .	-3.9369
" The idea is to present things produced in America this week , " said Spicer .	-2.2761
" And I know that Sikorsky and the State of Connecticut are very proud to contribute to our national security , and I assume that hundreds , if not thousands , depend on it .	-2.9747
And I think , like most Americans , we are all proud of the helicopter and other military equipment that so many Americans have worked tirelessly for .	-2.2900
It is , of course , appropriate to emphasise this . '	-2.9681
It was not clear whether Trump interacted with the helicopter when he went round the South Lawn for the event , but he set himself in the driving seat of a fire-fighting car .	-6.1036
In the White House , Trump spoke to Sikorsky ’ s representatives and talked to the media about his own fleet of corporate products .	-3.5307
" I know Sikorsky very well , " the President said , " I have three of them . "	-2.2767
TC BW Neuss on Kniffreger Challenge	-7.8289
Leaders of the Second tennis Bundesliga will compete in the third striker SV table .	-6.1346
The TC Blau-Weiss Neuss will appear in Kiel tomorrow at the 3rd Sucksdorfer SV table at 11 o 'clock in . with and with , , , etc . , and . .	-10.3980
Despite five rounds , the top runner of the second Bundesliga tennis league still has a spotless record .	-6.7976
In any case , Team Chief Marius Zay has respect for the opponent .	-3.1619
" This is a compact team that always plays in quite a similar format .	-2.6621
I find the team very good at the rear positions . '	-4.3028
Class and stability of the Sucksdorfer SV provide mainly imports from the high North .	-7.3936
" Their Danes and Finns can even point to stakes in the Davis Cup .	-1.6005
And they are also strong in double ' , says Zay with a view to Harri Heliovaara ( Finland ) , Andre Göransson ( Sweden ) , Sören and Esben Olesen , Martin Pedersen and Andreas Bjerreanus ( all Denmark ) .	-5.7031
" That , as always , becomes difficult for us .	-2.8473
You also need a good portion of luck . '	-2.5474
The Neuser team for the trip to the high north is practical .	-4.3504
His debut for blue-white could give Maxime Janfour .	-1.7895
If the currently active Frenchman at the Challenger tournament in the Italian Biella does not become the Bundesliga match , the Zdenek Kolar ( Czech Republic ) playing at the Czech Liberec tournament will be the first time in this season .	-7.6250
Hans Podlipnik-Castillo , who has not yet been won , was still on the ball with the Belarussians Andrei Vasilevski at the ATP tournament in Kitzbühel .	-10.4162
However , he should be present in Kiel as well as Botic Van de Zanzhulp , Niels Lootsma ( both Netherlands ) and the Belgians Julien Cagnina .	-4.2134
After his two victories last Sunday against the club at the Alster , Máté Valkuz could also be back in the team .	-4.8824
If it is not enough for the 18-year-old Hungary , which was still the number one of the junior world rankings in January 2016 , someone from the trainee ’ s office around Marius Zay fills the cader .	-5.6590
How America Can harm OMV	-3.6033
Donald Trump was not really happy when he signed Wednesday ’ s law tightening sanctions against Russia .	-4.0114
" In his haste to pass the law , " Congress has packed a few " unconstitutional regulations " , he estimated .	-3.8411
The response from Moscow was as sharp as expected , and even Brussels was ashamed of the US push .	-2.9018
After all , the proposal provides for punishing European companies that help Russians build gas pipelines into the EU .	-3.3084
Meanwhile , investors from the domestic OMV have been worried about the construction of the Russian Baltic Sea Line Nord Stream 2 together with other European companies .	-5.7330
The drohscene is huge .	-4.1467
Nevertheless , it is too early to assess the consequences , according to the official statement of the oil company .	-3.8915
In fact , Donald Trump himself would have to bring the sanctions to life by an executive order .	-3.8781
Twelve weapons are at his disposal .	-2.2676

" The offer also applies to the 35-hour support if children stay until 14 " .	-4.7750
46 part-time workers have kitchen services from September 1st : they heat up the food delivered , supplement them with salad , raw food and fruit , carry out the meal individually , give the food out , clean and clean the kitchen .	-8.5602
" The employees are firmly associated with a kita , " says Pomeranz .	-4.7577
The size - there are two groups as well as seven group facilities - determines the scope of the hour .	-5.9812
" The female workers are now firmly in the kita-team , " says Pommeranz satisfied .	-4.6567
" Thus they are much more involved and it is easier for students to implement pedagogical concepts " .	-4.7831

This continuity is important for children .	-0.9772
The cleaning of the kita-rooms - so far also the task of the kitchen staff - will be carried out by special cleaning staff .	-4.7569
This variation - the separation of cleaning and kitchen service - besides the quality improvement of the kitchen performance also has the charm that it has proven to be the most economic for the city in terms of cost comparison between self-government and foreign awarding , it is from the press .	-7.9556
And that , although 46 part-time workers are being recruited .	-4.0114
" But these hours are not so important for some 750 people in the educational sector , " says Sonja Pommeranz .	-4.3866

According to police information , the men spoke at 14.55 p.m. to the 13-year-old who was with friends at the Kolping Street , because they wanted to make phone calls with the girl 's mobile phone .	-6.7452

GMB concerns about investments in the McVitie factory in Glasgow .	-2.3412
A trade union would like to check with Biskuit manufacturer McVitie about the long-term commitment to production at their plant in Glasgow .	-4.8671
GMB Scotland said that the company has concealed over the future of investment at the Tollcross site .	-3.1442
More than 500 employees work at the plant producing Hobbern and Rich Tea Kekse products .	-4.4546
McVities owner of Pladis said he has invested over GBP 5 million in recent years .	-3.6517
He added that workers and trade union representatives would " learn first " if their activities were to change .	-3.5436
In a letter to the company 's branch manager , GMB Scotland McVitie 's request that ' concern be expressed that the funding for the modernization of production lines is not pushed forward ' .	-5.7406
GMB-senior Organiser Drew Duffy , said : " The fact that we cannot gain clarity from the General Site Manager about the business needs and investment plans for the future of Tollcross is a matter of our members deeply .	-4.5914
Generations of families have worked here and the labour force has focused heavily on the local community and the Glasgow metropolitan area , an important pillar of decent employment in an area with high unemployment and social disadvantage .	-7.6827
That is why , under the prospect of jobs , wages and prosperity , and in the context of Brexit , the rising cost of living and the chronic decline in production , the eastern end of Glasgow urgently needs a flourishing production presence at McVitie .	-5.8336
A speaker at Pladis said : " The branch office at Tollcross received a letter from GMB Scotland only yesterday , and the company will respond directly to it because we appreciate the continuous commitment of employees and trade union representatives .	-5.1867
Two months ago , we had a regular meeting with staff and GMB representatives at Tollcross , where some issues were discussed openly .	-3.2490
We discussed with the staff that we , like all companies operating in an extremely competitive and insecure economic climate , are constantly checking our business - and this applies to all our business areas and sites - to remain competitive .	-5.8370
She added : " In recent years , we have invested over GBP 5 million in our Tollcross-site , particularly in production lines and operational improvements .	-3.3823
We fully recognise the heritage of Tollcross as a production site , and if our operations are changing at the site , staff and trade union representatives will be the first to know this . '	-5.9433
Did the PSG Barcelona warned against Neymar three years ago ?	-2.7413
The side of La League may regret her interest in Marco Verratti .	-2.8811
Paris Saint-Germain will not let down in her persecution of Neymar , after submitting an offer of <unk> 189 million to trigger its clause , but have they warned Barcelona three years ago of the World Record fall ?	-6.2529
The sensational approach has fueled the transfer window in summer , because the Ligue 1 club is ready to break the world record by more than twice the previous brand , with Paul Pogba returning to Manchester United last season for 89 million pounds .	-4.7283
After finishing , Neymar becomes the world ’ s most expensive player and the world ’ s highest paid professional athlete , PSG offers wages of more than GBP 500,000 per week .	-4.6021
Barcelona is angry about the way in which Neymar has forced his way out , although a source near the Catalan board insists that the club has always done its best to deal with him since his arrival from Santos in 2013 .	-5.1559
But was the football world warned of this prospect three years ago by the PSG president ?	-2.8337
When Manchester City expressed interest in signing Blaise Matuidi in 2014 , Nasser Al-Khelaifi had a strict warning for any club that wanted to sign one of the best players of PSG .	-3.0185
" I 'm not concerned because they know that if they touch one of our players , then we will be in opposition to them , we will contact their players , " said Al-Khelaifi .	-3.3854
" We respect all clubs .	-0.9945
But if they try to sign one of our players , they will have consequences . '	-4.0227
Barcelona seems to have crossed that line , with the Spanish club expressing interest in the PSG midfielder Marco Verratti at the beginning of this summer .	-4.2398
PSG made it clear that it would not allow the International from Italy to leave under any circumstances , and Barcelona could feel the consequences of this interest by losing one of its price offers for Neymar .	-4.4534

In the surroundings of Stolzenau , a passenger car faced him in his lane so that he had to depart to the right .	-6.3680
In doing so , the Touran driver was touting the Leitplanke .	-5.5474
Material damage was caused by the car .	-5.5387
The driver of the front passenger car , a Mercedes Benz , had overtaken a lorry and continued his journey without taking care of the traffic accident .	-9.1663
According to the accident accident accident accident , it may be good that the Mercedes-Benz did not even notice the accident .	-5.0264
The police are now asking the witnesses of the incident and the driver of the polluter pays vehicle to contact the Commission in Stolzenau , Tel . 05761 / 92060 .	-5.4950
Interview : ' Domspatzen report relieves Pope Georg Ratzinger '	-2.9954
The Regensburg Cathedral Report on the cases of abuse relieves Pope brother Georg Ratzinger .	-4.1074
This means author and historian Michael Hesemann .	-2.2680
The final report on the abuse scandal at the H<unk>tel Regensburg continues to hold discussions .	-5.3037
Christian Weisnder , spokesman of the reform movement " We are Church " , explained after publication to the German press agency , he expects an apology from the former Regensburger Bishop and today Cardinal Gerhard Ludwig Müller , as well as from the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger , the 93-year-old brother of the emeristic Benedict XVI .	-5.9083
It would greatly serve the reputation of the Catholic Church if Müller and Ratzinger expressed their deep regret at their own omissions or their false assessment of what happened at the time .	-4.6758
The Vatican Chancellor , on the other hand , criticized " Osservatore Romano " for measuring violence in domains with " double standards " .	-4.6143
With regard to the attacks in Regensburg , no one is in doubt that it is a case of ' shameful and shameful acts ' that should be punished and prevented in the future ; but it is striking that the ' degree of media manipulation ' , according to the author Lucetta Scararafia , historian and member of the national Bioethics Committee .	-8.0542
" The habit of calling the Catholic Church as a source of all ills is already part of everyday experience and prepares public opinion to consider this normal , " says Scarafia .	-5.1114
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis also said in the interview with Bayerischer Rundfunk : " You 're happy to get rid of the church and that is a bewildered lunch " .	-6.4283
In addition , she pointed out that in her youth " beatings were a very normal pedagogical means " to cope with cheeky children as I was one . "	-7.7482
It would be unfair to apply today ’ s standards to previous decades , for the world has changed .	-2.7903
In connection with reports on cases of abuse , Pope Georg Ratzinger often appeared .	-4.2780
Quite wrongly , the author and historian Michael Hesemann , who wrote the reminder book " My brother of the Pope " ( translated into 12 languages ) by Ratzinger .	-5.3279
" I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , " says Hesemann , " because all this had nothing to do with him " , he appreciates the results of the final report .	-3.4024
What exactly is the 44-page report presented by the lawyer , Ulrich Weber , commissioned by the Bishop Regensburg with the Enlightenment ?	-5.1558
The 547 Regensburger domes were sexually abused between 1945 and the beginning of the 1990s " with high plausibility " victims of assault , 67 domes .	-5.5158
The final report refers to Georg Ratzinger , who worked in Regensburg from 1964 to 1994 : " So it can be noted that in many cases , forms of physical and psychological violence were used by Domkapellmeister R.	-4.3174
The punishment for the students was even more intense with high emotion .	-5.0584
Nevertheless , unlike many other suspects , many victims value the general humanity of R. R. , and thus in many cases combine positive memories with him , despite violence .	-11.2499
In the interview , Hesemann explains why he believes that the final report on the abuse scandal at the Regensburger Domsputz Georg Ratzinger is relieving the burden .	-6.9804
Mr Hesemann , the 440 page report on " incidents of violence against property owners at the Regensburg Cathedral Spaces " gives a contradictory picture of Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger .	-5.0382
On the one hand , many students emphasize their " humanity " .	-3.4548
On the other hand , he also appears to be a choler and perfectionist , who has become quite tangible on the other hand if a Domspetz didn ’ t bring top performance musically .	-8.5855
How do you , as your biographer , value this final report ?	-3.6612
Michael Hesemann : If you take the trouble and read the whole 440 pages long report from the front to the back , you have to ask yourself why the name Georg Ratzinger is actually in .	-7.6195
He is just eight pages dedicated to him and he is clearly free from any suspicion of complicity or complicity in the terrible cases of sexual abuse .	-3.9186
The pre-school violence excesses were also outside its scope .	-3.4722
At best , he can be accused of being too late or of not being taken seriously enough initial suggestions .	-5.9459
The Domspatzengymnasium on which he worked was considered by practically all the respondents as " redemption " , " sky " and " better world " .	-5.8653
The vast majority of his students , Georg Ratzinger , also made a very excellent testimony , describes him as " warm " , " popular " , " sincere " , " competent " and " intelligible " , as an extremely well-tired teacher who regularly provided the boys with cakes , biscuits and bonbons , and " always surrounded by children 's grapes " .	-7.8589
Only a minority have complained about his perfectionism and his high emotionality , which has led to the breakup of .	-5.9549
He even admitted years ago , deeply regretted and apologized for the fact that he was not only slashing with stools and threw the key ring onto the floor , but also fed ear-pieces and pulled too naughty boys to the hair or ears .	-10.0282
To his rescue , however , it must be said that such educational methods were widespread in the period in question , the 1960s and the 1970s , with parents and teachers .	-5.2941
Do you also know such breeding methods ?	-1.5918
Of course , I think all of us born before 1968 .	-2.3095
I also experienced it in a secular school , a state high school .	-4.4922
Of course , these are petty compared with what this report is about , namely appalling sexual abuse and excesses at preschool .	-5.6233
One wonders if it is not related to his familiarity and his role as brother of Benedict XVI that many media had just crashed on him .	-5.9275
Many who have never understood the Bavarian Pope are still working diligently .	-3.2552
The truth , however , is that the report relieves Georg Ratzinger in every respect .	-2.7590
Much has been reported in the media about abuse in the district of Regensburg .	-4.2856
Will Georg Ratzinger also be charged with any involvement or complicity in sexual abuse in the final report ?	-3.3713
Michael Hesemann : Absolutely no .	-1.3790
Not one of the 67 victims of sexual assault claims to have entrusted himself to the dome cap .	-5.4046
Not even the parents were inaugurated .	-1.9910
" I never dreamed of talking about it with my father or my mother , " said an injured deputy for the others , " It was all very embarrassing to me " .	-5.6543
The real problem with sex abuse was and is that most victims are silent in shame .	-4.2827
If they did not even familiarise themselves with parents and siblings , then they would certainly not have been a leader of the choir who would have been , to a certain extent , a colleague of the perpetrator professionally .	-7.1551
How do the Domspatzen-Schüler Ratzinger 's role in the cases of abuse evaluate ?	-5.9856
Michael Hesemann : A student asked it so : " For sexual abuse ... I see ... no case in which he ( Georg Ratzinger ) had had had timely findings and could have stopped the respective perpetrator .	-6.8681
I also think it is really absurd to think that he has , of all things , opened up to him ... Buben more intrusive or clearer or even more , than to her parents , boarding directors , teachers for trust , etc .	-8.7994
That you talk to him about sex ... - unthinkable ' .	-2.7430
The report therefore comes to the very clear conclusion : ' It was not possible to confirm that the pupils concerned and / or their environment were entrusted to him in the course of the investigation ' .	-6.5754
So , as far as sexual abuse is concerned , Georg Ratzinger is free of any complicity .	-3.7945
Nor can he be accused of not obstructing or exposing him .	-3.9863
Therefore , there is no reason to link his good name to these offences , as unfortunately happened in some cases .	-4.8722
Much has been read in the media about " excesses " of Regensburg Cathedral .	-4.2227
The former Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger is accused in the report " Wegblick " .	-3.9450
Does he have to live with this accusation ?	-1.8150
Michael Hesemann : This is the big problem that everything has been mixed up and mixed into a huge Melange of sexual abuse and violence excesses and somewhere in the middle of it , Georg Ratzinger .	-4.2735
Yet that is , in turn , an abuse of the report .	-3.9382
There is a clean separation : between the preschool and the high school of domes , between sexual abuse and violence excesses , as well as , say , other allegations .	-6.5031
The report also deals with incidents from the time since 1945 , also from four decades in which Georg Ratzinger was not the Choir Head of Domspasets .	-5.8712
All the terrible caning education , the cases in which the knees of sadist teachers have been systematically harassed and maltreated , and which have suffered horribly , have all occurred at the primary school in Etterzhausen and Pielenhofen , where truly scandalous conditions have had to prevail .	-9.3172
But the Domkapellmeister Georg Ratzinger had nothing to do with them , for he was only able to see the boys when they were already at the Domspatzengymnasium .	-5.8157
At that , as most of the witnesses emphasize , was the subject of " primary school " taboo .	-4.2713
You were only lucky to have escaped and could enjoy so much better treatment and for many even " paradise " conditions .	-4.7399
What was different at the Domspatzengymnasium ?	-3.0604
Michael Hesemann : There was already discipline , but not sadistic violence .	-2.7947
This also applies to Georg Ratzinger , where the report concludes that ' many victims value the general humanity of R. R. R. , and therefore in many cases combine positive memories with him , despite violence . '	-5.6914
So at most there is still a charge to have looked away .	-5.4679
However , despite all the efforts , the report could only define two periods in which it was reported by the preschool conditions .	-4.6310
The first time in 1970 / 71 , when he started to establish himself and did not want to hear about what was happening at a school where he was not working and responsible ( so the witness ) , and then back in 1993 .	-6.8643
Does Georg Ratzinger consistently close his ears before the state ?	-3.9301
Michael Hesemann : No , because in 1989 he wrote a letter to the director of the Cathedral high school , which the report even reproduces .	-3.5851
In his report , he points out that ' caning continues to be practised at primary school ' .	-6.6268
Even in view of the danger of negative press releases , he recommended urgent intervention .	-3.5455
This was , of course , at a time when there was legal clarity when caning penalties were long banned in Bavaria .	-4.0799
Before that , they took place in a legal grey area , as everyone knows .	-2.7644
He was also hard to assess where those affected may have been exaggerated or dramatised and where the permitted limit had really been exceeded .	-5.9513
It cannot be said , however , that he always looked away .	-3.7545
That is simply not true .	-1.3847
It was only in 1980 that the practice of caning schools was officially abolished in Bavaria as well . and were .	-4.0101
Prince Gloria of Thurn and Taxis claimed that it is unfair to apply today 's educational standards to those of that time .	-4.1444
How do you see this ?	-1.3938
Michael Hesemann : We historians talk about the " fallacy of anachronism " , that is , the danger of judging past by moral standards today .	-4.9608
The Princeton is right .	-3.6033
But this does not , of course , apply to sexual abuse , which was disgusting at all times and not to what was born in the pre-school of antagonism and violence against innocent children 's souls , which goes far beyond what happened then .	-7.4385
That is all very terrible and I am glad that it is finally being worked out .	-4.2220
But at the same time I have to protect Georg Ratzinger , because all this had nothing to do with him .	-2.5940
His means of disciplining and punishment , in other words , pulling ear and hair and ears , were widespread in the 1970s .	-5.0862
When physical punishment was then banned , he also kept strictly to it .	-5.1632
Which image of his Regensburg period has Georg Ratzinger reproduced in the discussions with you for the book " My brother of the Pope " ?	-4.9406
Is the issue of caning also raised in the language ?	-4.4736
Michael Hesemann : Well , in the book it is about the life of his brother Joseph , hence Pope Benedict XVI , tells from his perspective , because the domes played only a minor role .	-5.0472
Nevertheless , I do not at all hide the fact that he led a strict regime there .	-4.3196
But this also needs to be said : without this perfectionism , without the demand for unconditional discipline , it would have been impossible for him to make an institution of global standing , true European cultural ambassadors and his musical tradition , which went on tour twice in the US ( 1983 and 1987 ) and Japan ( 1988 and 1991 ) .	-7.8325
With Keksen and Bonbons alone , you don ’ t even make a big singer and success out of unsuspecting boys , regardless of where you are , but always discipline , passion and overcoming yourself .	-10.5254
What kind of person did you see Georg Ratzinger during the discussions on her book ?	-3.7888
Michael Hesemann : Through the work on the book and beyond , I really got to know Georg Ratzinger very well and again experienced as wonderful , humorous , grounded , deep in believing and good people , from whom one cannot imagine that he could do just one fly .	-8.8059
I regularly get to know how many former domains still today , 23 years after his emulation , keep regular contact with him , visit him , read him - he is almost blind - and treat him as a member of her family .	-4.9913
So those who still do not forgive him for being strict with them are clearly in the minority .	-3.3718
Most of his domains are grateful to him today for enriching his life and bringing the world of music to them .	-4.9708
And that he was always a good , vätterlich teacher - a strict father , certainly , that may be - but he was also a gracious cacophony of respect to which they still look up today and which they reverted .	-8.7971
I would also like to make it quite clear once again that everything that is suggested to him is methods of education , which were the order of the day .	-6.7916
We can be glad that we have overcome this time for a long time .	-3.6698
But it is highly unfair to turn a man just because he is prominent and has an even more prominent brother to the media scapegoat .	-3.2436
That is all too obvious the evil intent behind it .	-3.1125
The report that has just been published relieves it .	-2.8853
Now , the decency , a 93-year-old man who has gained great merit and who , without anyone else outside Bavaria and perhaps even Germany , would probably know about the Davos Domspats , would finally be in peace .	-9.5996
