The US should double Artificial Intelligence spending	-2.3053
As China becomes more active for artificial intelligence , the US should double its investment in research , says Kai-Fu Lee , Investor , and AI-Practitioners working for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-3.4972
These demands came about after US government announcements made to AI , even though the US lacks a formal AI strategy .	-3.8516
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 it will be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-3.4060
“ A doubling of spending on AI research would be a good beginning , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is about to come , ” said Lee .	-4.6583
Doubling funding could double the chances of achieving the next achievement in the field of artificial intelligence in the US , said Lee CNBC in an interview this week . , , but , , and .	-6.6088
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the new world order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , is CEO of Sinovation Ventures , a company that has invested in one of China ’ s most famous AI firms , Face + .	-4.0096
In the 1980s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on a AI system that defeated the highest ranking American Othello player , and later led Microsoft Research and President of Google ’ s branch .	-7.3753
Lee has recognized the US government ’ s previous technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Agency ) , and asked when the next one would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-4.7282
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain government subsidies , ” Lee said .	-2.3596
“ Not China is responsible for outflows of established scientists , but companies , ” Lee noted .	-3.8270
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have in recent years hired university luminaries to work on AI .	-3.3877
Lee said that a changed immigration policy could also help the US strengthen its AI efforts .	-2.3357
“ I think Green Cards should be offered doctoral candidates in AI automatically , ” he said .	-3.0787
In July 2017 , the Chinese Council presented its next generation artificial intelligence plan ( Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan ) .	-2.5591
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions like the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , Lee said .	-4.2093
Earlier this year , the United States has established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center , which is to involve partners from industry and science , and the White House has announced the formation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-4.5673

Macedonia votes in a referendum on whether to change the country 's name .	-2.5209
On Sunday , the people of Macedonia voted in a referendum on whether their name should be changed to the Republic of Northern Macedonia , a step that would resolve a decades-old dispute with Greece , which had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-4.7332
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that its northern neighbour 's name is a territorial claim on the Greek territory , and has vetoed the country 's entry into NATO and the EU .	-3.6706
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of Macedonia 's Slavic majority population .	-2.9437
President Gjorge Ivanov said that he would not vote in the referendum and , in the face of a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the outcome will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the validity of the referendum .	-4.5311
The question on the ballot paper was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.7766
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth the price of continuing integration into institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries that is to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.6459
“ I have come today to vote on the future of the country ; it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.7563
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said that they will adhere to the result of the vote so that it becomes crucial .	-3.6330
The name change requires a two-thirds majority in Parliament .	-1.7442
The Land Election Committee said at 13 p.m. that there were no reports of irregularities .	-4.1606
But the turnout was only 16 % – the figure was 34 % at the last parliamentary election in 2016 , and 66 % of registered voters cast .	-5.3798
“ I went for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.2968
Macedonia 's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and his son Dushko have cast their vote in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on the change of the country 's name , which would pave the way for accession to NATO and the European Union in Stratica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-4.0830
Before the parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and put chairs before the tents set up by those who are going to boycott the referendum .	-3.2926
" We are for NATO and the EU , but we want to participate with the heads up , not by the door of service , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.3898
“ We live in a poor country , but also we have our dignity .	-1.8521
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-3.6676
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investment to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-1.8386
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” Zaev said after giving his vote .	-3.5963
According to him , the “ yes ” result would be a “ confirmation of our future . ”	-4.1591
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Political Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would vote – less than necessary .	-3.0304
Another survey carried out by Macedonia 's Telma TV found that 57 percent of the respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.8334
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said they voted ‘ yes ’ .	-3.1449
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout for the elections is over 50 % .	-2.8617
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since taking office in May last year .	-2.8201
Remembrance : Sergio Agüero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on the way to the gate .	-4.3890
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling completed Brighton ’ s defense at Manchester City-2 victory on Saturday at Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-4.4821
Aguero left his hit at the 65th minute incredibly easy .	-3.0605
At the beginning of the sequence , the Argentine striker received a pass in the middle field .	-4.3119
He asked three defenders of Brighton to join .	-4.6830
Then Agüero saw himself surrounded by three greens .	-2.9622
He surrounded a defender before running several players on the edge of the Brighton Penal .	-4.8159
Then he left a passport and transferred to Sterling .	-3.1007
The English striker used his first contact to play the ball back to Agüero , who then shot with the right – past Brighton-goalkeeper Mathew Ryan in the right side of the goal .	-4.7189
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said CityManager Pep Guardiola to the reporters .	-2.2920
“ We talked about it ; he played 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.1691
That has happened .	-1.1396
Fortunately , he shot a gate at the moment . ”	-2.4570
But it was Sterling who first led the Sky Blues in the Premier League-Duell :	-3.5201
The Gate came at the 29th minute	-2.1795
In the game Aguero was played the ball deep in the territory of Brighton .	-2.0978
with a nice steep pass on Leroy Sané along the left side .	-3.2284
Sane made a few touch before he led Sterling to the post away .	-3.8295

Scherzer wants to play Gambling Against Rockies	-3.7140
Since the national player was excluded from playoff competition , there was little reason to force another start .	-4.1919
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are Playoff implications for the Rockies that have a lead from a game ahead of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-4.9281
Rockies secured at least one place ahead with a 5-2 victory over the Nationals on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not certain .	-5.0751
" Even if we play for free , we can at least put ourselves in order , because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best that we have to offer this year .	-4.4048

Nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to throw scissors in such a situation .	-4.4698

The Labour Party is no longer a broad municipality .	-1.5496
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-0.8854
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticize me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.3190
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour MEPs who say that we are not welcome - just because we said our opinion .	-3.7059

The communication on Friday for the East Labour in Nottingham states : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-3.0282
Most of my time in the eight years as a local Labour Member was exactly the same for the GC meeting on Friday evening .	-4.5054
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , softer ' policy has long been forgotten , if it has ever begun .	-3.9322
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and each opinion is judged to be acceptable to party leaders .	-4.4314
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s term of office , because those colleagues with whom I had previously thought I would have a similar political attitude expected me to take a U-turn and adopt positions that I would never otherwise have agreed with , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-6.7223
Whenever I make a public speech – and it does not matter what I say – there is a tirade of abuse in the social media , which calls for diselection , denounces the Centre ’ s policy and says to me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-10.3380
This experience has not only been my experience .	-2.6888
I know , in fact , that there is more luck than some of my colleagues because the comments that are directed at me tend to be political .	-4.5190
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are exposed to a flood of sexual or racist abuse every day , but never shy away .	-6.4157
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is how the level of abuse has normalized .	-2.5535
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.2280
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and the party will be smaller by any motion of censure or amendment of the selection rules .	-4.5804
I have received a lot of advice over the last two years to pull my neck , not to be so loud , and then I would be “ right . ”	-4.6543
But for this reason I have not come into politics .	-2.5433
32 years ago , as a student , I joined Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher government , which caused my classroom to collapse literally , so I tried to do better public services for those who need it most , no matter whether as a community council or minister .	-6.3899
I have never hidden my political views , even at the last election .	-2.4943
As far as my political positions are concerned , no one in Nottingham East should have been in any way confused ; the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-4.0763
To those who supported the request on Friday , I would simply like to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and to the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that is detrimental to households , businesses and public services .	-4.4589
But the only message I have is not that of Nottingham Momendum , but of my constituents , whether Labour members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not hold any threats to diselection or political opportunity from work in what I think is the best interest of all of you .	-6.0160

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr whisked at the top .	-5.3839
Two late tries may have distort the end result , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennant 's Premier Match of the day .	-4.2894

Robyn Christie of Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have made better use of their opportunities . ” , , , , , , , , , , ,	-3.7466
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , edited by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forward , but made a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain , Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to let numbers speak , and Jason Baggot an untimely attempt to make .	-6.3219
Climo carried out the leadership of Ayr with a punitive attack before reaching a match right to the midway and then making a solo such that he was able to perform in the 17 : 5 hour run for Ayr .	-9.8870
However , Melrose started the second half well , and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform Baggot reduced the amount to five points .	-5.4611
After restarting , Ayr continued to pursue the running as a try of Stafford McDowal-by Climo .	-7.7084
Ayr 's latest captain , Blair Macpherson , then got the yellow card , and again Melrose let the extra man pay with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt to end a curse of intense pressure .	-5.7445
However , the home page came back , and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card because of a tickling without ball from Climo from the penalty line , MacPherson made a touchdown , the forerunner Ayr in his back .	-6.5454

Throughout fully integrated Bolivia , memory of a coastline lost to Chile in a bloody resource conflict in the nineteenth century is still alive – as is the yearning to return to the Pacific .	-4.7630
These hopes may have been at their peak for decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment from the International Court on 1 October after five years of discussions .	-6.5947
" Bolivia has the dynamism , the spirit of unity and serenity and naturally expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-2.9198
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country and hope that the Tribunal in The Hague will find Bolivia 's claim for preference that , after decades of peaceful talks , Chile must negotiate to grant Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-5.1516
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic indigenous president – who is facing a contentious struggle for re-election next year – a great deal depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-3.8640
“ We are on the verge of recovering access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he vowed at the end of August .	-2.6613
Some analysts , however , consider it unlikely that the court will decide in favor of Bolivia , and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about change .	-4.4466
The Dutch UN body has no power to grant Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.6460
The decision of the International Court of Justice only came about six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , said Paz Zárate , an Chilean expert on international law .	-7.5295
Far from advancing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years could have postponed it .	-3.0769
“ The issue of sea access is being used by the current Bolivian Government for its purposes , ” Zárate said .	-2.8360
Moral belligerent rhetoric has destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , she proposed .	-2.3583
Bolivia and Chile will eventually resume negotiations , but it will be difficult to continue the talks afterwards .	-3.0325

Very uncomplicated hats have swung Instagram this summer , and these designers have sent their conspicuous creations over the catwalk .	-5.7556
Valentino ’ s most outstanding piece was an overblown beige , embellished with a spring-like edge that flooded the heads of the models .	-5.6499
Other superdimensional accessories were watermelons with jewellery , a magic guard and even a pineapple , but they are not designed to keep the head warm .	-5.0971

Independent schools in Scotland have a track record of top academic quality , which has continued with outstanding results in 2018 , including individual and group success in sport , art , music and other Community activities .	-6.5007
With over 30,000 students throughout Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , strive to provide the best service level to their students and parents .	-3.4134
Independent schools are designed to prepare students – for further education , including at universities , for their desired career path , and for their role as a citizen of the world .	-5.3440
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , and we note that modern languages in schools are still popular and desirable .	-5.4067
Nelson Mandela once said this : “ If you speak with a person in the language he understands , you reach his mind . ”	-3.8249
When you speak with him in his own language , he gets to his heart . ”	-3.3324
This shows impressively that we cannot rely only on the English language if we are to build relationships and trust with people from other countries .	-4.1755
The examination results this year show that languages are at the top of the tables with the highest number of established names in independent schools .	-5.0384
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached Higher grade A .	-3.0376
The data collected by the 74 member schools of the SCIS showed that 72 percent of students reached a Higher grade A in Mandarin , while among the students who learned German , French and Spanish , the grade A was 72 , 69 , and 63 .	-5.7949
This shows that independent schools in Scotland will promote foreign languages as essential skills that children and young people will undoubtedly need in the future .	-3.0085
Language courses in independent schools and elsewhere have the same rank as MINT subjects ( mathematics , information technology , science and technology ) .	-4.5054
A 2014 British Employment and Qualifications Commission survey found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling jobs were attributable to a lack of language knowledge .	-4.5652
Therefore , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-2.4877
These capabilities are essential in a globalised world , given more promising employment opportunities that language requires .	-4.7837
Regardless of the career that someone chooses if he has learned a second language , he will have a real advantage in future with a lifetime capability like this .	-4.4661
With the ability to communicate directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of competitors .	-2.5917
According to a YouGov survey with more than 4,000 adults in the UK in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to have a conversation , and French is the only language spoken with a double-digit percentage , which is 15 % .	-3.6505
That is why today ’ s investment in language teaching is important for today ’ s children .	-2.6188
When children learn to speak several languages – particularly those of developing countries – they will later have a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the labour market .	-3.7412
The schools in Scotland differ in their language supply .	-3.3483
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while other languages that are most important for Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese , will be taught .	-4.0100
Whatever your child is interested , there will always be a number of languages in independent schools , with teachers specialized in this field .	-3.7100
Independent schools in Scotland want to offer a learning environment that is well prepared for children , and to be given the necessary tools for their success , whatever the future may bring .	-5.9994
In today ’ s global business , languages remain undeniably important for the country ’ s future , and that must also be reflected in education .	-3.4625
Indeed , modern languages should really be regarded as “ international communication skills . ”	-2.2427
Independent schools will continue to offer this choice , diversity and top quality to young people in Scotland .	-2.3388

President Donald Trump begins tonight in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-3.3980
It is the first of five planned election events in the next week , and during his tour Trump the Republican Tennessee and Mississippi .	-6.9793
While his candidate ’ s confirmation for the vacant Supreme Court is pending , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the upcoming midterm elections , otherwise there is a fear that the Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-5.5231
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye tonight and how can they be viewed online ?	-2.3339
Trump ’ s Rallye in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 19 : 00 this evening , Saturday , September 29 , 2018 .	-5.2792
You can follow Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye online via live stream to YouTube .	-3.1998
Trump will certainly respond to the hearings this week concerning allegations of sexual abuse against his candidate for the Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation in office , which must be carried out by the Senate , was postponed by at least a week until the FBI investigation was completed .	-5.8543
But the main goal of these election events is to mobilize the Republicans , to whom a decisive election will be held in November .	-5.4088
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters with the five election events next week to defend and enhance the Senate and House Republicans ’ majority .	-4.4331
“ The majority in Congress is first on the presidential agenda , so he is visiting as many states as possible on the eve of the start of the turbulent campaign season , ” said Reuters , a spokesman for the Trump campaign , which does not want to be named .	-5.7084
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , the election event that is taking place this evening at the Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania and attract the attention of the Pittsburghe media .	-7.9470
On Saturday , Trump West Virginia , the state he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016 , will visit this month for the second time .	-2.1953
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for West Virginia ’ s Senate , Patrick Morrisey , who is lagging behind in the polls .	-2.5056
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , political scientist at the University of West Virginia , said that it is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to improve his poll values .	-4.6446
Ryder Cup 2018 : Team USA is ready to fight to maintain hope for Sunday matches .	-4.0629
After three one-sided meetings , the Saturday afternoon games probably meant exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-4.1934
The vibrating pendulum is a free-standing sports concept that the players have interned , especially in competitions like this .	-4.4103
So where would they say the momentum is now ?	-1.7602
“ You had a six-point lead and now there are four , so I think we have a bit of momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he was back for the day . ”	-5.5182
Of course , in the advantage of 4 points , Europe is ahead of twelve others .	-4.9343
But Americans , as Spiith says , feel some wind in their sails , and there was much encouragement for them , not least the shape of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played the whole day together and each have three out of four points .	-5.4692
Spiegel has been superior from the outset and set an example .	-4.2504
These fuzzy cheers became louder when his round passed , he sent a decisive putt to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas fell 2 points after 2 games .	-8.3451
His joy over the putt on the 15th hole with which she won the game was such that it was thought that he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-5.0768
" You really have to focus and just worry about your own game , " said Spiith .	-5.6518
This is all that remains for each player .	-3.6061
18 holes to leave an impression .	-1.5326
In the last two days of the Ryder Cup , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spietwood and Thomas .	-4.0044
Europe 's strange but admirable couple is playing flawed and just doing everything right .	-4.2662
" Moliwood " was the only pair that did not reach a boarding on Saturday afternoon , but it also avoided the two at Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning .	-6.8775
This race , and the way their energy seems to flow from and out of this missed audience , makes them into the favorites on Sunday and when the sun passes over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who will seal a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-6.4768
Probably both at the same time at different holes .	-2.5797
Talking about a European victory is too hasty .	-3.2102
Bubba Watson and Webb Simpson made a short process with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious with his partner Alex Noren in the morning .	-2.7410
With a fery and two Doubles at the first nine of the Spaniards and the Swedes entered a hole from which they never came out again .	-5.1965
On Sunday there is no one helping you out of your hole .	-2.7775
Due to the interactions between the pairs , the given advice , the ungiven advice and the way a strategy can change in the blink of an eye , it is very fascinating to see the Fourballs and Foursomes from close range .	-6.8321
Europe has played better than its team so far and has taken on a clear lead in the last day , but this Four Session has also shown that the US team is keen to fight , and some , especially Stateside , have questioned .	-8.3568
Europe is running 10-6 at the Ryder Cup Finalag	-3.1696
Europe will have a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup , having emerged from the four and four matches on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States .	-5.0507
The inspired duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to score four points in the Le .	-4.4836
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who fought for the preservation of the trophies that she lost in Hazeltine two years ago , dominated a team of American fighters fighting with exiles and won the series with 3-1 .	-6.5767
The US offered more resistance in the fourth and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-3.5575
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the Sunday ’ s 12 individual matches to keep the trophies .	-4.3356
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four consecutive points while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend called " Molliwood " , are only the second couple who wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.6438
After dismantling Woods and Patrick Reed in the Fourballs , it was considered certain that they would beat a cowshed Woods and the American Rookie Bryson Dechameau with an even clearer 5 & 4 .	-5.7398
Woods , who had spoken through two games on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he lost 19 of his 29 plays in four or four plays and seven in a row .	-7.0656
Justin Rose , born for the murder of Fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and beat in a 2 & 1 defeat by Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – one and three in the world .	-5.3969
At a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , however , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.5699
Three major league players Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-3.8549
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniards Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourth pack and returned later to knock Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the fourth pack after they lost the first two holes .	-4.6256
Only twice in the Ryder Cup story , a team returns from a four point deficit to the singles , although Holder Furyk 's site only needs a draw to keep the trophies .	-4.4674
After two days of second time , however , a Sunday counter looks as though it would go beyond it .	-4.4744
North Korea says that there will be “ no ” a unilateral disarmament without trust .	-2.4387
North Korea ’ s foreign minister told the United Nations on Saturday that continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that the country would certainly not unilaterally abandon its nuclear weapons in such circumstances .	-3.5040
Ri Yong Ho said the world ’ s annual general assembly that last year North Korea took " major goodwill measures " , such as stopping nuclear and missile tests , dismantling the nuclear testing facility , and committing not to propagate nuclear and nuclear technology .	-6.8701
" However , there is no corresponding answer from the USA " , he said .	-3.2398
“ Without any confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no possibility that we will disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-3.8897
While Ri revisited the well known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s opposition to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization , in which North Korea would be rewarded with gradual steps , his statement seemed significant in that it did not completely oppose unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.8562
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong-un and Donald Trump at a first summit between a US acting president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to working towards a " de-nuclear of the Korean Peninsula , " while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea 's security .	-5.0932
North Korea has planned a formal end to the Korean War in 1950-53 , but the United States has said that Pyongyang must first abandon its nuclear weapons .	-3.0901
Washington has also resisted calls for a relaxation of the harsh international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.6022
The US insists on " denucellarization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases the pressure by sanctions to achieve its purpose in a compelling way , and even reject the " explanation of the end of the war " , said Ri .	-5.6057
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-3.0622
But the problem is that continued sanctions exacerbate our distrust . ”	-2.2219
Ri mentioned no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US president had highlighted at the United Nations earlier this week .	-4.2366
Instead , the minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in over the last five months , and added : ' If the party were to be on this issue of denuclearization South Korea and not the US , denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have reached such a dead end ' .	-5.9444
Nonetheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year ’ s when he reported it to the United States . The General Assembly , targeting the US mainland with North Korea ’ s missiles , was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump called “ missile man ” on a suicide mission .	-4.9921
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened last year to “ completely destroy North Korea , ” praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that much work has yet to be done , and sanctions must continue until North Korea disregards denuclearization .	-4.6854
On Wednesday , Trump said he had no time to do so , saying : " It doesn 't matter whether it takes two years , three years or five months . "	-4.0989
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.3376
However , in the United States Foreign Minister Mike Pompeo said to the UN , the Thursday Security Council said that ' enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be pursued vigorously and without a shortage until we achieve full , definitive and verified denuclearization ' .	-6.0624
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea in order to prevent the financing of the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programs .	-7.0565
Pompeo met Ri on the outskirts of the UN General Assembly , and then said that he would return to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-3.4256
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip was not good .	-2.0954
He left Pyongyang in July , saying that progress had been made ; only a few hours later , North Korea condemned him for “ similar claims . ”	-4.0074
During a meeting with Moon this month , North Korea promised to dismantle a missile site and also a nuclear complex when the United States took the appropriate measures .	-4.7890
He said that Kim told him that the ' appropriate measures ' he sought were security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-5.9591
Harvard students participate in the course to find enough peace .	-2.5648
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of study of caffe-deprived " mixed nights " .	-4.8998
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often powerless to help themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-4.4831
Charles Cseissler , Harvard Medical School professor of sleep medicine and specialist at Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course he believes to be the first of his kind in the US .	-5.1110
He was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of a lack of sleep on learning .	-2.9859
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why are I told only now , in my closing year ?	-4.3365
She said that she never told anyone about the meaning of sleep – which surprised me ” , he told the telegraph .	-3.7191
The course , which is offered for the first time this year , explains to students how good sleep habits promote academic and sports performance and improve their overall . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-5.7534
Paul Barreira , Professor of Psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University Health Service , said that the university decided to introduce the course after it found that the students had been extremely low during the week .	-5.8556
The one-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-2.0706
In a section there is an image of a sleeping-hall where students click on coffee cups , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and about how sporting performance is affected by a lack of sleep and the importance of a sleeping time routine .	-5.9707
Another section explains how long sleep deprivation can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression , and cancer .	-2.1763
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to reflect on their everyday lives .	-2.4304
We know that it will not change students ' behaviour immediately .	-1.7651
" But we believe they have a right - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " added Prof. Czesler .	-3.6781
The culture of pride still exists , he said , and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on students and sleeping deprivation makes a growing problem .	-3.4885
Having enough sleep of good quality , the " secret weapon " of a student should be to fight stress , exhaustion and fear , he also said - not to accept , as sleep deprivation places the brain in famine mode and makes it constantly hungry .	-5.8302
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian who studied chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czesler design the course after visiting one of his classes in Harvard last year .	-4.0517
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to push a campus-wide course .	-2.8077
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all the doctrines to undertake a similar study programme before entering the high competition school .	-5.0281
Prof. Czesler recommended that students raise an alarm when to go to bed and when to wake up , and to be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can eliminate their circular rhythm , which leads to problems with sleeping .	-6.5455
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal erds Gerrards men	-1.6894
Forward problems of the Rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , a 1-to-0 defeat came in Livingston for the vast team of Steven Gerrard .	-5.8097
The team of Gary Holt , however , added Gerrards ’ second defeat in 18 games as coach , which left his team at eight points behind the disappointed Ladbrokes Premier Ship boss Hearts .	-7.1065
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the middle and an inspirational chart did not look as if she could bring about a settlement .	-7.6380
While the Rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston climbs to third only due to Tornus behind Hibernian .	-6.3463
New difficulties have arisen for the Rangers , because scheduled judge Calum Spence had to supply a head valve after being hit by a litter object – obviously cast out by the forward fans sector .	-7.6166
Gerrard made eight changes to his side , passing by Ayr and directly descended into the semi-finals of the Betfred Cup .	-7.2587
However , Holt placed the same Livi-Elf , who took a point off last week 's Hearts , and he should have been enthusiastic about how his well-trained team did not leave any room for action to the opponents at any time .	-8.5029
The Rangers dominated the ball , but Livingston better avoided opportunities .	-5.3152
They should have met after only two minutes , when Mengas first sent Scott Pittman to Allan McGregor 's Gate , but the midfielder forbid his big change .	-6.7880
Keaghan Jacobs went to captain Craig Halkett , but his defenceless partner Alan Lithgov was able to move far in the direction of the back posts .	-7.1890
The rangers took over control , but it seemed to give more hope than raffle into their own game , the last third .	-4.7439
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that having earned a penalty after he and Steven Lawless had collided , but referee Steven Thomson did not go to the appeals of Colombia .	-7.2076
The Rangers only have two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox Torkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly able to get out of the rest of Lassana Coulibalys head and the hit of a bisstic Ovie Ejaria .	-6.9349
Although Livi ’ s opening performance may have been at the 34th minute , perhaps contrary to the running of the game , nobody can deny that they earned it for their efforts alone .	-5.4800
Again , the Rangers failed to manage a Jacobs standard situation .	-2.9116
Scott Arfield did not answer when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball , preserving the calm and picking Menga for a simple finish .	-3.6286
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly against Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ranged from his line to block .	-6.3529
But Livingston has repeatedly pulled guests to play the very kind of game they like , with Lithgov and Halkett hanging for long balls .	-5.5852
Holts ' team could have extended their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor was well on his way to deny Jacobs until he left the corner .	-7.3295
The valet representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to a penalty because he got married to Jacobs , but he saw Thomson look out again .	-7.2808
Almanach : The inventor of the Geiger counter	-2.3147
And now a page from our Almapan “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger was born in Germany .	-4.7877
Geiger developed a method for detecting and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually resulted in the device known as a Geiger counter .	-3.0562
Since then , the Geiger counter has also become a mainstream of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which appears to be the improbable cowpoke scientist Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-5.1185
Man : " What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.6671
Rogers : “ It is a Geiger counter used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.2788
When you put these headphones up , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in minerals . ”	-3.0829
Evans : ‘ Tell me , but now it ’ s big ! ’	-3.1177
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , only a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.8617
But the invention that carries its name is still used .	-2.4003
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-2.4312
New cancer vaccine can teach the immune system to " look " and kill malignant cells .	-2.7112
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of treatment .	-1.8636
The procedure includes the extraction of immune cells by a patient , modification of the cells in the laboratory .	-3.2709
They can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then re-injected .	-3.0470
A study vaccine shows promising results in patients with a range of cancers .	-2.8260
A woman treated with the vaccine that accompanies the immune system to detect rogue cells saw their egg cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-3.5903
The method is to extract immune cells from a patient , change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” that occurs in many cancers , and then re-infect the cells .	-4.4839
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : " Our findings indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . "	-2.2724
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various forms of cancer ” , including breast , egg , lung and colorectal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.9159
A similar approach to taking patients immune cells and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-3.6478
After his performance on Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , dressed with a MAGA cap , made a pro-Trump tirade from the pile .	-4.3583
It did not go well .	-1.9255
During a Saturday Night Night live programme , Kanye West was launched in the studio after a rallying speech in which he praised the US .	-6.8981
After performing his third night song , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great hat , he stood up against the Democrats and reaffirmed his support for Trump .	-4.9188
" As often as I speak with a white person , she says , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-2.7409
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been out of America a long time ago , " he said .	-2.9496
The Saturday-Night-Live Show began with a sketch in which Hollywood star Matt Damon talked about Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement to the Senate ’ s Justice Committee about Christine Blasey Ford ’ s pretexts that Kavanaugh had sexually forced her to make fun .	-6.3879
Although it was not broadcast , the film was played by Wests Geschleicht by the comedian Chris Rock in the Social Media .	-6.2962
It is unclear whether skirt has tried to mock West with the contribution .	-3.1267
West also complained to the audience that he had had difficulty behind the stage because of his headgear .	-3.6641
" They pushed me behind the stage .	-1.4938
You said : ' Don 't go out with the hat ' .	-3.4921
You annoyed me !	-1.2654
And then they say that I am in a given place , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-1.9612
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would " attract my superman cloak , because that means you can not tell me what I should do .	-5.2957
Try it with love . ”	-1.4975
His comments were ordered by the audience at least twice and the comedians of Saturday Night Live appeared to be relocated , reported Variety and quoted a person in the words : “ The whole studio was dead . ”	-5.6864
West was later a substitute for the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-3.0328
West surprised many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , dressed as Perrier Bottle .	-2.3142
West received support from the head of the conservative TPUSA group , Candace Turner , who twisted : " This is for one of the most courageous ghosts : DASS DU DICH THE MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST " .	-6.8474
But Talkmasterin Karen Hunter twittered that West is simply " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-3.2158
“ But I will not reward anyone ( by buying his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , from which I believe he adopts and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-4.0759
It is free .	-0.7977
We also , " she added .	-1.9528
Before the show the rapper announced on Twitter that he had changed his name and now called the being formally known as Kanye West .	-3.6510
He is not the first artist to change their name and enter the footsteps of Diddy , also known as Puff Daddy , Puffy and P Diddy .	-3.2405

What is taught on television and on the street gives the little boy the feeling that they have to have this particular side of manhood ?	-4.0025

Conservative web sites like Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address that identifies the source of the sites was associated with Waters 's office and published the information of an employee of Waters reported Hill .	-4.5151
“ This unfounded reproach is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continued .	-3.3202
“ The employee among my employees – whose identity , personal information , personal data , and security were compromised as a result of these fraudulent and false claims – was in no way responsible for the accuracy of this information .	-4.7062
This unsubstantiated claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-3.6892
Waters ’ explanation quickly online criticised the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-4.5064
“ The fact that the matter is being denied is extremely annoying , ” he wrote .	-4.0772
“ This suggests that it is unsuitable as a member of Congress .	-3.3914
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.6183
You must not be suspensive .	-3.0433
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-1.3164
They must be calm and let . '	-3.1217
Mehrer seemed to compare Waters ’ response with Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused by critics of seeming rage during Thursday ’ s hearing .	-4.3871
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate running alongside the sedentless water in the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-3.9147
Big , if true , he has wedged .	-2.8359
Waters said in her statement that her office " informed the relevant authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-3.7848
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are apprehended and their actions , which have a destructive and dangerous effect on my employees , ” they continued .	-4.3212
Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.2928
It is a tradition in every new film with British tendency to look for Brexit memories , and this seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy Spoof Franchise , which started as early as 2003 with Johnny English and started in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-6.8180
Is ironic self-confidence about the mankind behind the scenes the nation 's new export possibility ?	-3.9845
In any case , the bellicose , gumming and incompetent Johnny English obtained the second license to re-massage things .	-7.0228
He is , of course , the silly secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims for smoothie glamour , received a bit of clouseau , a syringer Mr. Bean and a piece of that guy , and who has contributed a single note to the flagship book of the firefighters at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-7.9445
It is also based on the traveller and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once cooperated in the now forgotten BarclayBar television shows , always leaving chaos behind .	-6.7574
There are one or two beautiful moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.7914
I loved Johnny English who , in a medieval armor , approached a helicopter and briefly beats the main rotor against his helmet .	-3.7676
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strange superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands such as 007 and Mission Impossible self-consciously offer comedies as an ingredient .	-4.9263
The humor feels like it is directed at children rather than adults , and for me the crazy misfortunes of Johnny English are not so inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean films .	-4.6089
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-2.2244
A cyber hacker infiltrated the British highly secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , to the horror of the serving agent – an sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-5.1506
It is the last straw for a prime minister who is a pompous and contested personality and is already experiencing a complete meltdown of political unpopularity .	-4.7447
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , because every single active spy has been compromised , it has to bring someone out of retirement .	-5.5344
And that means , the rabbit Johnny English himself , who is now employed as a schoolmaster in a noble institution , but unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as a Undercover agent : some nice gags here , while English offers a School of Rock Academy about espionage .	-6.7389
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency war and reunited with its former , long-suffering Cuban Bough , again played by Ben Miller .	-5.2110
Bough is now a married man who meets with a submarine commander , an overtired , burschikos role in which Vicki Pepperdine is not entirely effective .	-5.4331
So , the Batman and Robin of the chaos at her Majesty 's Secret Service are back in action and meet Olga Kurylenkos 's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-6.2792
Meanwhile , the prime minister is dangerously under the charismatic tech billionaire who claims to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.4725
English and Bough begin their odyssey of the colourful Highjinks : As waiters , they ignite a French flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling luxury yachts on board Voltas ; and English solves pure anarchy when he tries to familiarize himself with a virtual reality headset with the interior of Voltas House .	-6.9219
For this last sequence , all the registers have certainly been drawn , but so loving and omitted it is also reminiscent of children 's television .	-6.2433
Quite wise .	-2.0267
And , as with other Johnny English movies , I have no choice but to think : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really does justice to his talent ?	-4.8495
Labour claims to have developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week , for which five days will be paid .	-3.0084
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is looking at a radical plan , with British working for only four days a week , but paid for five .	-4.2494
According to reports , the Party wants heads of companies to pass on the savings made by the AI revolution by giving them an extra day .	-3.8464
Staff would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money back home .	-5.1057
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plan to tilt the country for the benefit of workers .	-3.9799
The trade union congress has approved the conversion to a four-day week as a possibility for workers to use the changing economy .	-4.3914
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a policy review is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.2834
A four-day week target is one that coincides with the Group ’ s approach to restoring economic balance to the benefit of workers and the Group ’ s overall industrial strategy , but this goal will not be achieved overnight .	-5.9814
The Labour Party would not be the first to advocate such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during the 2017 campaign .	-3.0327
However , the entire Labour Party is currently not supporting this move .	-3.4446
A Labour spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.7565
Chancellor John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to flesh out his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.8784
Mr McDonnell said he was determined to recover the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profiteers ' among utilities .	-4.6128
The plans of the shadow Chancellor also mean that the water companies ' current shareholders may not get their full share back , because a Labour Government could make ' deductions ' due to supposed misconduct .	-7.2412
He also confirmed the plans to call workers into the management and create inclusive ownership funds to distribute 10 % of the equity capital from private sector companies to employees who receive annual dividends of up to <unk> 500 .	-5.3793
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their mind .	-3.4078
Following an ongoing FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh , the final vote on the appointment of the judge to the Supreme Court was postponed by at least a week , and the question is raised as to whether the investigation results of the Frepublican Senators could lead to renounce their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.9390
In an interview broadcast on Sunday , Scott Pelley , correspondent of “ 60 minutes , ” interviewed Republican Senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham about whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could induce them to change their mind .	-4.7279
Kennedy appeared more open than his colleague from South Carolina .	-1.7432
" Anyway , " Kennedy said .	-1.3538
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke with judge Kavanaugh .	-1.7457
I called him after that happens after this assertion came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-4.4270
He was determined , targeted , unequivocal . '	-2.5802
Graham 's voice , however , seemed to be carved in stone .	-2.5175
" I have an opinion about Brett Kavanaugh and it would need a bomb draft , " he said .	-2.7030
“ Dr. Ford , I don ’ t know what happened , but I know that Brett fought the charge vehemently , ” added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-4.3145
" None they called could confirm it .	-2.0352
It was 36 years ago .	-0.9043
I see nothing new that changes ' .	-1.7295
" What is the Global Citizen Festival and has ensured poverty is reduced ? "	-2.4064
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival will take place in New York , an annual music event with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.4567
On this year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival , tens of thousands of people will meet in Central Park at the Great Lawn to experience not only stars like Janet , Jackson Cardi B and Shawn Men , but also to draw attention to the true goal of the event : to end extreme poverty by 2030 .	-5.0619
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of Global Poverty Projects , an international interest group aimed at combating poverty by increasing the number of people actively against them .	-3.9618
In order to get a free ticket for the event , concerts had a whole series of tasks or " actions " , such as volunteer work , email to a leader in the world , a telephone call or another useful way of increasing the target of poverty reduction and raising awareness of it .	-7.2524
But how successful was Global Citizen with 12 remaining years to achieve his goal ?	-3.0479
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way to convince people to call for action , or simply another case of the so-called " clicktivism " - people who feel like making a real difference by signing an online petition or by sending an online application , or by doing so , a tweet ?	-9.4224
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” by its supporters pushing for a variety of goals .	-2.9799
It is said that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will affect the lives of over $ 2.25 billion by 2030 .	-3.6977
In early 2018 , the Group introduced 390 stakes and advisories from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid or financed .	-4.0594
The group estimates that the funds made available have had a direct impact on almost 649 million people around the world .	-3.2357
One of the most important commitments is The Power of Nutrition , a UK-based partnership of investors and executive organizations , which has pledged to “ help children develop their full potential . ” The organization has promised to help Rwanda , with $ 35 million , to end malnutrition in the country after Global Citizen ’ s more than 4,700 tweets received .	-7.0739
“ With support from the British Government , donor , other state governments , and global governments like you , we can cause the social injustice of malnutrition to be history one day , ” said The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman of the crowd at a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.4546
The group also said that , after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom , which sought to improve maternal and child nutrition , the government will reach the funding of the Power of Nutrition project for 5 million women and children with dietary interventions .	-5.3106
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website : “ Why do you think we can end extreme poverty ? ”	-2.4532
Global citizens replied : it will be a long and difficult road - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-3.3924
Like the big civil rights and anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed because we are more powerful together .	-3.1391
The stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will present at this year 's event in New York , moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-4.4583
US Navy forces could “ launch a blockade ” to impede Russian energy exports – Interior ministers .	-4.9059
Washington can use its navy , if necessary , to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Secretary of State Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-4.1414
Zinke argued that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria – particularly in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-4.4939
“ I believe the reason they are in the Middle East is this : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-2.7640
And according to officials , there are ways and means to deal with it .	-2.8758
" The United States has this ability to use our navy to ensure that sea routes are open and , if necessary , to block , to ensure that its energy does not come onto the market , " he said .	-4.6682
Zinke spoke to participants in an event of the Consumer Energy Alliance , a non-profit organization that calls itself the “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.9292
He compared Washington ’ s approaches to Russia and Iran , and found that they are actually the same .	-2.2485
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while calling Russia a " one-trial " with a fossil-fuel economy .	-3.8425
The opinions come while the Trump administration was on the mission to boost the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe , and to replace Russia , which is a much more favorable option for European consumers .	-4.6177
So members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are trying to get Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ captive . ”	-6.1465
Moscow has repeatedly stressed that the EUR 11 billion pipeline , Nord Stream 2 , which is intended to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project .	-3.0495
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply driven for economic reasons and an example of unfair competition .	-2.0410
“ I think we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Minister Aleksandr Novak , after a meeting with US energy minister Rick Perry in September in Moscow .	-6.2907
The US position has provoked a backlash from Germany , which has reaffirmed its commitment to the project .	-2.9946
Germany ’ s leading industrial organisation , the Bundesverband Deutscher Industrien ( BDI ) , has called on the US to stay away from EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.6242
" I have a big problem when a third state enters our energy supply , " said the Federal Association of German Industry ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-3.3006
Elizabeth Warren Will Take " Hard Look " At Running For President in 2020 , Massachusetts Senator Says .	-1.4880
On Saturday , Massachusetts ’ Senatori Elizabeth Warren said that she would seriously consider the presidential election after the mid-term elections .	-6.3461
During a Council meeting in Holyoke , Massachusetts , Warren confirmed that she would consider running .	-1.8529
" It is time for women to go to Washington and repair our broken government , and that includes a woman at the top , " she said , according to The Hill .	-2.3050
After 6 November , I will take a serious look at the presidential candidate .	-2.0434
Warren charged President Donald Trump during the Rakuthausmeeting , saying that he " is leading that country in the wrong direction " .	-6.4301
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.7420
Warren has not minced his hand in criticizing Trump and his Supreme Court , Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.5644
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : " Of course , we need a FBI investigation before we vote . "	-2.3544
But a survey published on Thursday showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-3.1446
According to a survey by Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 % of Massachusetts voters said that the senator should not stand .	-3.0926
Twenty-two percent supported such a run .	-1.5268
The survey showed more support for a run by former Governor Debal Patrick , 38 % for a potential run and 48 % against .	-3.8704
Other high-profile democrats , which are being discussed with a view to a possible candidacy in 2020 , are former Vice President Joe Biden and Vermont-Senator Bernie Sanders .	-4.3063
The Associated Press reported that Biden would officially decide until January .	-1.4793
Sarah Palin quotes Track Palins PTSD at Donald Trump ’ s campaign	-2.0465
Track Palin , 26 , spent a year in Iraq after he was called in September .	-1.7266
He was arrested and charged with an incident involving domestic violence on Monday evening .	-1.9823
“ I can understand other families who feel the effects of PTSD and some of the injuries our soldiers are returning to , ” she said to the audience at a rally for Donald Trump in Tulsa , Oklahoma .	-5.2073
Palin referred to his arrest as “ the elephant in the room , ” and said about her son and other veterans : “ They come a bit differently , they come back harder and ask themselves whether the work of their co-soldiers and the air force and all other members of the military is respected for the country . ”	-6.5810
He was arrested on Monday in Wasilla , Alaska , and charged for domestic violent attacks on a woman , disability of an ad for domestic violence and possession of a weapon in a defiant state , says Dan Bennett , a spokesman for the Wasilla police .	-5.3028
18 States , D. C. , support the challenge of a new asylum policy	-2.3669
18 states and Washington , DC support a legal challenge to a new US policy that denies asylum to victims fleeing gang or domestic violence .	-3.2367
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district of Washington on Friday submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) to support an asylum seeker in the law.	-4.6813
The full name of the plaintiff in the court case of Grace against sessions filed in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Law is not known .	-4.2235
She said that her partner " and his violent sons of gang members " had abused them , but on 20 July US officials refused to apply for asylum .	-3.7018
She was arrested in Texas .	-0.6769
The state lawyers who support Grace mentioned El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which comprise a large number of applicants for asylum in the US , as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-5.3980
The US ’ s new asylum policy has reversed a decision by the Immigrants ’ Chamber of Appeals in 2014 , whereby undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum .	-4.3295
The Minister of Justice of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in a statement on Friday that the new law ignored decades of international law .	-3.8616
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to federal law , all applications for asylum must be assessed in accordance with the circumstances of the respective lawsuit and such an approach violates this principle .	-5.5588
Lawyers continued to argue in the letter that the policy refusing entry to immigrants is damaging to the US economy , because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “ do what they need . ”	-5.1227
General Prosecutor Jeff Session instructed immigrant judges in June to stop providing asylum to people fleeing from home or gang lawyers .	-4.9214
" Asylum is for those who have to leave their country for persecution on grounds of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or political opinion , " said sessions in his statement on the law of 11 June .	-4.9355
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones that people face every day around the world .	-2.9958

US ambassador accuses China of “ bullying ” with “ propaganda . ”	-2.7504
One week after an official Chinese newspaper put a four-page display in a US newspaper on the mutual benefit of US trade in China , the US ambassador to China Beijing accused the US press of using propaganda .	-5.3869
Last Wednesday , U.S. President Donald Trump referred to China Daily 's paid allowance in the Foreign Moon Register - the state with the best-selling Iowa newspaper - after accused China of interfering in the US Congress elections of 6 November , which China disputes .	-6.4713
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of trying to interfere in the US election is a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to exert pressure on China .	-3.4372
While it is normal for foreign states to turn ads to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently engaged in an escalating trade war with multiple rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.8653
In an early period of trade war , Chinese and US experts have noted that China ’ s retaliation tariffs should hit US exporters like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-4.1351
Terry Branstad , American Ambassador to China and former Governor of Iowa , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing has hurt American workers , farmers and businesses .	-2.9415
China , Branstad wrote in an article of opinion in the The Moines Register on Sunday , “ is now vigorously pursuing this bullying in our own free press .	-7.0460
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid advertisement in the Moines Register , China ’ s government is exploiting the estimated American tradition of freedom of expression and press freedom , ” he wrote .	-3.9582
" By contrast , you will find limited dissenting voices at the newspaper stand in Beijing ’ s streets and see no real opposition to different opinions that the Chinese people might have about China ’ s disturbing economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-6.2620
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers opposed the offer for publication " , although he did not say which newspaper .	-3.6035
The Republicans grayed with the Kavanaugh debacle voters before the Midterm elections , warn analysts	-4.9663
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee to the Supreme Court , even though he was accused of sexual assault , warning analysts that they will see a counterattack in the forthcoming elections , particularly by women .	-5.3154
The emotions were high , most Republicans have already said they want to vote for him .	-3.0224
These things cannot be traced , Grant Reeher , professor of political science at Syracuse University ’ s Maxwell School , said on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-2.7376
Reeher said that he doubt that the last-minute support provided by Jeff Flake ( Republican MEP for the State of Arizona ) for investigations by the FBI is sufficient to reconcile angry voters .	-5.0806
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow , nor will it be in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior advisor and national spokesperson for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-4.6582
On Friday morning , the protesters sang : “ November comes ! ” while they marched in the Senate ’ s hall when the Republicans controlling the Justice Committee decided to proceed with Kavanaugh ’ s nomination , despite Dr Christine Blasey Ford , reports Mic .	-5.3648
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalist .	-2.6421
“ People say that it is quite advanced , that is true .	-2.8299
But the number could be higher , especially in pre-cities and younger voters , 18- to 29 , who may not suffer the president , but often do not vote . ”	-4.8355
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , stating her allegations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts suggested that a backlash might follow if Republicans drive the candidacy .	-4.9352
“ For GOP this has become a confused mess , ” said Michael Steele , former chairman of the Republican National Committee , at the beginning of last week , NBC News .	-4.8431
“ It is not just about the committee vote or the final vote , or whether Kavanaugh is put on the replacement bank , but about how the Republicans have handled this and how they have treated it , ” said Guy Cecil , director of US priorities , a group that helps the Democratic Party to elect the news station .	-6.7741
But Americans are divided about what Ford and Kavanaugh have said .	-5.1828
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 % of respondents believed Ford ’ s testimony definitively or probably , while 35 % said that they definitely or probably believed Kavanaugh .	-5.4404
Moreover , 38 % said that they thought Kavanaugh had probably or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 % said the same about Ford .	-3.4465
On the initiative of Flake , the FBI is currently investigating the allegations of Ford and at least another prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-3.0062
Ford said last week before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee under Eid that Kavanaugh had attacked them in the age of of 17 .	-3.8020
Ramirez accuses the most senior judge nominees of having revealed his Genital in front of her during her study in Yale in the 1980s .	-7.7303
The inventor of the World Wide Web is planning a new Internet to challenge Google and Facebook .	-2.9901
Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , is a start-up company that is expected to compete with Facebook , Amazon and Google .	-7.0972
The latest technology legend project , Unrupt , is a company that builds on Berners-Lee 's open-source Solid platform .	-3.9204
With Solid , users can determine where their data are stored and which persons may have access to what information .	-3.5214
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee said that the goal of Inrupt is to take over the world .	-7.6840
“ We need to do it now , ” he said about the start-up .	-1.7826
“ It is an historic moment . ”	-1.0366
The app uses Solid technology to help users create personal online data storage or a POD .	-3.9419
Data storage can include contact lists , tasks , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-3.8090
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all available on a browser and all at the same time .	-2.5779
The special thing about personal online data storage is that it is entirely up to the user to access what kind of information is possible .	-3.9958
The company calls it “ people empower by data . ”	-2.8578
According to the CEO of John Bruce , interrupt will provide resources , processes and appropriate know-how to make Solid accessible to a broad audience .	-3.7724
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform acquired by IBM , some of the people involved in the project and a community of volunteer programmers .	-4.0992
As of this week , technology developers can create their own decentralized apps worldwide using the tools available on the interrupt website .	-5.2576
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor he himself will talk to Facebook and Google about the comprehensive changes that will put all previous business models on their heads overnight .	-4.0979
“ We will not ask for permission . ”	-2.4989
In a paper on medium published on Saturday , Berners-Lee wrote that Intrits ' mission is to provide commercial energy and an ecosystem to protect the integrity and quality of the new web built on solid . '	-3.6437
In 1994 , Berners-Lee transformed the Internet when he founded the World Wide Web Consortium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .	-2.3678
Berners-Lee has strongly influenced the debate on net neutrality in recent months .	-2.6070
He also remains founder and director of the World Wide Web Consortium , the Web Foundation , and the Open Data Institute .	-3.7828
“ I ’ m incredibly optimistic about the next era of the Internet , ” notes Berners-Lee .	-2.7584

The only priest of the England Church who received a Victoria Cross during World War I was celebrated in his home city 100 years later .	-5.8557
Oberstlietant and Reverend Bernard Vann deserved the award on September 29 , 1918 when the attack in Bellenglise and Lehaucourt took place .	-5.7324

One of his grandsons , Michael Vann , said that it was “ incredibly symbolic ” that the stone was revealed exactly 100 years after his grandfather ’ s heroism .	-3.2165
According to the London Gazette , Oberstlietant Vann conducted his battalion in September 1918 via the Saint-Quentin channel “ with very dense fog and heavy fire by field protection and machine gun ” .	-5.7405
Later , he stormed to the thrust line , leading the line forward with the “ biggest gallery ” before moving on one hand to a field pistol and pressed three times the draw .	-8.6756
Lieutenant Colonel Vann was killed by a German sniper on October 4 , 1918 – just under a month before the end of the war .	-3.7663
Michael Vann , 72 , said the actions of his grandfather were ' something I know I could never live up to , something that begs humility ' .	-3.9747
He and his brother Dr. James Vann also laid down a scratch after the parade led by the Brentwood Imperial Youth Band .	-3.4805

MMA fans remained awake all night to see Bellator 206 , instead they got Peppa Pig .	-1.9895
Imagine you stayed awake all night to see the complete Bellator 206 event just to avoid seeing the main event .	-5.4414
There were 13 battles on the San Jose plan , including six main battles and was shown live at night in the UK on Channel 5 .	-4.8266
At 6 o 'clock in the morning , just as Gegard Mousasi and Rory MacDonald were preparing to meet , British viewers were able to see how the reporting on Peppa Pig was edited .	-6.1643
Some were unchecked after they remained awake until the early morning hours , extra for the fight .	-6.1629
A fan on Twitter described the change to the cartoon as " some sick joke " .	-4.6069
" It is a state rule that at 6 o 'clock in the morning these contents were not suitable so that they had to switch to children 's programmes , " said Dave Schwartz , Bellator Senior Vice President of Marketing and Communication , when he was asked about the transfer .	-5.3308
" Peppa the pig , " yes . "	-2.7786
Bellators ’ Managing Director Scott Coker said that they will be working on their planning in the future to involve British viewers .	-5.8401
" If I think about the repetition , we will somehow get it up , " said Cocker .	-3.6613
" But it is 6 am on a Sunday there , and we will not be able to fix it until Sunday of our time , Monday of its time .	-4.0835
But we are working on it .	-1.6580
Believe me when it was turned on , a lot was written and the content was not friendly .	-3.0771
We tried to fix it , we thought it would be a technical error .	-1.9127
But it was not , it was a government problem .	-2.1191
I can promise you that it will not happen next time .	-2.0976
We will reduce it to five rather than six battles - as we usually do - and we have tried to outdo the fans and have just gone through .	-4.8124
It is an unfavourable situation . '	-1.5983
Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt inferior due to his sexuality .	-2.4789
The Olympic diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling that his sexuality was inferior to all - but that gave him the motivation to become a success .	-5.1902
The 24-year-old said that he had only become aware at the secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-3.1831
In the first edition of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 presented by Lauren Laverne , he said that he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give others “ hope . ”	-3.0857
He also said that victory in the Olympic Games after the birth of his first child would have become less important to him .	-2.1710
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has taken off for several months due to illness .	-5.5924
Daley appeared in Lavernes ’ first program , saying that he felt “ less worth than the others , ” because “ society did not accept standing up to men and women . ”	-6.8292
He said : “ To this day , these feelings of Wenger value and otherness have given me strength and strength , I needed you to be successful . ”	-4.3870
He wanted to prove that he is “ something , ” he meant to disappoint no one when he leads from his sexual orientation .	-4.3629
The double-screen bronze medal winner has become a high-caliber LGBT activist and took advantage of his appearance at this year 's Commonwealth Games in Australia to call on more countries to decriminalise homosexuality .	-4.5034
He said he spoke out because he was lucky to live openly and without consequences , and because he wanted to give others ' hope ' .	-3.7705
The three-time world champion said that he fell in love with a man , the US film maker Dustin Lance Black , whom he met in 2013 , about which he was very surprised .	-4.5593
Daley married the Oscar winner who is 20 years old than he was last year , but the age difference was never a problem .	-3.8429
“ If you experience so much in such young years ” – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time at 14 years , three years later his father died of cancer – whether he was hard to find someone at the same age who experienced similar highs and lows .	-5.8109
The couple was in June parents of a son , Robert Ray Black-Daley , and Daley said that his " whole perspective " has changed .	-3.1971
“ Last year , everything revolved around me winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-4.6566
" But you know what , there is more important than Olympic gold .	-2.5495
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-1.0054
His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 after a cancer diagnosis with only 40 years .	-2.9889
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-2.9633
“ I couldn ’ t tell him : <unk> You will no longer experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , ” he said .	-3.4657
“ I kept his hand when his breathing exposed .	-4.0617

Weak Mickelson was sitting on the Ryder Cup Saturday at the Bank	-5.5947
American Phil Mickelson will set a record on Sunday when he plays his 47th Ryder Cup game , but he has to dramatically improve his shape to make it no sad milestone .	-4.1909
Mickelson , who played for the 12th time at the event that takes place every two years , was put on the bank by Captain Jim Furyk for the Fourballs and Foursomes on Saturday .	-3.7411
Instead of being at the center of the event , as is so often the case for the US , the five-time Major victory divided his day between fires and exercise rounds on the golf course , hoping to overcome his depth .	-5.9523
Even at the height of his career , the 48-year-old is never the most straight-line driver and is not suitable for the narrow Le Golf National Square , where the long Rough regularly punishes failures .	-5.7305
And as if the place alone were not challenging enough , Mickelson met in the ninth match on Sunday at the famous British-Open Champion Francesco Molinari , who won all four matches this week together with Neuling Tommy Fleetwood .	-8.8746
If Americans have four points behind and a hot start at the start of the 12 games , Mickelsons Match could be absolutely decisive .	-4.9956
Furyk expressed his trust in his man ; what was left to him .	-3.9217
" He fully understood the role he had today , gave me a clap on my back and put his arm around me and said he would be ready tomorrow , " said Furyk .	-3.4955
“ He has a lot of confidence .	-2.0550
He is a member of the Hall of Fame and has done so much for these teams in the past , and this week .	-1.9629
I probably wouldn 't have thought he was playing two games .	-2.3336
I wanted to see more , but that is the way in which we thought we had to get it .	-6.9426
He wants to be out there , just like everyone else .	-1.3096
So far , Nick Faldo holds the record for most played matches at the Ryder Cup .	-4.5494
This could mark the end of a Ryder Cup career , which has never matched the heights of its individual record .	-4.2243
Mickelson has won 18 times , lost 20 times and played seven times undiscovered .	-4.3098
" He is funny , he is sarcastic , funny , he loves to entertain people , and he is a great guy that he can have in the team room , " he explained .	-3.7697
I think the younger players also had fun this week to compete with him , that was nice to see . ”	-4.7180
It offers much more than just the game . ”	-1.4173
The European captain Thomas Bjorn knows that a great lead can disappear soon .	-3.3057
Thomas Bjorn , the European captain , knows from experience that a great lead in the single games of the last day can quickly become an uncomfortable kick at the Ryder Cup .	-5.1422
In 1997 , the Dane lost in Valderrama , where a team trained by Seve Ballesteros had a lead of five points towards the Americans , but only just reached the finishing line and won a tremendous lead from 14 <unk> to 13 <unk> .	-6.4919
" We remember that we were in leadership in Valderrama ; we had a great lead in Brookline where we lost .	-6.5458
The story will show me and everyone in this team that it is not over yet .	-2.1613
You will have finished tomorrow completely .	-3.0105
Get out and do the right things .	-1.4410
It is not over until the points are displayed on the table .	-3.9299
Our goal is to win this Cup , and this is what we focus on .	-4.4114
I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.8168
Enthusiasm as his players played on a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be premature .	-3.5460
Tomorrow is another day .	-1.5515
Tomorrow the personal performances are coming , and that is another thing .	-3.5912
It 's cool out there to be with a partner if things are going well , but if you are out there alone , then your abilities as golf players will be tested over all .	-6.1358
This is the message you must convey to players : Get the best out of it tomorrow .	-3.9078
Now you go over to your partner and he has to work as you can . ”	-5.9689
In contrast to Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive for his players to do this individually better than they do as partners , except Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who made three out of four points .	-5.9979
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn on the end of the day , when he was part of the team of winners in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team accomplished the “ miracle of Mediaclose ” .	-6.4874
" I remember every dirty word , " he said how Ben Crenshaw , the 1999 captain , had assembled his players on the way to the last day .	-4.5559
We have 12 important games tomorrow , but you want to get started as soon as possible , as you can see in Brooklyn , in Mediaclose .	-5.4993
Once an individual dynamics have developed , the pressure on the middle matches is exerted .	-5.5451
We have built up our list accordingly and brought the guys out as we felt , you know we are trying to create something special tomorrow . ”	-7.4183
Thomas , along with Paul Casey , Justin Rose , Jon Rahm , Tommy Fleetwood and Ian Poulter , should lead the other European on top places in the league , in the top game the counterstrike against Rory McIlroy .	-5.3941
I put this group of guys in this order because I think it covers the whole way , " said Bjorn about his individual selection .	-3.3986
Renewed postponement of the timetable for Germany ’ s New Warfare	-3.5236
The German Navy ’ s newest ferrets should have been put in service in 2014 to replace Cold War warships that have been in use for years , but according to reports from local media , it will take at least until next year .	-7.7830
The commissioning of the “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” , the flagship ship of the brand new Baden-Wuerttemberg vessels , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the paper “ Die Zeit ” referring to a military speaker .	-6.5316
The Navy should have started its vessels in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery weighed the ambitious project .	-4.5595
The four naval ships in the Baden-Wuerttemberg class ordered by the Navy in 2007 will replace the older ships of the Brem.	-4.9602
It is estimated that it has a powerful cannon , a range of anti-air and naval missiles and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.8726
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest ferrets should be used for up to two years without running the home port .	-5.0077
However , the constant delays , when they are finally put in service , as the weekly newspaper notes , will mean that Germany will be able to project power overseas .	-6.7322
Last year , the unhappy F125-Fregatte made headlines when the German navy officially refused to take the ship into operation and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-5.7237
This was the first time that the Navy returned a ship to a ship owner after delivery .	-2.8924
Little was known about the reasons for the return of ships ; German media mentioned a series of critical " software and hardware issues " that would make the warship useless in combat missions .	-4.9296
In the early days of the German Civil War , the German army was forced to leave the German army .	-12.1987
It also turned out that the ship had a significant overweight , limiting performance and making future upgrades difficult for the navy .	-4.7439
It is assumed that the 7.000-ton “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by the Germans in World War II .	-3.0773
In addition to faulty hardware , the project price tag - including crew training - is also covered .	-5.7103
Instead of the EUR 2.2 billion initially estimated , costs have now apparently reached the staggering figure of EUR 3.1 billion ( about $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.6716
The problems with the latest ferrets are particularly important in light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s seapower is dwindling .	-5.1510
At the beginning of this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the German Parliament ’ s Defence Committee , admitted that the war fleet is actually “ running out of operational vessels . ”	-5.6642
The official said that , over time , the problem has grown asleep , as old ships have been put out of service without any replacement .	-6.7431
He complained that none of the bathing establishments were put in service by the Navy .	-3.4314
The National Trust covers the secret lives of bats .	-2.8429
New research on a property in the Highlands of Scotland is trying to find out how bats use the landscape to search for food .	-4.3866
It is hoped that this will bring new insights into the behaviour of unique flying mammals , which can provide guidance for future measures to protect animals .	-5.6434
The study by scientists of the National Trust for Scotland will follow common and Soprano runs as well as brown long-ohered and down ton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Wester Ross .	-6.1479
Special recording equipment is placed at main points of the accommodation to track Fledermaust activities throughout the season .	-5.2949
NHS staff and volunteers will also perform mobile surveys with handdetectors .	-2.9346
An expert tone analysis of all the recordings determines the frequency of the Fledermauscalls and classifies the calls to the species .	-6.4145
The Habitats Card to be created and the report to be drawn up should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-5.3102
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) , hopes to find out what areas of space are most important for the bats and how they are used by the species .	-4.1302
This information will help to identify the benefits of habitat management , how best to preserve meadow formation and forests for bats and other species related to it .	-5.9012
There has been a sharp decline in the bats in Scotland and the United Kingdom over the past hundred years .	-4.8471
They are threatened by construction works affecting their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-3.0655
Also , wind turbines and lighting can pose a risk , as well as tile strip and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-7.0501
Bats are not blind in fact .	-2.8088
The ears are more useful when starting loot than the eyes , due to their nocturnal hunting activities .	-6.4065
They use a sophisticated Echo Ortage technique to locate bugs and obstacles in their way .	-4.4097
The NTS , which is responsible for maintaining more than 270 historical buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land around the country , takes the bats very seriously .	-2.8384
There are ten trained experts who regularly carry out surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes perform rescuations .	-3.9444
The organization has even established Scotland 's first and only dedicated Fledermaus Reserve in the Threaded estate in Dumfries and Galloway , home to eight of the ten Scottish bats .	-4.9603
According to Manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.5733
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.6513
“ We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-2.1889
But there is still a lot of unknown about bats and the work that we do here and in other areas helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-4.3438
He stresses that it is important to check whether bats are there before maintenance work in buildings , according to which it is possible that , in the accidental destruction of a single sleeping place for mothers , up to 400 females and young people – a whole local population may be wiped out .	-8.7429
Fledermice are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb and destroy their sleeping places .	-4.0020
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee at the Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-1.7381
She said : “ We have much more to learn about our bats , and for many of our species , we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-3.0505

Cristiano Ronaldo denounced rape claims against him as " fake news " and claims that people " want to promote themselves " by using his name .	-3.1143
His lawyers will sue the German news magazine “ Der Spiegel ” , which published the allegations .	-2.0552
He was accused of having raped an American woman named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-4.0402
He was asked to pay her $ 375,000 to keep her silent about the incident , The mirror on Friday .	-5.0340
Hours after the claims have been reported , Ronaldo , 33 reported in an instant live video to his 142 million followers as “ fake news . ”	-3.4846

" You want to apply for yourself by using my name .	-1.8218
“ That is normal .	-1.3989
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-2.2829
I am a happy person , and everything is good , ” the player smiled .	-3.0631
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are preparing a lawsuit against the magazine “ Der Spiegel ” for claims ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ an inadmissible disclosure of privacy suspicions . ”	-6.1988
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for “ intangible damage equal to the gravity of the violation , which is probably one of the most serious violations of the rights of personality in recent years . ”	-7.0162
The alleged incident will have occurred in a Suite at Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas in June 2009 .	-3.2053
According to records filed at Clark County District Court in Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga returned to the player ’ s room in a nightclub , where he raped them .	-5.2075
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen to his knees after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” abandoned by the “ one percent . ”	-4.7922
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the couple had sex , but it was consensual .	-1.9871
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and made photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she was " afraid of retaliation " and worried about " being publicly humiliated " .	-5.2235
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to annul the agreement because it remains traumatized by the alleged incident .	-3.5656
Ronaldo was on the eve of his move to Real Madrid by Manchester United at the time of alleged attack , and this summer he switched to the Italian giant Juve with a 100 million Euro deal .	-6.4066
Brexit : Britain would forever regret losing car manufacturers	-1.4092
“ The UK would regret it if it lost its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Minister Greg Clark .	-3.8001
He added that it is " worrying " that Toyota UK told the BBC that they would temporarily cease production at their factory in Burnabton , near Derby , if major Britain left the EU without a deal .	-4.0390
“ We need an agreement , ” Clark said .	-1.8265
The Japanese car manufacturer said that the impact of delays at borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-3.1554
The Burnaston plant , which produces Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced almost 150,000 cars last year , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-3.1916
“ When Britain leaves the EU at the end of March without an agreement , I believe that our work will halt production , ” said Marvin Cook , CEO of Toyota in Burnabon .	-4.9861
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on the arrangements for cross-border trade , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-3.4180
BMW , for example , has already announced that it will close its work in Oxford after Brexit for a month .	-2.3843
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the event of a ' no deal of Brexit ' .	-3.3796
The Toyota production facilities are based on manufacturing that is geared to the needs , that is , the parts are delivered every 37 minutes by suppliers from the United Kingdom and the EU for special products .	-6.1381
If the UK leaves the EU on 29 March without an agreement , there may be delays at the border , which can lead to shortages and shortages , according to industry information .	-4.8705
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than a day of its plant in Derbyshire , the company said , and so production would be stopped .	-4.0679
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers plan for future relations with the EU was “ accurately calibrated to avoid these border controls . ”	-3.2935
We need to have a deal , we want the best deal that not only enables us to achieve the current success , we also want to seize this opportunity , ” he said the BBC Radio Day program today .	-6.1904
“ The reference not only from Toyota but also from other manufacturers is that it is imperative that we be able to continue with what has become a very successful series of supply chains . ”	-6.3378
Toyota did not specify how long the production stop could last , but warned that the cost increase could suffer long-term competitiveness of the plant and eventually lose jobs .	-5.7539
Peter Tsouvallaris , trade union representatives , and for 24 years in Burnaston , said that trade union members are increasingly worried : “ My experience is that once they are mined , jobs are lost forever . ”	-6.3645

The meeting of Trump with Rosenstein could shift again , says the White House	-2.7679
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein could be " postponed another week " , as the fight for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , read the White House on Sunday .	-5.3821
Rosenstein oversees the work of Robert Mueller ’ s special adviser investigating Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the president ’ s possible impediment to justice .	-4.0262
Whether Trump will or will not fire the Deputy Attorney General , and thus jeopardizing the independence of Müller , Washington has produced a lot of gossip for months .	-5.1674
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed wearing a cable to record talks with Trump and to make it possible to remove the president from the last 25 constitutional amendment .	-4.4896
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-1.6450
But last Monday he came to the White House , while reports hated that he was about to resign .	-3.5486
Instead , a meeting with Trump at the United Nations in New York was announced for Thursday .	-2.6163
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the sitting was delayed to avoid a collision with the hearing of the Senate ’ s Justice Committee , in which Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misbehavior .	-4.8710
On Friday , Trump filed a one-week FBI investigation against Kavanaugh , further delaying a full senatorial sentiment .	-3.5308
Donald Trump ’ s spokesperson , Sarah Sanders , was on show at Fox News on Sunday .	-3.8046
After the Rosensteiner meeting asked , she said : " A date for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I am going back another week , given all the other things that go ahead with the Supreme Court .	-5.5310
But we will see and I always keep the press informed . '	-2.4659
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.1271
Chris Wallace asked why .	-1.2664
Sanders said that the lack of briefings is not due to an aversion to television reporters who behave like self-serving actors , but she also said : ' I will not oppose them in the gallery ' .	-6.3566
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-2.0269
" The President carries out more questions and answers than any President before him , " she said and added , without giving evidence : " We have looked at these figures . "	-4.4881
Postings will still take place , Sanders said , but the press should have the opportunity to put the questions directly to the President of the United States , so it is infinitely better than talking to her .	-4.6905
We are trying to do a lot of that , and you have seen how we have done this in recent weeks , and a press debate will replace if you can talk to the President of the United States himself . ”	-5.0984
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or participates in public meetings or press conferences with attended dignitaries .	-2.2801
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.6142
In New York , the President perhaps showed why by making a free-standing and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters this week .	-3.8563

Health Minister has written EU staff at Scotland NHS to the country ’ s gratitude and the desire to remain after Brexit .	-3.9330
Scottish MPs Jane Freeman wrote her letter less than 6 months before Britain left the EU .	-2.9626

But the British Government has also intensified its preparations for a possible no-deal scenario .	-1.9733
I know that this must be a very worrying time for you all .	-2.2033
That is why I wanted to repeat now how much I would value the contribution of every employee , regardless of their nationality .	-3.8445
Colleagues across the EU and beyond provide valuable experience and skills that strengthen and improve health care and benefit the patients and communities that we provide .	-4.6117
Scotland is certainly your home and we want you to stay . ”	-2.3581

“ I wanted to compete as a player for my country . ”	-1.8242
I got a B-cap and that was ' s ' , said Ross to BBC Scotland Sportsound .	-2.7076

The former manager of Alloa Athletic said he had no fear of joining these established managers in such a large club .	-4.9603
" The success for me is currently defined by the question " Can I bring this association back to the Premier League ? "	-2.5928
With its structure and facilities , this club undoubtedly belongs to the Premier League , ” he said .	-2.4700
“ Creating it there is no easy task , but I would probably only see me as successful if I can bring the club back to it again . ”	-4.8152
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-trainer at Dumarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-3.5920
He then helped Alloa to recover from the release to the third class , and helped St. Mirren from the margins of the release in the following season to become a master title .	-4.6555
Ross also says that he never felt as comfortable as he was at the moment when he was playing at Clyde , Hartlepool , Falkirk , St Mirren and Hamilton Academic .	-5.2524

The heatwave has increased revenue for the hit British pubs , but increased pressure on the restaurant chains .	-4.8644

Peter Martin , of the CGA company consultancy , which put the figures together , said : " Keep sunshine and England for longer than expected to take part in the World Cup , July followed a pattern similar to that of the previous month of June , when the pub visits increased by 2.8 % , but the restaurants were even more affected .	-8.2089
The fall in the catering business by 1.8 percent in June has only increased in July .	-3.6568
Drinking drinks dominated pubs and bars did most occur , with the Like-for-Like numbers rising more than the restaurants fell .	-6.2463

The weather and the effects of social or major sporting events remain the greatest factors when it comes to selling in the outside house market .	-4.4913
It is not surprising that restaurant groups are still under pressure , although a drop in sales of 4.8 percent over the previous year will be particularly painful as well as ongoing cost pressure .	-5.7676
The long hot summer could never have been worse for food operators , and the time will show whether the more moderate temperatures we experienced in August will provide the much-needed break .	-4.7008

Milk powders advertising , in which mothers are compared with cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-5.4814
A dairy pump company has caused controversial online discussions , owing to an ad that compares nursing mothers with milk-cows .	-5.2624
On the occasion of the market launch of the supposedly " world 's first noisy and portable milk pump " , the consumer company Elvie published an ironic , inspired advertising inspired by music videos to show the freedoms mothers are offered with this new pump .	-6.0005
Four real mothers dance in a hippie surrounded by cows to a number containing the following lyrics : " Yes , I melke me , but you do not see a cock " and " If you have not noticed that it is not your brother , it is my breasts " .	-7.3699
The slogan goes on : " Pump off , pump off , I feed the babies , pump off , pump off , pump off , I melt my Ladies . "	-3.6293
However , the ad published on the company 's Facebook page has caused controversy online .	-2.5061
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from spectators , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy economy .	-3.8688
" It is a very bad decision to advertise this product with cows " .	-2.5526
Like we must also become pregnant and give birth to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days of birth , " wrote a person .	-4.6858
The Elvie Milk Pump never stops fitting into a Still H ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-3.7954
Another comment was " understandably traumatic to mother and baby .	-2.8508
But yes , why should we not use them to advertise a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-3.2046
Someone else added : ' This is an external action ' .	-3.6189
Others defended the advertising , among other things a woman who admitted that she found the song “ urstrange ” .	-5.2697
I think that is a great idea .	-1.3175
I would have got one more if I had been satisfied .	-4.8743
Through the pumps I felt like a cow .	-2.2362
The ad is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.2807
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-2.0520
Another comment was : " This is a funny advertisement for mothers who pumps ( often on their jobs or toilets ) and feel like " cows " .	-3.8976
This is not an advertisement that praises or evaluates the dairy industry ' .	-3.2512
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they have all shot in their hands with the subtle pumps .	-4.6447
The campaign ’ s concept is based on the realization that many women who pump milk say they feel like cows .	-3.0194
The Elvie Pump , however , is completely silent , has no wires or hoses and constantly fits into a breastcoat , giving women the freedom to move , to keep their babies and even to go to pumps .	-6.1520
Ana Balarin , partner and ECD commented to Mother : " The Elvie-Puzzle is such a revolutionary product that deserves a bold and provocative market launch .	-3.3995
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on the chest pumps and all its challenges , while simultaneously demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring with it .	-5.4444
This is not the first time that the Elvie-Puzzle comes into the headlines .	-2.7500

Hundreds of migrant children quietly moved into a camp on the Texas border .	-3.2891
The number of imprisoned children with immigrant backgrounds rose , though monthly crossings have remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it harder to find sponsors for children .	-4.1814
Traditionally , most sponsors have been undocumented immigrants , and fear that they risk being expelled when they care for a child .	-4.5246
The risk increased in June , when federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their budgets would have to fingerprint and that the data would be passed on to immigration authorities .	-3.8061
Last week , Matthew Allik , a senior official in the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , reported to Congress that the Agency had arrested dozens of people who had applied to support unaccompanied minors .	-4.6478
The agency later confirmed that 70 % of those arrested had no previous criminal records .	-2.8086
" Almost 80 % of people who are either sponsors or budget members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal aliens .	-3.2043
" We are tracking these people further , " said Albence .	-4.8612
In an effort to process children ’ s applications more quickly , officials introduced new rules that some of them require to appear in court within a month of detention , rather than 60 days of what was the previous standard , that is , accommodation staff .	-6.8540
Many will appear not personally , but through a video telephone conference to argue for legal status with an immigrant judge .	-4.7521
Those who do not qualify for discharge will be speedily reversed .	-3.8333
The longer children remain imprisoned , the more likely it is that they will be frightened or deported , which may lead to violent outbreaks or attempts to escape .	-5.3205
Proponents said that these concerns are reinforced in a larger institution like Tornillo , where signs that a child has to fight are rather overlooked due to their size .	-4.7349
They added that moving children to the tent city , without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or to pass away from friends , could worsen a trauma that many are already struggling to cope .	-5.8906
Syria calls on US , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-1.8418
Foreign Minister Walid al-Mouales also called on Syrian refugees to return home before the UN General Assembly , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-3.7758
Mouelle , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegally on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism , and ‘ they will deal with it ’ .	-5.3712
“ You must immediately withdraw unconditionally , ” he told the Assembly . , , and .	-3.9853
Mouelle claimed that the “ war on terror almost over ” in Syria ; over 360,000 people have died in the country since 2011 , and millions more have been displaced from their homes .	-5.4087
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this holy battle until we have freed all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence force . ”	-2.7528
The US has around 2,000 soldiers in Syria ; mainly train and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs who are in opposition to President Bashar al-Assad .	-3.6365
France has used more than 1,000 land soldiers in the war-torn country .	-2.2263
On the question of refugees , Mouales said that the conditions for return were in order , and he accused “ some Western countries of irrational fears , ” which led refugees to stay away .	-5.0424
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate a return , ” he said .	-3.2308
“ They actually politicize a purely humanitarian issue . ”	-2.9199
The US and the European Union pointed out that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria if a political agreement between Assad and the opposition ended the war .	-3.9185
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on the establishment of a buffer zone in the last major rebel stronghold , Idlib , was able to advance political talks .	-4.0334
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russia on the province in which three million people lived .	-3.6507
But Mousels stressed that the agreement “ clear deadlines ” , which he hopes , will be used against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra , affiliated with Al Qaeda , who are “ wiped out . ”	-8.6686
UN envoy Staffan de Mistura hopes to convene the first meetings of a new committee from members of government and opposition to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.4862

External money is flowing into the narrowest mid-term elections to the House of Commons	-3.9268
It is not surprising that Pennsylvania saw a flood of cash in the 17th century , thanks to a reorientation of a congress district that two officials reached in a race for the same seat .	-5.9139
For this new district in the suburb of Pittsburg , the Democrat Conor Lamb joins – who won a seat in another district in a special election last spring .	-4.7734
Lamb is attacking another incumbent , the Republican Keith Rothfus , who currently represents the old 12th district of Pennsylvania , which is clearly overlapping with the new 17 .	-4.6359

Representatives of the US Ministry of Foreign Affairs decided to withdraw American ambassadors from El Salvador , the Dominican Republic , and Panama in a statement at the beginning of this month , given the “ recent decisions not to recognise Taiwan . ”	-4.5654
But sanctions were considered only against El Salvador , which received an estimated $ 140 million in US aid in 2017 , including on-the-spot checks , development , and economic support .	-4.9488

The Rangers are the host for Rapid Vienna on Thursday , knowing that the victory over the Austrians , following the impressive equatorial state in Spain at the beginning of this month , brings them into a strong position to qualify for the Europe League from Group G .	-5.1187

Paul Rowlett , analyst at the US Ministry of Justice has stated several hours as an expert in the field of information assessment .	-4.2401
He outlined for the jury how he put together the movements of the 29-year-old quintan Tellis and the 19-year-old victim Jessica Chambers during the night of their death based on mobile recordings .	-6.0279
Rowlett said he received location data from several cell phones who showed that Tellis was with Chambers in the evening of her death , which contradicted his earlier claims , reported The Clarion Ledger .	-4.6025
The data analysis on Chambers mobile phone had shown that he was in company of his friend Michael Sanford , and Sanford was interrogated by the police .	-4.9088
Sanford said on Saturday and explained that he was not in town this day .	-4.3891
On the question of prosecutors whether Tellis spent the night in Sanford ’ s truck , he replied that he lied because his truck was in Nashville at that time .	-4.5696
Another inconsistency was that Tellis said that he knew Chambers for about two weeks when she died .	-2.7150
According to mobile recordings , they had only been known for a week .	-4.0842
Rowlett said that after Chambers died Tellis deleted text messages , call and contact information from his phone .	-3.0502

Instead of sending him to her husband , she sent him twice to Mrs Maurice .	-2.0789
After she had noticed her father , a " uncomfortable " Plasco-Flamman released Mrs. Maurice and explained that her outgoing boyfriend , who was African-American , had done a bad job and that she wanted to hire a Filipino instead , the New York Post .	-7.0681
Mrs Maurice was paid for her work on a day and then sent home for a Uber .	-2.8225
Now Maurice sues the pair for compensation for dismissal and claims compensation of $ 350 per day for the six-month full-time job for which she had originally been hired , albeit without a contract .	-5.2279
" I will show them , look at them , neither do they do not , " she said the post on Friday and added : " I know that this discrimination is . "	-6.4985
The couple gave contrast to the claims , and said that the decision to end Maurice ’ s work relationship was sensible and that they acted for fear , because they could not trust her after she was offended .	-5.4048

Paddington publishers feared that readers could not identify with a talking bear , revealing a new letter .	-3.4695
Bond ’ s daughter , Karen Jankel , who was born shortly after the book ’ s adoption , said about the letter : It ’ s hard to move someone to read it for the first time before publishing .	-5.1456
“ It ’ s very funny – now that we know about Paddington ’ s great success . ”	-2.6397
She said that her father , who had previously worked as a BBC cameraman , and then was inspired to write a children 's book of a small toy bear , would have remained optimistic if his work had been rejected ; she added that the 60th anniversary of the book publication after his death last year was “ bitter . ”	-4.8852
In Paddington , which she calls a “ very important family member , ” she still says that her father was still proud of his eventual success .	-4.7374
" He was a pretty quiet man , and he was not a pitched person , " she said .	-3.4160
" But , because Paddington was so genuine for him , it was almost like having a child who achieved something : you are proud of the child , although it is not your doing .	-4.9187
I think he has seen Paddinton ’ s success a .	-5.7448

The medicine that had given her anger to push her heart further , slowly faded and left her body .	-4.3245
She had died some time before and that brought everything to a halt .	-2.6020
I simply had to sit there and wait , knowing what happens .	-1.9628
I could not shout or cry because I was surrounded by families and other people .	-2.1347
I really had to pull myself together .	-1.8321
After all , Mrs Ednan-Laperouse was mourning the loss of her daughter , aboard the aircraft with the other passengers , who knew nothing of the quality she was experiencing .	-6.2442

Ms. Davis ’ s son , Tyler , was 13 years old when he suffered depression , and at the age of 18 he died .	-4.7438
“ I want no parent to feel as I do every day , ” she said .	-1.9696
Ms. Davis , 45 years old and from Lyney , described her son as a promising cook with infectious smile .	-4.7315
" He was known for his smile .	-1.1061
As everyone said , his smile illuminated every room . ”	-3.9184
But he had abandoned his job before his death because he was “ mentally very bad . ”	-4.1062
In 2014 , Tyler , who was then 11 years old , found his brother after he had taken his life .	-3.3243
Mrs Davis said : ‘ I am always concerned that this could have a domino effect . ’	-2.8526

FBI investigations have begun , and Brett Kavanaugh ’ s future is at stake .	-1.8918
“ I thought that if we could actually get something like what he asked for - an inquiry that is limited in time and scope - we could perhaps reach a little agreement , ” Mr Flake said on Saturday , and added that he was afraid that the committee will “ fall apart ” in the midst of a deeply entrenched party political blockade .	-7.5616
Why did Mr. Kavanaugh and his Republican followers not want the FBI to be determined ?	-1.8070
Their reluctance is simply due to the timing .	-1.8901
Until the midterm elections are only five weeks , on 6 November , if the Republicans , as expected , cut badly , they will be greatly weakened in the attempt to move the man who has chosen to the country ’ s highest court .	-7.0088

North Korea ’ s Republic Winners Down	-3.4222
North Korea ’ s overrunners have fallen since Kim Jong-un came to power seven years ago , a South Korean MEP said .	-4.4209
On the basis of data from the southern unification ministry , Park Byeong-seg admitted last year 1.7 of trustees – compared to 2.706 in 2011 .	-7.0091
Park said that stricter border controls between North Korea and China and an increase in prices for human traffickers play an essential role in this .	-4.1890
Pyongyang did not speak publicly .	-1.8080
After all , the majority of those fleeing North Korea were granted South Korean citizenship .	-4.1625
Seoul says more than 30,000 North Koreans illegally crossed the border since the Korean War ended in 1953 .	-1.6017
Most are fleeing from China , which has the longest border with North Korea , which is easier to cross than the tightly guarded militarized zone between North and South Korea .	-3.7472
China views the supermigrants as illegal migrants , not as refugees , and often forcibly repatriates them .	-3.8534
Relations between the North and the South , which are formally still in war , have improved considerably in recent months .	-2.7288
Earlier this month , the leaders of both countries in Pyongyang met for talks about the stalled denuclearization negotiations .	-2.9999
This happened after the historic meeting in June between US President Donald Trump and Kim Jong-un in Singapore , when they largely agreed to the Korean nuclear-free peninsula .	-2.6604
But on Saturday , North Korea ’ s foreign minister , Ri Yong-ho , blamed the US for the lack of progress since then .	-2.5536

Pelosi made the comments on a Saturday interview at the Texas Tribune Festival in Austin , Texas .	-1.5454
“ I could not think that if a woman had ever done so , they would have called it “ hysterical , ” Pelosi said about her response to Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate Justice Committee on Thursday .	-5.5423
Kavanaugh was a member of the Federation of Planets and the Federation of Planets .	-9.2770
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he wrote almost and fought with the tears when he talked about his family and his high school years .	-3.5413
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in the committee , calling the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated campaign of cry ” organised by liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the presidential election in 2016 .	-4.6676
Pelosi said that she believed that Kavanaugh 's statement that he could not serve in the Supreme Court because he showed that he was prejudiced against democrats .	-4.9984
“ I believe that he himself disqualified , ” she said , with such statements and the way he is influenced by Clinton and the Democrats .	-4.7967
When asked whether , in the event of its confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , it would seek an administrative de-levying procedure against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-5.9159
“ I want to say the following : if he does not tell Congress or the FBI the truth , he is not only unfit for the Supreme Court service , but also for the service to the court in which he is currently employed , ” said Pelosi .	-5.8985
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. District Court .	-3.5379
Pelosi added that she , as a democrat , was worried about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade , as he stands for conservative justice .	-3.8418
In his confirmation hearing , Kavanaugh asked questions about whether he would overthrow certain Supreme Court decisions .	-4.5817
“ It is not time for a hysterical , biased person to go to court and expect us to say , “ Is this not wonderful , ” said Pelosi .	-4.6244
And women must keep it .	-2.2414
It is a veritable heatspeech , months and years of anger , and it cannot smother it without crying .	-4.2960
'We cry when we get angry ' , Mrs Steinem said to me 45 years later .	-2.2950
" I do not think that this is unusual , or ? "	-2.1685
She continued : “ I once helped a woman in the executive that told me that she was also crying when she was angry , but she developed a technique in which she was angry and began to cry to the person with whom she spoke , said : “ They like that I am sad because I wines .	-6.7890
I am angered . '	-1.7353
And then it simply went on .	-2.2233
And I thought it was brilliant . ”	-1.1993
They are allowed as a valve of anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-4.2610
One of my strongest memories of an early job in a male-dominated office in which I once lamented with indescribable anger was that I was being wrapped at the neck of an older woman , an eke manager before which I was always a bit scared - who dragged me into a stair house .	-7.6985
" Let them never see you crying , " she told me .	-1.8460
" You don 't know that you are angry .	-1.6654
They think you are sad and will rejoice because they caught you . '	-3.2280
Patricia Schroeder , then a Democratic Congressman from Colorado , supported Gary Hart in his presidential election campaign .	-1.7333
In 1987 , when it became known that Mr. Hart had an extra-marital affair on board a boat called “ Monkey Business ” , he was out of the race .	-3.9841
“ It was not a well-thought-out decision , ” she told me with a laughter 30 years later .	-2.5094
" There were already seven more candidates in the race , and the last thing they needed was another .	-2.0360
Someone called it ' snowtwitches and the seven Dwarves ' .	-4.3981
Because the campaign was already underway long ago , it was lagging behind in terms of funding , and so it vowed that it would not participate in the race unless it collected $ 2 million .	-6.1939
It was a lost battle .	-1.3895
She noted that some of her followers , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give her only $ 250 .	-2.7447
“ Do they think that I get the better ? ” she wondered .	-4.8367
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude to the people who had supported them , frustration with the system that made it so difficult to collect money and address voters instead of delegates , and anger about sexism - that she was stifled .	-5.1776
“ One might think that I had a nervous breakdown , ” Schroeder remembers how the press reacted to it .	-5.7996
" It would have been thought that Kleenex is my company sponsor .	-1.7885
I remember thinking about what they would write on my tombstone .	-1.8425

US President Donald Trump issued the first warning early this year by taxing important Chinese exports like solar panels , steel , and aluminum .	-2.7530
The introduction of new tariffs to US imported Chinese products worth $ 200 billion ( <unk> 150 billion ) this week has led to a dramatic escalation of the situation .	-2.7044
Beijing has reverted every time in the form of material achievements , and most recently tariffs of between five and ten percent rose to US goods worth $ 60 billion .	-5.6875
China answers the US every blow , and it is unlikely that the world ’ s second-largest economy will fall in the near future .	-3.7820
Bringing Washington around would mean concealing the claims , but bending publicly to the United States would be far too bumpy for Xi Jinping , China ’ s president .	-6.0394
But if Beijing uses its opportunities properly , the trade war with the US can have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing the mutual dependencies of the two economies , experts say .	-4.5897
“ The fact that a rapid political decision in Washington or Beijing can create the conditions for economic turbulence in one of the two countries is much more dangerous than observers assumed earlier , ” said Abigail Grace , a scientific employee at the Center for New American Security , a think tank with the focus of Asia .	-4.0533
