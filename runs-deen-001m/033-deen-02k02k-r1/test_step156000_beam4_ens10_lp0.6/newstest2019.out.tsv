The US should double Artificial Intelligence Spending	-10.2951
While China becomes more active in artificial intelligence , the US should double its research investments , says Kai-Fu Lee , Investor , and AI practitioners working for Google , Microsoft , and Apple .	-2.4735
These demands emerged after members of the US administration made announcements to KI , even though the US lacks a formal KI strategy .	-4.2019
Meanwhile , China presented its plan last year : by 2030 , it wants to be number 1 in the field of AI innovation .	-2.6395
“ A doubling of spending on AI research would be a good beginning , given that all other countries are far behind the US , and a breakthrough in AI research is on the brink , ” said Lee .	-5.2711
Doubling funding could double the chances of achieving the next achievement in artificial intelligence in the US , Lee CNBC said in an interview this week .	-3.2710
Lee , whose book “ AI Superpowers : China , Silicon Valley and the New World Order ( KI superpowers : China , Silicon Valley , and the new world order ) ” was published this month by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt , CEO of Sinnovation Ventures , a company that invested in one of the most famous Chinese AI companies , Face + + .	-3.6600
In the 1980s , he worked at Carnegie Mellon University on an AI system that defeated the high-ranking American Othello player , later becoming a leader at Microsoft Research and Chairman of the Google branch .	-4.8629
Lee recognized the US government ’ s previous technology competitions , such as the Robotics Challenge of the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency ( US Defense Research Authority ) , and asked when the next would take place to identify the next visionaries .	-3.4981
“ Researchers in the US often have to work very hard to obtain government grants , ” Lee said .	-2.7511
“ Not China is responsible for the outflow of high-level scientists , but companies , ” Lee noted .	-3.0124
Facebook , Google , and other technology companies have recently stopped university coryphs to work on KI .	-4.0236
Lee said that a change in immigration policy could also help the US step up its AI efforts . .	-10.6248
“ I think Green Cards should be offered automatically in KI , ” he said .	-2.2851
In July 2017 , the Chinese State Council presented its Next Generation Artificial Intelligence Development Plan .	-2.3988
China ’ s National Natural Science Foundation provides funding for people in academic institutions similar to the way in which the National Science Foundation and other government organizations distribute money to US researchers , but the quality of academic work in China is lower , said Lee . .	-8.2541
Earlier this year , the US established a Joint Artificial Intelligence Center to involve industrial and scientific partners , and the White House announced the creation of a Select Committee on Artificial Intelligence .	-3.6189
And this month , DARPA announced an investment of $ 2 billion in an initiative called “ AI Next . ”	-14.1576
As far as the NSF is concerned , it currently invests more than $ 100 million a year in AI research .	-2.7097

In a referendum , Macedonia votes on whether to change the country 's name .	-2.5041
The people of Macedonia voted on Sunday in a referendum on whether to change their name in the Republic of North Macedonia , a step that would resolve a decade-long dispute with Greece that had blocked its accession offers for the European Union and NATO .	-3.6681
Greece , which has a province called Macedonia , insists that the name of its northern neighbour constitutes a territorial claim to the Greek territory , and has vetoed its entry into NATO and the EU .	-10.1585
The two governments concluded an agreement in June on the basis of the proposed new name , but nationalist opponents argue that the change would undermine the ethnic identity of the Macedonian majority .	-10.2521
President Gjorge Ivanov said he would not vote in the referendum , and in view of a boycott campaign , there are doubts as to whether the result will create the 50 % hurdle , which is a prerequisite for the referendum 's validity .	-4.1336
The question in the referendum ballot was : ' Are you in favour of NATO and EU membership with the adoption of the agreement with Greece ? '	-2.4171
Advocates of the name change , including Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , argue that it is worth continuing to include in institutions such as the EU and NATO for Macedonia , one of the countries to emerge from the collapse of Yugoslavia .	-3.2917
“ I have come today to vote on the country ’ s future , and it is a decision for the young people of Macedonia to be able to live freely under the umbrella of the European Union , because that means a life in greater security for all of us , ” said Olivera Georgijevska , 79 , in Skopje .	-4.1908
Although not legally binding , enough Members have said they will adhere to the outcome of the vote so that it becomes decisive .	-3.3204
A two-thirds majority in Parliament is required for the name change .	-2.6399
The Committee of the Country Elections said at 13 p.m. that there were no reports of irregularities .	-5.0388

“ I voted for my children – our place is in Europe , ” said Gjose Tanevski , 62 , a voter in the capital Skopje .	-2.6424
Macedonia ’ s Prime Minister Zoran Zaev , his wife Zorica and son Dushko have voted in favour of the referendum in Macedonia on changing the country ’ s name , which would pave him the way for accession to NATO and the European Union in Strumica , Macedonia , on 30 September 2018 .	-3.4753
Before Parliament in Skopje , Vladimir Kavardarkov , 54 , prepared a small stage and placed chairs before the tents set up by those who will boycott the referendum .	-3.2523
" We are in favour of NATO and the EU , but we want to take part with the heads up , not through the door , " said Kavadarkov .	-3.5100
“ We live in a poor country , but we also have our dignity .	-1.9265
If you do not want to join us as Macedonia , we can turn to others , such as China and Russia , to join us in Euro-Asian integration . ”	-2.6914
Prime Minister Zaev says that NATO membership will bring much-needed investments to Macedonia , a country with an unemployment rate of more than 20 % .	-2.1531
“ I believe that a large majority will vote in favour , because more than 80 % of our citizens are in favour of the EU and NATO , ” said Zaev after giving his vote .	-3.6777
According to him , the result “ yes ” would be “ a reinforcement of our future . ”	-3.3104
Last Monday , the Macedonian Institute for Policy Research published the results of a survey : between 30 and 43 % of voters would thus participate in the vote – less than necessary .	-10.6836
Another survey conducted by Macedonia ’ s Telma TV found that 57 % of respondents will vote on Sunday .	-2.5399
Of those who want to participate , 70 % said they voted ‘ yes ’ .	-3.4612
The referendum will only be adopted if the turnout is over 50 % .	-2.1259
A failure of the referendum would be the first serious blow to the policy of the pro-Western government since it took office in May last year .	-2.0416
Reputation : Sergio Agüero of Manchester City overcomes the entire Brighton defense on the way to the gate .	-3.2260
Sergio Aguero and Raheem Sterling handled Brighton ’ s defense at the Manchester City-2-0 victory on Saturday at the Etihad Stadium in Manchester , England .	-3.5509
Aguero let his hit look incredibly simple in the 65th minute .	-2.9339
At the beginning of the game sequence , the Argentine storm was given a passport in the middle field .	-3.6222
He tricked three defenders of Brighton to play for free .	-2.2100
Then Agüero saw itself surrounded by three green branches .	-2.9262
He bypassed a defender before running several players on the edge of the Brighton penalty area .	-3.5144
Then he made a pass to the left and gave to Sterling .	-3.4921
The English storm took advantage of his first contact to play the ball back to Agüero , who then shot on the right – past Brighton Torwart Mathew Ryan in the right side of the gate .	-4.6117
“ Aguero has foot problems , ” said City Manager Pep Guardiola to the reporters .	-1.7860
“ We have talked about it ; it took 55 , 60 minutes .	-2.7140
That has happened .	-1.0995
Fortunately , he shot a gate at the moment . ”	-2.3196
However , it was Sterling who first led Sky Blues in the Premier League duel :	-2.6033
The gate came in the 29th minute .	-1.6810
In the game , Aguero was played deep in the territory of Brighton .	-2.3389
with a nice steep pass to Leroy Sané along the left side .	-2.3850
Sane made a few touches before he led Sterling to remote posts .	-3.1425
The Sky Blues played the ball forward into the net before they slipped out of the playing field .	-3.1861

Scherzer wants to play spoilers against rockies	-1.5515
Since the national players were excluded from Playoff competition , there was not much reason to force another start .	-3.3738
But the hard-fought Scherzer hopes to climb the hill on Sunday against the Colorado Rockies , but only if there are still playoff implications for the rockies that lead a game in front of Los Angeles Dodgers in the NL West .	-4.5573
The rockies secured at least one lead with a 5 : 2 victory over the national on Friday evening , but the title win in the first league is still not safe .	-5.1744
" Even if we play for nothing , we can at least stop because we know that the atmosphere here in Denver with the people and the other team will probably be the best that has to offer us this year .	-4.3384
Why should I not want to work ? '	-2.6578
Nationals have not yet announced a start for Sunday , but are supposedly inclined to let jokers throw in such a situation .	-4.4739
Scherzer , who would make his 34th start , took an upward tour on Thursday and threw in his normal day of rest .	-3.9995

Trump continues : “ You see this terrible , terrible radical democratic group , you can see that it is happening right now .	-3.3971
And they are determined to regain power by all the necessary means , and they do not stop at bosses and communities either .	-4.3147
They do not care who they are injured , whom they have to cross in order to get power and control , that is what they want , power and control ; we will not have them .	-12.0519
“ The Democrats ’ goal is to oppose and block , ” he said .	-6.8352

The Labour Party is no longer a broad community .	-1.4308
It is intolerant of those who say what they think .	-1.0025
When momentum activists in my local party voted to criticise me , it was hardly a surprise .	-2.2847
Finally , I am the last in a number of Labour Members who say that we are not welcome , just because we have said our opinion .	-3.4210
My group colleague , Joan Ryan , has been treated similarly because she has firmly opposed anti-Semitism .	-2.2303
In my case , I have been criticised by the motion of censure , because I disagree with Jeremy Corbyn .	-2.4127

The communication for the East Labour meeting in Nottingham on Friday states : ' We want the meetings to be inclusive and productive ' .	-2.1595
Most of my time as a local Labour MEP , the GC meetings on Friday evening were exactly the same .	-2.8851
Unfortunately , it is not the tone of many meetings today , and the promise of a ' more friendly , softer ' policy has long been forgotten when it ever started .	-3.4454
It has become increasingly clear that different views in the Labour Party are not tolerated , and any opinion is judged on whether it is acceptable to lead the party .	-4.1792
This began shortly after Jeremy ’ s inauguration , because the colleagues with whom I had previously thought I had a similar political attitude expected me to take a turn and adopt positions that I would never have agreed with , whether in terms of national security or the EU internal market .	-6.6185
Whenever I speak publicly – and it does not matter what I say – it follows a tirade of abuse in the social media that calls for election , denounces the Centre ’ s policy and tells me that I should not be in the Labour Party .	-4.3781
This experience was not just me .	-3.0326
I know , in fact , that there are more fortunes than some of my colleagues , because the comments that are addressed to me tend to be political .	-4.3059
I appreciate the professionalism and determination of my colleagues who are exposed to sexist or racist abuse every day , but never shy away .	-3.2770
One of the most disappointing aspects of this era of politics is the level of abuse that has normalized .	-2.3280
Jeremy Corbyn claimed last week that the Labour Party should promote a culture of tolerance .	-1.8417
The reality is that we are no longer the broad church and , with every motion of censure or amendment of the rules of selection , the party becomes smaller .	-3.7702
Over the last two years , I have received a lot of advice to recover my neck , not to be so loud , and then I would be “ in order . ”	-5.1874
But for this reason I have not come into politics .	-2.8411
Thirty-two years ago , as a student , I joined in Labour because of the neglect of the Thatcher Government , which had caused my classroom to literally collapse , and as a result I tried to promote better public services for those who need it most , whether as a councillor or minister .	-6.0520
I have never hidden my political views , not even at the last election .	-2.3208
As far as my political positions are concerned , nobody in Nottingham East should have been somehow confused , and the same applies to areas where I disagree with the current leadership .	-3.6233
To those who supported the Friday application , I just want to say that I do not understand why they are wasting time and energy to remain loyal to me and the Labour Party when the country is heading for a Brexit that is harmful to households , businesses and our public services .	-4.4535
But the only message I have is not about Nottingham Momentum , but to my constituents , whether Labour Members or not : I am proud to serve you , and I promise you that I will not threaten me to choose or political opportunities from working in what I think is the best interest of all of you .	-4.1429

Ayr 38 - 17 Melrose : Ayr unbeaten at the top of the hill .	-8.9779
Two late Tries may have distorted the final result somewhat , but there is no doubt that Ayr deserves to win in this wonderfully entertaining Tennent 's Premiership Match of the day .	-3.8302
You now lead the table as the only unbeaten of the ten teams .	-2.7352
After all , it was due to the outstanding defence of the host , but also to the fact that opportunities were better exploited , and the coach Peter Murchie was extremely pleased with . .	-18.7533
" We were tested so far by our games and we are still unbeaten , so I must be happy , " he said .	-2.7536
Robyn Christie von Melrose said : “ Thanks to Ayr , they have better exploited their opportunities . ”	-2.6160
Grant Anderson ’ s attempt at the 14th minute , transformed by Frazier Climo , brought Ayr forwards , but a yellow card for Scotland ’ s captain Rory Hughes , who was given for the game of Warriors , allowed Melrose to speak numbers , and Jason Baggot to gain an unchanged attempt .	-13.0544
Climo reached the leadership of Ayr with a punishment before reaching a hit directly at the half-time and then making a solo appeal to him in the 17 : 5 pause for Ayr .	-8.0853
However , Melrose began the second half time well and Patrick Anderson 's attempt to transform Baggot , reduced the backwardness to five points .	-3.5919
After the reboot , Ayr built the lead when a Try was transformed by Stafford McDowall-by Climo .	-5.6020
Ayr 's current captain Blair Macpherson got the yellow card , and again Melrose paid the additional man with an unconverted Bruce Colvine attempt , at the end of a curse of intense pressure .	-4.1281
However , the home page came back and when Struan Hutchinson received a yellow card for a tackling without ball from the penalty border , MacPherson made a touchdown , the advancing Ayr at the back .	-5.1888
Climo converted as almost after rebooting after Kyle Rowe David Armstrong 's boxkick and sent the wing storm Gregor Henry by pass to Try number five .	-4.2055

Throughout the enclosed Bolivia , the memory of a coast lost to Chile in a bloody 19th century resource conflict is still alive , as is the desire to return to the Pacific .	-4.1260
These hopes may have been at their peak for decades , as Bolivia is waiting for a judgment of the International Court on 1 October after five years of deliberations .	-3.2740
" Bolivia has the dynamics , the spirit of unity and the calm and , of course , expects the result with a positive view , " said Roberto Calzadilla , a Bolivian diplomat .	-3.9137
Many Bolivians will follow the judgment of the International Court of Justice on large screens throughout the country , and hope that the tribunal in The Hague will favour Bolivia ’ s claim that , after decades of troubled talks , Chile will have to negotiate in order to give Bolivia sovereign access to the sea .	-4.2163
For Evo Morales , Bolivia ’ s charismatic Indian president – facing a controversial fight for re-election next year – much depends on Monday ’ s decision .	-2.9642
“ We are about to regain access to the Pacific Ocean , ” he praised at the end of August .	-2.0927
Some analysts , however , find it unlikely that the Court will decide in favour of Bolivia and believe that even a positive decision for Bolivia will not bring about change .	-3.4736
The Dutch UN body has no power to award Chilean territory and has established that it will not determine the outcome of possible talks .	-3.1063
The fact that the judgment of the International Court of Justice came about only six months after hearing the final arguments shows that the case was ' not complicated ' , Paz Zárate , a Chilean expert on international law .	-3.4098
And far from pushing Bolivia ’ s cause , the last four years may have stopped .	-3.3031
“ The question of sea access is being used by the current Bolivian government for its purposes , ” Zárate said .	-3.1128
Morales ’ warrior rhetoric had destroyed any remaining Chilean goodwill , it proposed .	-3.1913
Bolivia and Chile will eventually resume the negotiations , but it will be difficult to continue the talks afterwards .	-2.8445

Ri spoke at the United Nations General Assembly on Saturday .	-1.3559
He called on the United States to honour the promises made during a Singapore summit of the two rival leaders .	-2.8658
His statements come at a time when US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo appears to resume diplomatic talks on nuclear disarmament three months after the meeting with the North Korean dictator Kim Jong Un in Singapore .	-2.6871
Ri says it is “ a dream ” that continues to impose sanctions and the US contradiction of a declaration ending the Korea War will ever force the North on its knees .	-4.6349

Independent schools in Scotland have a success balance of academic top quality , which continued in 2018 with outstanding examination results , including individual and group successes in sport , art , music and other Community enterprises .	-5.5808
With more than 30,000 students across Scotland , these schools , represented by the Scottish Council of Independent Schools ( SCIS ) , aim to offer their students and parents the best service .	-3.1340
Independent schools are designed to prepare pupils – for further training , including at universities , their desired professional careers and their role as a world citizen .	-4.3913
In the education sector , we have the opportunity to develop and implement a tailor-made school curriculum , and we note that modern languages remain popular and desirable in schools .	-3.9739

This impressively demonstrates that we cannot rely solely on the English language if we are to build relations and trust with people from other countries .	-3.4355
The examination results this year show that languages lead the tables with the highest rates of existence in independent schools .	-3.1966
68 percent of students who have studied foreign languages have reached the so-called “ Higher grade A class A ” .	-10.2131
The data collected by the 74 SCIS member schools showed that 72 percent of students reached a “ Higher grade A ” in Mandarin , while Note A reached 72 , 69 and 63 among the students who learned German , French and Spanish . in , , , , , , and , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.1597

A British Employment and Qualifications Commission poll in 2014 found that 17 % of the reasons why employers had difficulty filling free jobs caused a lack of language skills .	-4.7147
Therefore , language skills are becoming increasingly necessary to prepare young people for their professional future .	-2.9178
Given more promising employment opportunities that require languages , these skills are essential in a globalized world .	-2.8060
Irrespective of the career that someone chooses when learning a second language , he has a real advantage in the future with a lifelong ability like this .	-4.3857
With the opportunity to communicate directly with people from abroad , a multilingual person will automatically be ahead of competitors .	-2.7611
According to a YouGov survey of more than 4,000 adults in the United Kingdom in 2013 , 75 % were unable to speak a foreign language well enough to hold a conversation , and French is the only language spoken with a two-digit percentage , namely 15 % .	-3.1931
That is why the current investment in language teaching is important for today 's children .	-2.8004
When children learn to speak multiple languages – particularly those of developing countries – they will have a better chance of finding meaningful employment in the labour market later on .	-3.9158
Schools in Scotland are different from their language offerings .	-2.5139
Some schools focus on classical modern languages , while others will teach the most important languages for Britain in 2020 , such as Mandarin or Japanese .	-3.3220

Indeed , modern languages should be truly regarded as “ international communication capabilities . ”	-1.7975
Independent schools will continue to offer young people in Scotland this choice , diversity and top quality .	-1.9543

Trump ’ s Rally in West Virginia , YouTube Channel	-1.3245
President Donald Trump begins this evening in Wheeling , West Virginia , with a flood of campaign events .	-2.1596
It is the first of five planned election events next week , with Trump also visiting the Republican-friendly states of Tennessee and Mississippi .	-3.5805
While his Supreme Court candidate ’ s confirmation remains outstanding , Trump must mobilize his electorate for the forthcoming midterm elections , otherwise fearing that Republicans will lose the majority in Congress when elected in November .	-5.1819
When is Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye this evening and how can you view it online ?	-2.7663
Trump 's Rally in Wheeling , West Virginia , is scheduled for 19 p.m. ET this evening , Saturday , September 29 , 2018 .	-2.5895
You can track down Trump ’ s West Virginia Rallye online via live stream on YouTube .	-2.0326
Trump will certainly respond to the hearings held this week concerning the allegations of sexual abuse against his Supreme Court candidate , Brett Kavanaugh , whose confirmation by the Senate was postponed by at least one week until the FBI ’ s investigations were completed .	-5.4149
The main goal of these electoral events , however , is to mobilise the Republicans , who will face a crucial election in November .	-3.7839
According to Reuters , the aim of Trump ’ s campaign is to mobilize volunteers and supporters next week to defend and expand the majority of Republicans in the Senate and House of Representatives .	-14.3591
“ The majority in Congress is at the presidential agenda , which is why he is visiting as many states as possible just before the turbulent election season starts , ” a spokesman of the Trump campaign , who does not want to be named , told Reuters .	-5.7891
According to the West Virginia MetroNews radio network , the electoral event in Wesbanco Arena in Wheeling this evening could attract supporters from Ohio and Pennsylvania , and attract the attention of the Pittsburgh media .	-12.1868
On Saturday , Trump West Virgina , the federal state that he won with more than 40 percentage points in 2016 , will visit for the second time this month .	-2.3200
Trump is trying to help the Republican candidate for the Senate of West Virginia , Patrick Morrisey , who is lagging behind in the polls .	-2.4298
According to Reuters , Simon Haeder , Politologist at the University of West Virginia said that it is not a good sign for Morrisey that the president must come to improve his poll values .	-3.5218
Ryder Cup 2018 : The USA team is ready to fight to sustain hope for Sunday singles .	-3.2948
After three unilateral meetings , the four-player games on Saturday afternoon were probably exactly what the Ryder Cup needed .	-3.2141
The swinging pendulum is a freely invented sports concept that players have internalized , especially in competitions like this .	-3.3785
So where would they say the momentum is now ?	-1.7762
“ You had a six-point lead , and now there are four , so it is a bit of a momentum , ” Jordan Spieth said when he withdrew for the day . ”	-4.6738
Europe , of course , has a four-point advantage , with twelve more to play .	-3.8717
But the Americans , as Spieth says , feel a little wind in their sails and there was a lot of encouragement for them , not least the form of Spieth and Justin Thomas , who played together all day and have three of four points each .	-4.5648
Spieth was superior from the very beginning and set an example .	-2.7990
These cautious cry became louder when his round went on , he sunk a decisive putt to reach a draw in game 4 after he and Thomas dropped 2 points after 2 games .	-6.4528
His joy at the putt on the 15th hole with which she won the game was so that one thought he still believed in the victory of the Americans .	-3.4994
" You really have to concentrate and worry about your own game , " said Spieth .	-3.3871
This is all that remains for each player .	-3.2788
18 holes to leave impression .	-1.5494
In the last two days , Francesco Molinari and Tommy Fleetwood were the only players with more points than Spieth and Thomas .	-2.4437
Europe ’ s strange but admirable couple is playing errors and just doing everything right .	-4.3306
" Moliwood " was the only couple who did not get a bogey on Saturday afternoon , but they also avoided it on Saturday morning , Friday afternoon and Friday morning the rear nine .	-3.5883
This run and the way in which their energy appears to flow from this abandoned spectator set makes it a favorite on Sunday and when the sun sets over Le Golf National , there would be no more popular player who sealed a possible European victory than Fleetwood or Molinari .	-5.6174
Probably both on different holes at the same time .	-2.4280
Talking about a European victory is too premature .	-2.4391
Bubbba Watson and Webb Simpson made short trial with Sergio Garcia , who was victorious in the morning with his partner Alex Noren .	-2.6974
With a bogey and two doubles on the first nine , the Spaniard and Swede pit into a hole they never came out of .	-4.4481
On Sunday there is no one who helps you out of your hole .	-2.8556
Because of the interactions between the couples , the given advice , the non-given advice and the way a strategy can change at once , it is very fascinating to observe the fourballs and foursomes close by .	-4.7723
Europe has played better as a team and has taken a clear lead in the last day , but this Foursome session has also shown that the US team has the pleasure of fighting , as some , particularly statesides , have doubted .	-6.0551
Europe leads 10-6 on the Ryder Cup Final Day .	-6.1199
Europe will take a solid advantage on the last day of the Ryder Cup after it emerged from four and four games on Saturday with a 10-6 lead over the United States .	-4.2788
The inspired Duo Tommy Fleetwood and Francesco Molinari led the group with two victories over a fighting Tiger Woods to bring its previous record at Le Golf National to four points .	-3.6528
The European team of Thomas Bjorn , who took over the preservation of the trophy she lost two years ago in Hazeltine , dominated an American team fighting with suspension , and won the series 3-1 .	-4.0685
The US offered more resistance in the four and won two games , but it could not digest the deficit .	-2.2918
The team of Jim Furyk needs eight points from the 12 individual games on Sunday to keep the trophy .	-11.6044
Fleetwood is the first European rookie to win four points in a row while he and Molinari , after a sensational weekend " Molliwood " , are only the second couple who wins four points from their first four games in the history of the Ryder Cup .	-3.8548
Having destroyed Woods and Patrick Reed into the Fourball , it was considered certain that they would beat an even clearer 5 & 4 woods and the American Rookie Bryson Dechambeau .	-4.6860
Woods , who wrecked through two parties on Saturday , occasionally showed brilliant actions , but he has now lost 19 of his 29 parties in four balls and four and seven in a row .	-4.6623
Justin Rose , rested for the morning fourballs , returned to his partner Henrik Stenson in the Foursomes and failed in a 2 & 1 defeat Dustin Johnson and Brooks Koepka – place one and three in the world .	-4.4226
However , on a pleasant , airy day southwest of Paris , Europe did not have it in its own way .	-2.5663
The triple main winners Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas set the benchmark for the Americans on Saturday with two points .	-2.9096
They won a brave 2 : 1 victory against the Spaniard Jon Rahm and Ian Poulter in the fourth pack and later returned to beat Poulter and Rory McIlroy 4 : 3 in the fourth pack after they lost the first two holes .	-3.7816
Only twice in the Ryder Cup history , a team returns from a four-point deficit to the singles , although Halter Furyk 's page needs only one draw to keep the trophy .	-4.6457
Two days later , however , a Sunday Conter looks like it would go beyond it .	-3.9595
North Korea says that there will be “ no way ” unilateral disarmament without trust .	-2.2574
North Korea ’ s Foreign Secretary said to the United Nations on Saturday that the continued sanctions would deepen its distrust of the United States , and that it would not , under such circumstances , give up its nuclear weapons unilaterally .	-3.7556
Ri Yong Ho said to the World Cup ’ s annual General Assembly that North Korea took ' important goodwill measures ' last year , such as the cessation of nuclear and missile tests , the dismantling of the nuclear test grounds and the obligation not to disseminate nuclear weapons and nuclear technology .	-4.3444
" There is no response from the USA , " he said .	-2.9902
“ Without confidence in the US , there will be no confidence in our national security , and in such circumstances there is no way that we will first disarm ourselves unilaterally . ”	-3.2356
While Ri resumed the well-known North Korean complaints about Washington ’ s resistance to a “ gradual ” approach to denuclearization that would reward North Korea with gradual steps , his statement seemed significant in that it did not entirely reject unilateral denuclearization , as Pyongyang did in the past .	-4.2086
Ri referred to a joint statement by Kim Jong Un and Donald Trump at a first summit between an acting US president and a North Korean leader in Singapore on 12 June , when Kim committed to " denuclearizing the Korean Peninsula , " while Trump promised guarantees for North Korea ’ s security .	-3.6068
North Korea sought a formal end to the Korea War in 1950-53 , but the United States said that Pyongyang must abandon his nuclear weapons first .	-2.6525
Washington has also opposed the demands for easing the hard international sanctions against North Korea .	-2.7902
The USA insists on " denuclearization-first " ( first denuclearization ) and increases pressure through sanctions to achieve their purpose in a mandatory manner , and even reject the " declaration of the end of the war " , said Ri .	-4.3916
" The perception that sanctions can bring us to our knees is a dream of the people who are ignorant of us .	-2.4740
But the problem is that continued sanctions are exacerbating our distrust . ”	-1.8867
Ri mentioned no plans for a second summit between Kim and Trump , which the US President emphasised at the United Nations earlier this week .	-2.7405
Instead , the Minister raised three meetings between Kim and South Korean leader Moon Jae-in the last five months and added : ' If the party were to denuclearize South Korea and not the US , the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula would not have come to such a deadlock ' .	-4.5198
Nonetheless , the tone of Ri ’ s speech was dramatically different from last year , when he reported to the U.N. , the General Assembly that targeted the US mainland with North Korea ’ s rockets was inevitable after “ Mr. Evil President ” Trump Kim called “ a rocket man ” on a suicide mission .	-5.1528
This year at the United Nations , Trump , who threatened to “ completely destroy ” North Korea last year , praised Kim for his courage to take steps to disarm , but he also said that a lot of work had to be done , and sanctions must remain until North Korea destroyed denuclearization .	-3.8589
On Wednesday , Trump said that he had no timeframe for this and said : ' It does not matter whether it takes two years , three years , or five months ' .	-3.5083
China and Russia argue that the UN Security Council should reward Pyongyang for the steps taken .	-1.4733
However , in the US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said to the UN , Security Council on Thursday , that ' the enforcement of the Security Council sanctions must be vigorously and without lack until we achieve complete , definitive and verified denuclearization ' .	-5.1611
Since 2006 , the Security Council has unanimously increased sanctions against North Korea to prevent funding for the Pyongyang nuclear and ballistic missile programmes .	-2.6031
Pompeo met Ri on the margins of the UN General Assembly and then said he will go back to Pyongyang next month to prepare for a second summit .	-2.9729
Pompeo has already visited North Korea three times this year , but his last trip did not go well .	-1.9878
He left Pyongyang in July and said that progress had been made , and only a few hours later North Korea sentenced him to “ similar demands ” .	-3.7196
North Korea promised this month at a meeting with Moon to dismantle a missile and also a nuclear complex if the United States adopts ' appropriate measures ' .	-3.6887
He said Kim said to him that the ' appropriate measures ' he wanted to provide security guarantees that Trump promised in Singapore , and steps to normalize relations with Washington .	-3.5850
Harvard students take part in the course to find enough peace .	-2.5035
With a new course this year at Harvard University , all students get more sleep to fight against the growing macho culture of studying the caffeine reported " mixed nights " .	-5.3472
A scientist has found that students at a world leading university are often unsuspecting when it comes to helping themselves , even when it comes to very simple mechanisms .	-3.1471
Charles Cheisler , professor of sleep medicine at the Harvard Medical School and specialist at the Brigham and Women 's Hospital , designed the course that he believes is the first of his kind in the USA .	-3.9298
It was inspired to start the course after giving a talk about the impact of lack of sleep on learning .	-3.3362
In the end , a girl came to me and said : " Why is it only now , in my closing year , that ?	-4.5038
She said that you have never told anyone about the meaning of the sleep – what surprised me , " he told the telegraph .	-3.5159
The course offered this year for the first time explains to students how good sleeping habits promote academic and sporting performance and improve their general well-being .	-3.6953
Paul Barreira , professor of psychiatry at the Harvard Medical School and Managing Director of the University Health Service , said that the university has decided to introduce the course after it discovered that students had slept extremely little during the week .	-4.4584
The 1-hour course includes a number of interactive tasks .	-1.7807
In a section there is an image of a sleeping room where students click on coffee alleys , curtains , trainers and books to be informed about the effects of caffeine and light , and how sporting performance influences by lack of sleep and the meaning of a sleeping time routine .	-5.6116
Another section explains how long-term sleeping can increase the risk of heart attack , stroke , depression and cancer .	-3.3095
A map of the campus with interactive symbols encourages participants to think about their daily lives .	-2.4039
We know that student behaviour will not change immediately .	-1.7695
" But we believe they have a right to do so - just as you have a right to know the health effects of the decision to smoke cigarettes , " Prof. Czeisler added .	-3.0146
The culture of pride still exists , he said and added that modern technology and increasing pressure on pupils and students makes sleeping a growing problem .	-3.5325
Having enough sleep of good quality should be the " secret weapon " of a student to combat stress , exhaustion and fear , he said - also to avoid increasing , since sleeping is putting the brain into hunger mode and making it constantly hungry .	-5.2338
Raymond So , a 19-year-old Californian student of chemical and physical biology , helped Professor Czeisler design the course after visiting one of his classes last year in Harvard .	-3.2579
He said that the course had opened his eyes and inspired him to pursue a campus-wide course .	-2.4693
The next step , he hopes , is to call on all doctoral candidates to complete a similar study programme before entering the Competition College .	-9.1889
Prof. Czeisler recommended that students alert when to go into bed and wake up , and be aware of the harmful effects of the " blue light " that is broadcast by electronic screens and LED lighting , which can eliminate their circadian rhythm , causing problems in sleeping .	-5.7717
Livingston 1-0 Rangers : Mengas Goal earns Gerrard 's men from Men .	-3.3991
Further external problems of the Rangers : After a hit by Dolly Menga , the 1-to-0 defeat for the unique Steven Gerrard team came in Livingston .	-5.4763
The Ibrox team wanted to record their first victory since February 4 : 1 triumph in St. Johnstone , but the team of Gary Holt added Gerrard ’ s second defeat in 18 games as trainer , leaving his team at eight points behind the disappointed Ladbrokes Prime Minister Hearts .	-5.2622
Menga landed a hit seven minutes before the half-time , and an inspirational Rangers setup did not look like they could compensate .	-5.0224
While the Rangers now fall back to sixth place , Livingston ranks three and lies only because of the gateway difference behind Hibernian .	-4.6221
New difficulties for the rangers are emerging , as a headwound had to be supplied to the Calum Spence referee after he was hit by a litter – apparently thrown off by the external fans sector .	-6.6305
Gerrard made eight changes to side that passed to Ayr and captured directly into the semi-final of the Betfred CCup .	-4.8228
By contrast , Holt had the same Livi-Elf that took off the Hearts last week , and he would have been enthusiastic about how his well trained team never allowed opponents space for action at any time .	-7.0741
The Rangers dominated ball ownership , but Livingston did better .	-3.6428
You should have met after just two minutes when Mengas sent first Scott Pittman to Allan McGregors Tor , but the midfield player passed his great chance at the gate .	-5.6339
A deep release of Keaghan Jacobs then went to Captain Craig Halkett , but his defensive partner Alan Lithgow could only shoot far toward rear posts .	-4.0329
The Rangers took control , but there seemed to be more hope than eternal in their own game , in the last third .	-3.3970
After the first quarter of an hour , Alfredo Morelos clearly believed that he had earned an penalty after conflicting with Steven Lawless , but arbitrator Steven Thomson did not respond to the appeals of the Colombian . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.7434
The rangers arrive only two shots in the first half , but the former Ibrox goalkeeper Liam Kelly was hardly of Lassana Coulibaly ’ s head jump and hit a bissless Ovie Ejaria .	-5.4553
Although Livi ’ s opening meeting may have been opposed to the game course in the 34th minute , no one can deny that they have earned it for their efforts alone .	-4.8491
Again , the rangers failed to master a Jacobs standard situation .	-1.7118
Scott Arfield did not react when Declan Gallagher Scott Robinson played the ball that kept the calm and picked Menga out for a simple finish .	-3.3017
Gerrard acted during the break when he exchanged Coulibaly for Ryan Kent and the change immediately affected the game when the wing player played to Morelos , but the impressive Kelly ran from his line to block .	-3.6251
But Livingston kept pushing guests to play exactly the kind of game they like , with Lithgow and Halchatt running long balls after long balls .	-4.4646
Holt ’ s team could have expanded their leadership in the final phase , but McGregor stood up well to deny Jacobs before Lithgow left the corner .	-4.6421
The Rangers representative Glenn Middleton had another delayed claim to punish him as he devastated with Jacobs , but once again he saw Thomson looking away .	-5.0590
Almanach : The inventor of the violin counter	-2.7335
And now one of our almanach “ Sunday morning ” : 30 September 1882 , which was more than 136 years ago ... The day when the future physicist Johannes Wilhelm , called Hans , Geiger , was born in Germany .	-3.5796
More violent developed a method for identifying and measuring radioactivity , an invention that eventually brought about the device known as the Geiger Teller . . in , , in , , in , , , , in	-10.6414
Since then , the counter has also become a mainstay of science , as in the 1950s of the film " Bells of Coronado " , which seems to be accumulating unlikely cowpoke scientists Roy Rogers and Dale Evans :	-4.7560
Man : ' What about everything in the world is that ? '	-2.2458
Rogers : “ It is a violinist who is used to find radioactive minerals like uranium .	-2.5364
If you set these headphones , you can actually hear the effects of the atoms released by radioactivity in the minerals . ”	-2.9163
Evans : “ Tell me , now it is cracking ! ”	-2.5232
Hans Geiger died in 1945 , just a few days before his 63rd birthday .	-1.3916
But the invention bearing its name will continue to be used .	-1.9910
New vaccine can teach the immune system to “ see ” malignant cells .	-1.9075
New vaccine can teach the immune system to " see " and kill malignant cells .	-1.9459
Vaccine teaches the immune system to recognize malignant cells as part of the treatment .	-1.7530
The process involves extracting immune cells from a patient , modifying them in the laboratory .	-3.2055
You can then see a protein that is common to many types of cancer and then inject again .	-2.9044
A study vaccine shows promising results for patients with a number of cancers .	-1.9804
A woman treated with the vaccine that attracts the immune system to identify rogue cells saw her ovary cancer disappear for more than 18 months .	-14.3634
The method is to extract immuncells from a patient , to change them in the laboratory , so that a protein called HER2 becomes “ visible ” , which occurs in many types of cancer , and then to reinject cells .	-3.7949
Professor Jay Berzofsky of the US National Cancer Institute in Bethesda , Maryland , said : ' Our results indicate that we have a very promising vaccine . '	-2.1415
HER2 “ promotes the growth of various types of cancer ” , including breast , egg stock , lung and intestinal cancer , explained Prof. Berzofsky .	-3.6615
A similar approach to seeing immune cells from patients and teaching them how to attack cancer cells has worked in treating a kind of leukaemia .	-2.9308
After his appearance at Saturday Night Live , Kanye West , clothed with MAGA hat , made a pro-Trump tirade from the stack .	-4.3751
It did not go well .	-1.4496
During a Saturday Night Live program , Kanye West was booked after a divorcing speech in which he praised the US , President Donald Trump and said he will take off in 2020 .	-5.9399
After listening to his third song of the night , Ghost Town , while wearing a Make America Great Mütte , he stood against the Democrats , and affirmed his support for Trump .	-3.2295
" So often I speak to a white person , saying , “ How can you like Trump , he is a racist ? ”	-3.0669
Well , if I were concerned about racism , I would have been leaving America long ago , " he said .	-2.8819
The Saturday Night-Live show began with a sketch in which Hollywood-Star Matt Damon made fun about Brett Kavanaugh ’ s statement before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee on Christine Blasey Ford ’ s accusations that Kavanaugh sexually obliged them .	-4.5946
Although it was not broadcast , the film material of Western Gewätz was divided into social media by comedian Chris Rock .	-3.8055
It is unclear whether Rock has tried to mock West with the contribution .	-8.9608
West , too , complained to the audience that he had difficult behind the stage because of his head cover .	-3.9089
" They harassed me behind the stage .	-2.1784
You said ' Don 't go with the hat out there ' .	-2.9209
You have annoyed me !	-2.0597
And then they say that I am in a place abandoned , " he said , according to the Washington Examiner .	-2.5615
West continued : " Want to see the sunken place ? " and said that he would attract " my superman circumstance , because that means you can 't tell me what I should do . you want the world to move forward ?	-5.8230
Try it with love . ”	-1.3518
His comments were received by the audience at least twice and Saturday Night Live ’ s comediants seemed to have been relocated , reported variety and quoted a person with the words “ The whole studio was dead style . ”	-5.9205
West was later used to replace the singer Ariana Grande , whose former friend , Rapper Mac Miller , died a few days ago .	-2.7470
West wondered many with a performance of the song " I Love it " , when Perrier Bottle dressed .	-3.5666
West received support from the head of the conservative group TPUSA , Candace Turner , twittering : " This is for one of the most courageous spirits : DANKE , DASS DICH DER MAFIA WIDERSETZT HAST . "	-10.0070
But talkmasterin Karen Hunter twittered that West is simply " what he is , and that is absolutely wonderful " .	-2.3802
“ But I will not reward anyone ( buying his music or clothing or supporting his art ) , which I believe he accepts and disseminates an ideology that is harmful to my community . ”	-3.5232

" Game of Thrones " -Star Kit Harington lives toxic masculinity from Toxic . .	-10.4876
Kit Harington is known for his savvy role as Jon Snow in the brachial medieval fantasy series Game of Thrones by HBO .	-3.2317
But the actor , 31 , has annoyed the stereotype of the macho hero and has said that such roles on the canvas lead to the feeling that small boys often need to be hard to be respected .	-4.3234

The information was published online on Thursday , posted by an unknown person on the capitol hill during a hearing of the Senate on the allegations of sexual misconduct against the candidate for the Supreme Court Brett Kavanaugh .	-3.6434
The data of the three senators were published shortly after the Kavanaugh survey .	-2.0951
Conservative websites such as Gateway Pundit and RedState reported that the IP address identifying the source of posts was associated with Waters ' office and published the information of an employee of Waters reports Hill .	-3.8959
“ This unfounded accusation is completely wrong and an absolute lie , ” Waters continues .	-3.0884
“ The employee among my colleagues – whose identity , personal information , personal data and security were affected as a result of these fraudulent and false allegations – was in no way responsible for leaving this information .	-4.0601
This untenable claim is completely wrong and an absolute lie .	-2.4852
Water ’ s statement quickly led to criticism online , including the former press secretary of the White House Ari Fleischer .	-2.4821
“ The denial of the matter is extremely annoying , ” he wrote meat .	-3.0500
“ This suggests that she is unsuitable as a member of Congress .	-2.7577
If someone is accused of having done something , he must not be evil .	-2.6003
They must not be patronising .	-3.0752
You must not question the motives of the plaintiff .	-2.2050
They must be calm and left ” .	-2.3424
Meat seemed to compare Water ’ s response to the Democrats ’ criticism of Judge Kavanaugh , accused by critics of appearing angry during Thursday ’ s hearing .	-3.3430
Omar Navarro , a Republican candidate who runs alongside sitttless Water in the midterm elections , also expressed his thoughts on Twitter .	-10.5807
“ Big , if true , ” he has tweeted .	-1.8915
In her statement , Waters said that her office ' informed the competent authorities and law enforcement authorities of the fraudulent claims .	-11.0582
“ We will ensure that the perpetrators are held to account and continue to hold them accountable for their actions , which have a destructive and dangerous impact on my employees . ”	-3.9805
Review of " Johnny English – You live only three times " – badly occupied parody with Rowan Atkinson .	-3.0954
It is a tradition to seek indications in any new film with British tendency for Brexit , which seems to be applicable to this revival of the Johnny English Action-Comedy-Spoof franchise , which began in 2003 with Johnny English and was re-established in 2011 with " Johnny English Reborn " .	-5.3418
Is the ironic self-confidence about the abyss of humanity the new export capacity of the nation ?	-4.0624
In any case , the glossy , rubber-layered and incompetent Johnny English has received the license to massage things again for the second time .	-25.2873
He is , of course , the stupid secret agent who , despite his bizarre claims at Smoothie Glamour , has received a little Clouseau , an injector Mr. Bean and a clack from this guy , has contributed a single touch to the guiding logo of the fire brigade at the opening ceremony of the 2012 Olympic Games in London .	-6.6325
It is also based on travellers and international , mysterious Atkinson , who once played a part in the now forgotten Barclaycard TV shows , always leaving chaos .	-4.1997
There are one or two nice moments in this latest Johnny English comedy .	-1.4930
I loved Johnny English , who is approaching a helicopter in a medieval armor and shortly against his helmet .	-3.6990
Atkinson 's talent for body comedy is to be seen , but the humor feels rather weak and strangely superfluous , especially as the " serious " film brands such as 007 and mission Impossible self-confident comedy offer as ingredient .	-3.7028
The humor feels as if he is more directed towards children than adults , and for me the mad misfortunes of Johnny English are not as inventive and focused as Atkinson ’ s Mr. Bean Stumm films .	-4.5804
The everlasting premise is that Britain is in great difficulty .	-8.9797
A cyber hacker has infiltrated the British secret network of spies and revealed the identity of all British agents on the ground , horrifying the serviceable agent – a sadly small role for Kevin Eldon .	-3.9086
Emma Thompson is doing her best with this quasi-Teresa May figure , but there is not much in the screenplay with which to work .	-4.2985
Their intelligence advisers inform them that , as every single active spy has been compromised , they have to get someone out of their retirement .	-4.0606
And that means , Johnny English himself , who is now a schoolmaster in a noble institution , but gives unsurpassed lessons about how to operate as an Undercover agent : some nice gags here while English offers a school of rock academy about spying .	-5.4008
English is returned to Whitehall for an emergency briefing and reunited with his former , long-suffering Kumpel Bough , played again by Ben Miller .	-2.9749
Bough is now a married man who meets a submarine commander , an over-in burschikose , where Vicki Pepperdine is not enti.	-5.8092
So the Batman and Robin of Chaos at the Secret Service of their Majesty are back in action and meet on Olga Kurylenko 's beautiful Femme Fatale Ophelia Bulletova .	-3.7347
Meanwhile , the Prime Minister runs dangerously into the charismatic tech billionaire , claiming to be able to solve Britain ’ s computer problems : the dark Jason Volta , played by Jake Lacy .	-3.3503
English and Bough begin their Odyssey of Colorful Highjinks : When waiters , they inflamm a French Flash restaurant ; they create chaos by smuggling on board Voltas Luxury Yacht ; and English triggers pure anarchy as he tries to familiarise himself with a Virtual Reality headset with the inside of Voltas House .	-5.6226
For this last sequence , all the registers have certainly been drawn , but as lovingly and abandoned , it is reminiscent of children 's television .	-5.3637
Moderate .	-1.5901
And , as with the other Johnny English films , I could not help thinking : can the British film industry Rowan Atkinson not give a role that really does justice to its talent ?	-4.4197
Labour denies having developed a plan for Britain for a four-day week for which five days are paid .	-4.0595
Jeremy Corbyn ’ s Labour Party is examining a radical plan in which Britons work only four days a week but are paid for five .	-3.2766
According to reports , the Party wants corporate leaders to pass on the savings achieved by the AI revolution to workers by releasing them an extra day .	-4.1186
Employees would enjoy a three-day weekend - but still bring the same money back home .	-3.0443
Sources said that the idea would ' fit ' with the party 's economic agenda and plans to tilt the country in favour of workers .	-3.3144
The Trade Union Congress approved the switch to a four-day week as an opportunity for workers to use the changing economy .	-3.6831
A high-level source from the Labour Party said the Sunday Times : a review of politics is expected to be announced before the end of the year .	-2.8151
A four-day week is an objective that is consistent with the Party ’ s approach to restoring the economic balance for workers and the Party ’ s general industrial strategy , but this objective will not be realised overnight .	-4.3707
The Labour Party would not be the first to support such an idea , as the Green Party promised a four-day working week during its 2017 election campaign .	-2.3841
However , this move is currently not supported by the entire Labour Party .	-2.7896
A Labour Party spokesman said : ' A four-day week is not a party policy and is not intended by the party ' .	-2.8554
Treasurer John McDonnell used the Labour Party Conference last week to concrete his vision for a socialist revolution in the economy .	-2.7041
Mr McDonnell said that he was determined to regain the power of ' faceless directors ' and ' profit-makers ' in utility companies .	-2.5759
The shadow chancellor ’ s plans also mean that the current shareholders of water companies may not be returning their entire share , as a Labour Government could make ' deductions ' because of alleged misconduct .	-5.5296
He also confirmed plans to invoke employees in management boards and to create Inclusive Ownership Funds to distribute 10 % of the equity capital of private sector companies to employees receiving up to 500 pounds per year .	-4.7702
Lindsey Graham and John Kennedy talk in “ 60 minutes ” about whether the FBI investigations against Kavanaugh could change their minds .	-2.4186
A ongoing FBI investigation into allegations against Judge Brett Kavanaugh has postponed the final vote to the Supreme Court by at least one week , and it also raises the question of whether the FBI ’ s investigation results could lead Republican Senators to give up their support for Kavanaugh .	-5.4752
In a Sunday interview , Scott Pelley , the “ 60 minutes ” correspondent , asked Republican senators John Kennedy and Lindsey Graham whether the FBI ’ s investigations could make them change their minds .	-11.7281
Kennedy appeared more open than his South Carolina colleague .	-1.4097
“ In any case , ” Kennedy said .	-1.8704
" I said at the beginning of the hearing that I spoke to Judge Kavanaugh .	-1.5272
I called him after that happened after this assertion came out , I said : ' Have you done it ? '	-3.9338
It was determined , targeted and unambiguous . '	-2.4947
However , Graham 's voice seemed to be measured in stone .	-2.7560
" I have an opinion on the Kavanaugh board and it would need a bomb charge , " he said .	-3.4905
“ Dr. Ford , I do not know what happened , but I know that Brett has denied the accusation , ” added Graham with a reference to Christine Blasey Ford .	-3.6482
" None of them called it could confirm it .	-2.3544
It was 36 years ago .	-1.3551
I see nothing new that changes ' .	-1.7992
'What is the Global Citizen Festival and has it ensured that poverty is reduced ? '	-2.1003
This Saturday , the Global Citizen Festival will be held in New York , with an impressive selection of stars and an equally impressive mission to end poverty in the world .	-3.6016
This year ’ s seventh Global Citizen Festival will bring together tens of thousands of people at the Great Lawn in Central Park to experience not only stars like Janet Jackson , Cardi B and Shawn Mendes , but also to raise awareness of the real goal of the event : ending extreme poverty by 2030 .	-4.4033
The Global Citizen Festival , which took place in 2012 , is an extension of the Global Poverty Project , an international interest group aimed at fighting poverty by increasing the number of people actively fighting them .	-3.0839
In order to obtain a free ticket for the event , concert visitors had a whole series of tasks or actions , such as volunteer work , email to a leader in the world , telephone call , or other useful ways of raising the goal of combating poverty and raising awareness of it .	-5.7738
But how successful has Global Citizen been with 12 remaining years to achieve its goal ?	-2.7506
Is the idea of rewarding people with a free concert , a real way of convincing people to call for action , or simply another case of so-called ' clicktivism ' - people who feel that by signing an online petition or an online application , or by sending a tweet , they would make a real difference ?	-5.2835
Global Citizen says that since 2011 , it has recorded more than 19 million “ actions ” from its supporters , pushing for a variety of different goals .	-3.6874
It is stated that these actions have motivated world leaders to make financial and political commitments worth more than $ 37 billion , which will have an impact on the lives of more than 2.25 billion people by 2030 .	-3.1927
In early 2018 , the Group introduced 390 missions and announcements from its actions , of which at least $ 10 billion has already been paid or funded .	-3.6769
The group estimates that the funds allocated have had a direct impact on nearly 649 million people around the world .	-3.0396
The Power of Nutrition , a UK partnership of investors and executive organizations committed to “ helping children to develop their full potential , ” has promised to support Rwanda with $ 35 million in ending malnutrition in the country after Global Citizens have received more than 4,700 tweets .	-4.8679
“ With the support of the British Government , donors , other governments , and global cities like you , we can make the social injustice of malnutrition one day history , ” The Power of Nutrition Ambassador Tracey Ullman announced the crowd in a live concert in London in April 2018 .	-4.0618
The group also said that after more than 5,000 actions in the United Kingdom , which aimed to improve the nutrition of mothers and children , the government will finance the " Power of Nutrition " project of 5 million women and children with food intervention .	-4.2390
In response to one of the frequently asked questions on their website , “ Why do you think that we can put an end to extreme poverty ? ? ”	-2.9132
Global citizens responded : it will be a long and difficult path - sometimes we will fall and fail .	-7.6310
Like the great civil rights and the anti-apartheid movements before us , we will succeed , because we are more powerful together .	-2.6372
The Stars Janet Jackson , Weeknd , Shawn Mendes , Cardi B and Janelle Monáe will perform in New York this year , moderated by Deborra-Lee Furness and Hugh Jackman .	-2.9791
US could use the Navy to build a “ blockade ” to hamper Russian energy exports – Home Secretary of State Secretary of the Interior – to hamper Rus. ,	-9.2139
Washington can use his navy “ if necessary ” to prevent Russian energy from reaching markets , including in the Middle East , US Home Secretary Ryan Zinke is quoted by the Washington Examiner .	-2.8859
Zinke pointed out that Russia ’ s engagement in Syria – particularly in activities at the invitation of the legitimate government – was a pretext for exploring new energy markets .	-3.2147
“ I believe that the reason they are in the Middle East is as follows : they want to negotiate energy , just as they do in Eastern Europe , the southern part of Europe , ” he said .	-9.5148
And , according to officials , there are ways to deal with this .	-2.5530
“ The United States has this capacity to ensure with our navy that sea routes are open and , if necessary , to block to ensure that its energy does not come onto the market , ” he said .	-4.7154
Zinke spoke to the participants of a Consumer Energy Alliance event , a non-profit organization that calls itself a “ voice of energy consumers ” in the US .	-3.6599
He compared Washington ’ s approach to dealing with Russia and Iran and found that they are indeed the same .	-2.8251
" The economic option for Iran and Russia is more or less to use and replace fuels , " he said , while he called Russia a " one-trick pony " with a fossil-fuel-dependent economy .	-2.9022
The opinions come , while the Trump administration was on the mission of boosting the export of its liquefied natural gas to Europe and replacing Russia , the much cheaper option for European consumers .	-3.6918
Members of the Trump administration – including US President Donald Trump himself – are therefore trying to push Germany to stop the “ inappropriate ” Nord Stream 2 pipeline project that , according to Trump , would make Berlin “ prisoner . ”	-3.2936
Moscow has repeatedly emphasised that the 11-billion dollar pipeline Nord Stream 2 , which is supposed to double the existing pipeline capacity to 110 billion cubic metres , is a purely economic project . .	-11.6328
The Kremlin argues that Washington ’ s opposition to the project is simply economic , and is an example of unfair competition .	-2.3834
“ I believe we share the view that energy cannot be an instrument to exert pressure , and that consumers should be able to choose suppliers , ” said Russian Energy Secretary Aleksandr Novak after a meeting with US Energy Secretary Rick Perry in Moscow in September .	-3.1154
The US stance has provoked a backlash from Germany , which has confirmed its commitment to the project .	-3.1605
Germany ’ s leading industrial organization , the Federal Association of German Industries ( BDI ) , has called on the US to abide by EU energy policy and the bilateral agreements between Berlin and Moscow .	-3.1198
" I have a big problem when a third state intervenes in our energy supply , " said the Federal Association of German Industry ( BDI ) , Dieter Kempf , after a meeting between Chancellor Angela Merkel and Russian President Vladimir Putin .	-2.6435

After 6 November , I will take a serious look at the presidential candidacy .	-2.2098
Warren president Donald Trump burdened during the Rural Meeting and said that he ' leads this country in the wrong direction ' .	-4.8178
" I am very concerned about what Donald Trump is doing with our democracy , " she said .	-1.7571
Warren ’ s criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court , Kandidat Brett Kavanaugh , did not leave her mouth in her criticism of Trump and his Supreme Court .	-4.0847
Warren said in a tweet on Friday : ' Of course we need a FBI investigation before we vote ' .	-2.7341
But a Thursday poll showed that a majority of Warren ’ s own voters do not believe that it should run in 2020 .	-2.7269
According to a survey by the Suffolk University Political Research Center / Boston Globe , 58 % of the " likely " Massachusetts voters said that the Senator should not run .	-2.6506
Thirty-two percent supported such a course .	-1.9441
The survey showed more support for a run of former governor Deval Patrick , with 38 percent for potential run and 48 percent against .	-3.4733
Other top-class democrats that will be discussed with regard to a possible 2020 candidacy are former Vice-President Joe Biden and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders .	-3.5478
The Associated Press reported that Biden would officially decide until January .	-1.8836

Track Palin , 26 , spent a year in Iraq after being convened in September .	-1.6516
He was arrested on Monday night for an incident involving domestic violence .	-2.5938

Palin described his arrest as “ the elephant in the room , ” saying , through her son and other veterans , “ They come back a little more harshly , coming back and wondering whether the work of her co-soldiers and the air force and all other members of the military is respected for the country . ”	-9.6972

18 states and Washington , DC , support a legal challenge to a new US policy that refuses asylum to the victims fleeing gangs or domestic violence .	-2.6836
According to NBC News , representatives from the 18 states and the district in Washington submitted an Amicus Curiae ( Friend of the Court ) to support an asylum seeker in the contest of law .	-3.3729
The full name of the plaintiff in the dispute against sessions submitted in August by the American Civil Liberties Union against the Federal Act is not known .	-3.1996

The lawyers of the states that support Grace called El Salvador , Honduras , and Guatemala , which comprise a large number of asylum seekers in the US , as nations facing profound problems with gangs and domestic violence .	-3.5987
US new asylum policy reversed a decision by the 2014 Chamber of Appeals for Immigrants that undocumented immigrants fleeing domestic violence can apply for asylum .	-3.7509
The Justice Minister of the District of Columbia Karl Racine said in an opinion on Friday that the new law ignores decades of national , federal and international law .	-2.4287
The Amicus Curiae states that , according to the Federal Law , all applications for asylum must be judged in accordance with the circumstances of the respective complaint and such action violates this principle .	-4.3988
Lawyers further argued in the writing that the policy that refuses entry to immigrants is damaging the US economy because it is more likely that these immigrants will become entrepreneurs and “ do necessary work . ”	-4.2849
Jeff Sessions General Prosecutor instructed immigration judges in June to stop granting asylum to people fleeing domestic or band power .	-4.0020
“ Asylum is up to those who have to leave their homeland for persecution on the grounds of race , religion , nationality or belonging to a particular social group or on the basis of political opinion , ” said Sessions in his statement on 11 June .	-9.5384
Asylum was never intended to alleviate all the problems , even the serious ones facing people around the world .	-3.6093

US Ambassadors accuse China of “ bullying ” propaganda advertising ”	-2.3017
A week after an official Chinese newspaper presented a four-page ad in a US daily newspaper on the mutual benefit of US trade , the US ambassador in China Beijing accused the American press of spreading propaganda .	-4.1099
U.S. President Donald Trump referred last Wednesday to China Daily 's paid plea in the Des Moines Register - the state with the most sold newspaper in Iowa - after accusing China of interfering in the US Congress elections of 6 November , which China disputes .	-4.4132
US officials claim to Reuters that Trump ’ s charge of interfering in the US elections was a new phase in an escalating Washington campaign to put pressure on China .	-3.0721
While it is normal for foreign states to place advertisements to promote trade , Beijing and Washington are currently in an escalating trade war with several rounds of tariffs on imports .	-3.3000
At an early stage of trade war , China ’ s retaliatory tariffs should accord Chinese and US experts that exporters meet in states like Iowa , where many supporters of Trump ’ s Republican Party live .	-3.7744
Terry Branstad , US Ambassador to China , and former Iowa Governor of many years , a major exporter of agricultural products to China , said that Beijing has injured American workers , farmers , and businesses .	-3.5370
China , Branstad wrote in an opinion article in the Des Moines Register on Sunday , “ this bullying is now running forcefully through propaganda ads in our own free press .	-4.5314
“ By spreading propaganda as a paid ad in the Des Moine register , China ’ s government is making use of the esteemed American tradition of freedom of expression and press , ” Branstad wrote .	-3.6737
" By contrast , you will find only limited divergent voices at the Beijing Street newspaper booth and see no real reproduction of differences of opinion that the Chinese people could have on China ’ s worrying economic development , given that the media are firmly under the control of the Chinese Communist Party , " he wrote .	-5.2024
He added that " one of China 's most prominent newspapers contradicted the offer for publication " , though he did not say which newspaper .	-9.1765
Republicans congratulate with the Kavanaugh debacle voters prior to the Midterm elections , warn analysts	-3.2053
Many of the top Republicans defended Brett Kavanaugh , a nominee that stands for the Supreme Court even though he was accused of sexual assaults , and analysts warn that they will see a counterstrike , especially of women , in the forthcoming elections .	-5.2880
The emotions were high , and most Republicans have already said that they want to vote for him .	-2.7576
These things cannot be returned , said Grant Reeher , Professor of Political Science at the Maxwell School of Syracuse University , on Saturday in an article published by The Hill .	-2.5896
Reeher said that he doubted that the last minute support of Jeff Flake ( Republican MEP for the federal state of Arizona ) is enough to reconcile angry voters .	-3.7529
“ Women will not forget what happened yesterday – they will not forget it tomorrow and not in November , ” said Karine Jean-Pierre , senior consultant and national speaker for the progressive group MoveOn on Friday , as a Washington newspaper reported .	-3.3261
On Friday morning , the demonstrators sung : “ November comes ! ” while she demonstrated in the Senate ’ s corridor when the Republicans who control the Justice Committee decided to continue with Kavanaughs nomination , despite Dr. Christine Blasey Ford , reported Mic .	-5.3604
“ Democratic enthusiasm and motivation will be immeasurable , ” said Stu Rothenberg , an impartial political analyst , the journalists .	-1.6100
“ People say that it is quite advanced , that is true .	-2.9889
But the figure could be higher , especially among suburbs and younger voters , 18-29 , who may not suffer the president but often do not vote . ”	-3.8454
Even before Ford ’ s public statement , in which she executed her allegations of sexual violence against the Supreme Court candidate , analysts noted that a backlash could follow when Republicans push the candidacy .	-4.3414
“ For the COP this has become a confusing chaos , ” said Michael Steele , former Chairman of the Republican National Committee , earlier last week , according to NBC News .	-3.5470
“ It is not simply a matter of selecting committees or of final elections , or of whether Kavanaugh is placed on the replacement bank , but rather of how the Republicans handled it and treated it , ” Guy Cecil , director of US priorities , announced that a group that helps to elect the Democrats helps the news provider .	-7.2447
But Americans are divided over what Ford and Kavanaugh say .	-2.2566
A new survey by YouGov shows that 41 percent of Ford ’ s respondents were definitely or probably believed , while 35 percent indicated that they believed definitively or probably Kavanaugh .	-4.5253
Moreover , 38 percent said that they thought Kavanaugh was likely or definitely lied during his statement , while only 30 percent said the same about Ford .	-3.3075
At the Flake initiative , the FBI is currently studying the accusations of Ford and of at least one other prosecutor , Deborah Ramirez , reported The Guardian .	-9.7650
Ford said last week before the Senate ’ s Justice Committee under oath that Kavanaugh had attacked them drunk at the age of 17 .	-3.6185
Ramirez accuses the nominee for the High Office of Judges to have dissolved his genitals before her in the 1980s at a party .	-5.2815

Tim Berners-Lee , the inventor of the Internet , establishes a startup company to compete with Facebook , Amazon and Google .	-2.6843
The current project of technological leaders , Inrupt , is a company that builds on the open source platform “ Solid ” by Berners-Lee .	-3.6854
Solid allows users to determine where their data is stored and which persons may access what information .	-3.3011
In an exclusive interview with Fast Company , Berners-Lee joked that the goal of Inrupt was to take over world domination .	-3.2196
“ We must do it now , ” he said about the startup .	-2.2182
“ It is an historic moment . ”	-1.2134
The App uses Solid technology to enable users to create their own personal data storage or POD .	-3.6641
Data storage can contact lists , task lists , calendars , music libraries and other personal or professional tools .	-2.7278
It is like Google Drive , Microsoft Outlook , Slack and Spotify all on one browser and all available at the same time .	-2.2374
The special feature of the personal online data storage is that it is entirely left to the user which access to what kind of information is possible .	-4.6649
The company calls it “ Persons Employ by Data . ”	-3.3322
According to the CEO of John Bruce , Inrupt will provide resources , processes and appropriate know-how to make solid available to a broad user .	-3.3680
The company currently consists of Berners-Lee , Bruce , a security platform purchased by IBM , some employees involved in the project and a community of voluntary programmers .	-3.2165
From this week , technology developers can create their own decentralized apps worldwide using the tools available on the Inrupt website .	-2.4926
Berners-Lee said that neither his team nor even he will talk to Facebook and Google about the comprehensive changes that will put all previous business models on the head overnight .	-3.8413
“ We will not ask for permission ” .	-2.2169

Desert Island Discs : Tom Daley felt bad because of his sexuality .	-2.9181
The Olympic Diver Tom Daley says that he grew up with the feeling that he was subdued by sexuality to all - but that gave him the motivation to succeed .	-4.9795
The 24-year-old said that he was only aware at secondary school that “ not everyone is like me . ”	-2.8652
In the first issue of Desert Island Discs at Radio 4 he presented by Lauren Laverne said he spoke publicly about the rights of homosexuals to give other “ hope . ”	-3.1308
He also said that a victory in the Olympic Games would have become less important to him after the birth of his first child .	-2.1946
The regular presenter of the long-running show , Kristy Young , has taken off for several months due to a disease .	-2.8227
Daley appeared in Laverne ’ s first program , saying that he was “ less worth ” than the others , because “ society did not accept being on men and women . ”	-12.6642
He said : “ To date , these feelings of lower value and otherwise gave me the strength and strength I needed to be successful . ”	-3.6127

“ If you go through so much in such young years ” – he took part in the Olympic Games for the first time , three years later his father died of cancer – be it difficult to find someone at the same age who experienced similar high and low .	-5.3038
The couple was in June parents of a son called Robert Ray Black-Daley , and Daley said his " whole perspective " has changed .	-2.5723
“ Last year , for me , everything was about winning a gold medal , ” he said .	-2.3959
“ But you know what , there are more important things than Olympic gold .	-2.1180
My gold medal is Robbie . ”	-0.6556
His son bears the name of his father , Robert , who died in 2011 at only 40 years of cancer diagnosis .	-2.5690
Daley said that his father did not accept that he would die , and one of the last things he asked was whether they had their tickets for London in 2012 - because he wanted to be in the first row .	-2.8848
“ I could not tell him : <unk> You will not experience sitting in the first row , Dad <unk> , ” he said .	-3.3867

I have always said that I firmly believe in the 12 players in our team , but we are dealing with a strong opponent , the best players in the world . ”	-2.4761
Enthusiastically , as his players played in a hard golf course , Björn added : " I would never be premature .	-4.0216
Tomorrow is another day .	-1.3752
Tomorrow will be the personal performances , and that is another thing .	-3.0967
It ’ s great to be out with a partner when things go well , but if you ’ re out there , your own skills as a golf player will be tested to the whole .	-5.8765
This is the message you need to send to the players : Tomorrow get the best out of . . is . .	-12.0107
Now you are passing over to your partner and you have to do the same as you are doing . ”	-4.4348
In contrast to Björn , the opponent Jim Furyk will strive to perform more individually than they do as partners , with the exception of Jordan Spieth and Justin Thomas , who brought three out of four points .	-4.9659
Furyk himself experienced such a sensational turn at the end of the day , when he was part in the winning team in Brookline , now he is one of the losers after the European team completed the “ Miracle of Medinah ” .	-4.8423

Revived shifting the timetable for Germany ’ s New War Ship	-3.3645
The German navy ’ s latest frigates should have been deployed in 2014 to replace warships from the Cold War ’ s years , with flawed systems and escalating costs , reporting local media will now take at least until next year .	-16.9793
The commissioning of the Rhineland-Palatinate , the vessel of the brand new Baden-Württemberg frigates , has now been postponed to the first half of 2019 , according to the newspaper “ The Time ” , invoking a military speaker .	-5.2673
The navy should have started ships in 2014 , but serious problems after the first delivery strained the ambitious project .	-3.2022
The four Baden-Württemberg class frigates ordered in 2007 will replace the older vessels of the Bremen class .	-3.4618
It is assumed that they have a powerful cannon , a series of aircraft defense and shipping missiles and some stealth technologies , such as reduced radar , infrared and acoustic signatures .	-4.5151
Another important advantage is longer maintenance intervals : the latest frigates can be used for up to two years without starting the homeport .	-4.5013
However , the state-of-the-art warships that are intended to enable Germany to project power overseas will already be outdated by the constant delays when they are finally put in service , as the weekly newspaper “ The Time ” notes .	-5.7290
Last year , the unfortunate F125 frigate caused headlines when the German navy officially refused to start the ship and returned it to the shipyard Blohm & Voss in Hamburg .	-4.0414
This was the first time that the navy returned a ship to a ship builder after delivery .	-2.8339
Little was known about the reasons for returning the vessels ; German media mentioned a series of critical “ software and hardware defects ” that would make the warships useless in combat missions .	-4.2074
Software deficiencies were particularly important because the Baden-Württemberg class ships are served by a crew of about 120 seafarers - only half of the crew on older Bremen class frigates .	-4.3755
It was also evident that the ship has a considerable overweight , which would restrict performance and make it difficult to upgrade to the navy in the future .	-5.5338
It is assumed that the 7,000-tonne “ Rhineland-Palatinate ” is twice as difficult as ships of the same class used by Germans in World War II .	-10.6833
In addition to incorrect hardware , the pricing sign of the entire project - including the training of the crew - is also on the subject .	-5.0752
Instead of the originally estimated EUR 2.2 billion , the costs now seem to have reached the diminishing level of EUR 3.1 billion ( some $ 3.6 billion ) .	-3.7375
The problems with the latest frigates are particularly important in the light of recent warnings that Germany ’ s sea power is disappearing .	-4.0075
Earlier this year , Hans-Peter Bartels , Chairman of the Defence Committee of the German Parliament , admitted that the fleet of war was actually “ running out the vessels capable of operating . ”	-4.3778
The official said that the problem has grown in avalanches over time , as old vessels have been left out of service , without any substitute for it .	-12.6756
He complained that none of the Baden-Württemberg frigates were in service by the Navy .	-2.8821
The National Trust looks at the secret life of bats .	-3.0781
New research on a property in the Scottish Highlands seeks to find out how bats use the landscape for food search .	-3.3757
It is hoped that this will bring new knowledge of the behaviour of unique flying mammals , which will provide guidance for future animal protection measures .	-4.3987
The study by National Trust for Scotland scientists will follow common and soprano pistes , brown long and dubenton bats in the Inverewe Gardens in Western Ross .	-4.9221
Special recording equipment is placed at the main points of the accommodation to track bat mouse activities throughout the year .	-4.0169
NHS staff and volunteers will also carry out mobile surveys with hand detectors .	-8.8287
A professional tonal analysis of all recordings determines the frequency of spot mouse calls and assigns the calls to species .	-4.5480
The habitat card and the report to be produced should provide a detailed overview of the behaviour .	-3.3232
Rob Dewar , National Trust for Scotland ( NTS ) nature consultant , hopes to find out which areas of habitat are most important for bats and how they are used by the respective species .	-4.1036
This information will help to identify the advantages of household management , such as meadow formation and how best to preserve forests for bats and other related species .	-4.0247
The bat mouse populations in Scotland and the rest of the United Kingdom have declined sharply over the past hundred years .	-4.1976
They are threatened by construction work affecting their sleeping places and the loss of habitat .	-2.7567
Wind turbines and lighting can also pose a risk , as well as flying strips and some chemical treatments of building materials .	-5.5400
The bats are not blind .	-3.3105
Adapted to their night-time hunting activities , the ears are more useful to the prey than the eyes .	-4.7121
They use sophisticated Echo positioning technology to locate errors and obstacles in their flight path .	-3.4922
The NTS , which is responsible for caring for more than 270 historic buildings , 38 important gardens and 76,000 hectares of land , takes the bats very seriously .	-3.0179
There are ten trained experts who conduct regular surveys , inspect sleeping places and sometimes make rescues .	-3.2693
The organisation has even set up Scotland 's first and only dedicated batch reserve at the Threade estate in Dumfries and Galloway , home to eight of the ten Scottish batches .	-4.7571
According to Manager David Thompson , the property is an ideal habitat for them :	-2.0841
“ Here in Threave we have a great area for bats . ”	-2.5092
" We have the old buildings , many old trees and all the good habitat .	-1.9837
But there is still much unknown about bats and the work we do here and on other land helps us to understand better what they need to live . ”	-3.2497
He emphasizes that it is important to check before maintenance in buildings whether bats are there , and according to which it is possible that , in the accidental destruction of a single sleeping place , up to 400 females and boys are killed – a whole local population may be wiped out .	-6.8841
Bats are protected ; it is forbidden to kill , harass or disturb them and destroy their sleeping places .	-3.6207
Elisabeth Ferrell , Scottish employee of Bat Conservation Trust , has encouraged the public to help .	-8.7617
She said : “ We still have much to learn about our bats , and for many of our species we simply do not know how their populations are . ”	-2.9921
Ronaldo denies rape claims when lawyers sue German magazine .	-2.7092

The storm from Portugal and Juventus was accused of raping an American named Kathryn Mayorga in a hotel room in Las Vegas in 2009 .	-2.2062
He then paid $ 375,000 to keep quiet about the incident , The Mirror reported on Friday .	-2.4934
Hours after the claims were reported , Ronaldo , 33 returned the reports as “ fake news ” in an instagram live video to his 142 million followers .	-3.3868
No , no , no , no , no .	-1.6226

“ This is normal .	-1.3976
They want to draw attention to themselves when they say my name , but it is part of the job .	-1.8095
I am a happy man , and everything is good , ” added the player smiling .	-2.3045
Ronaldo ’ s lawyers are preparing a complaint against the magazine “ The Mirror ” ; according to Reuters , you spoke of “ inadmissible coverage of suspicions in the field of privacy . ”	-4.5936
Lawyer Christian Schertz said that the player will demand compensation for “ intangible damage equal to the seriousness of the injury , which is probably one of the most serious violations of personal rights in recent years . ”	-3.7473
The alleged incident was due to take place in June 2009 in a suite of the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas .	-3.1835
According to documents submitted to the district court of Clark County in Nevada , Ronaldo and Mayorga withdrew to the player ’ s room in a night club where he raped them anally .	-5.1209
Mayorga claims that Ronaldo had fallen on the knee after the alleged incident , saying that he was “ 99 % ” a “ good guy ” abandoned by the “ one per cent . ”	-4.4176
The documents claim that Ronaldo confirmed that the pair had sex , but it was agreed .	-1.7025
Mayorga also claims that she had gone to the police and took photos of her injuries in a hospital , but later agreed to an extrajudicial agreement because she had ' fear of retaliation ' and worried about being ' humiliated publicly ' .	-4.3422
The 34-year-old says that she is now trying to invalidate the agreement , as it is still traumatised by the supposed incident .	-3.5451
Ronaldo was on the verge of switching to Real Madrid of Manchester United at the time of the alleged attack and changed this summer with a 100 million euro deal to the Italian giant Juve .	-4.6843
Brexit : Britain would regret losing car manufacturers forever .	-1.6800
“ The United Kingdom would regret it for time to lose its position as the world ’ s leading car manufacturer after Brexit , ” said Economic Minister Greg Clark .	-3.5984
He added that it is ' worrying ' that Toyota UK announced to the BBC that they would temporarily stop production at their plant in Burnaston , near Derby , if Britain left the EU without a deal .	-3.7306
“ We need an agreement , ” said Clark .	-1.4910
Japan ’ s car manufacturer said that the impact of delays on the borders in the case of no-deal Brexit could cost jobs .	-2.7288
Last year , Burnaston , which produces Auris and Avensis brands for Toyota , produced nearly 150,000 cars , 90 % of which were exported to the rest of the European Union .	-2.8434
“ If Britain leaves the EU without an agreement at the end of March , I believe that our plant brings a stop to production , ” said Marvin Cooke , CEO of Toyota in Burnaston .	-4.6560
Other British car manufacturers have expressed fears of leaving the EU without agreement on cross-border trade modalities , including Honda , BMW and Jaguar Land Rover .	-2.7712
BMW , for example , has already announced that his work in Oxford will be closed for a month after Brexit .	-2.6659
The main concerns relate to what car manufacturers say about the risks of the supply chain in the case of ' no deal Brexit ' .	-11.4721
Toyota ’ s production facilities are based on custom-oriented manufacturing , i.e. the parts are supplied every 37 minutes by UK and EU suppliers for special products . in in in . in , in , in , , , in , , , , , ,	-14.4584
If the United Kingdom leaves the EU without an agreement on 29 March , there may be delays at the border , which , according to industry indications , can lead to supply shortages and partial shortages . .	-12.0966
It would be impossible for Toyota to keep more than one day of stock in his plant in Derbyshire , the company said , and so production would be stopped .	-3.4877
Mr Clark said that Theresa May ’ s Chequers Plan for future relations with the EU is “ precisely calibrated to avoid these controls at the border . ”	-3.2143
We must have a deal , and we want the best deal that not only enables us to succeed today , we want to seize this opportunity , ” he said to the Today of BBC Radio 4 .	-4.9717
“ The note not only of Toyota , but also of other manufacturers , is that we must absolutely be able to continue with what has become a very successful set of supply chains . ”	-4.0086
Toyota did not indicate how long the production stop could take , but warned that the rise in costs could affect the competitiveness of the plant in the long term , and that jobs could eventually be lost .	-5.5605
Peter Tsouvalaris , trade union representative and has been working in Burnaston for 24 years , said that trade union members are increasingly worried : “ My experience is that , once they are dismantled , jobs are lost forever . ”	-5.2767

Trump ’ s Rosenstein meeting could shift again , says the White House	-2.1315
Donald Trump ’ s top-class meeting with Deputy Prosecutor Rod Rosenstein could be “ postponed another week ” , as the struggle for the Supreme Court candidate Brett Kavanaugh continues , reading the White House on Sunday .	-10.2377
Rosenstein supervises the work of Special Adviser Robert Mueller , who examines the president ’ s Russian interventions in the elections , the links between Trump and Russia , and the possible obstacles to justice .	-4.1315
Whether Trump will fire or not the Deputy Public Prosecutor , and to jeopardise the independence of Müller , Washington has delivered a lot of sadness for months .	-4.5263
Earlier this month , the New York Times reported that Rosenstein had discussed the wearing of a cable to record talks with Trump , making it possible to remove the president of the 25th addition to the Constitution .	-3.3783
Rosenstein rejected an opinion .	-0.9784
But last Monday , he went to the White House , while reports haunted that he was about to resign .	-3.7440
Instead , a meeting with Trump , which was at the United Nations in New York , was announced for Thursday .	-2.2992
Trump said that he would prefer not to fire Rosenstein , but then the sitting was delayed to avoid collision with the hearing of the Senate Justice Committee , in Kavanaugh and one of the women , Dr Christine Blasey Ford , who accused him of sexual misconduct .	-3.6280
On Friday , Trump ordered a one-week FBI investigation of the claims against Kavanaugh , and continued to delay a full senate voice .	-11.3152
Donald Trump ’ s press spokesman Sarah Sanders was on Fox News on Sunday .	-1.8623
When asked about the Rosenstein meeting , she said : ' A deadline for this has not yet been set , it could be this week , I could see that I am pushing another week , given all the other things that are going on with the Supreme Court .	-5.4781
But we will see and I always keep the press up to date . '	-2.1727
Some reporters would challenge this claim : Sanders has not held a press conference in the White House since 10 September .	-2.3760
The guest Chris Wallace asked why .	-0.9482
Sanders said that the lack of briefings is not a reluctance to television reporters who behave like self-representatives , but she also said : ' I will not be against them being in the gallery ' .	-5.2559
She then proposed that direct contact between Trump and the press would increase .	-1.8480
'The President carries out more questions and answers than every president before him ' , she said and added , without evidence , ' We have looked at these figures ' .	-4.2770
Briefings will still take place , said Sanders , but the press should have the chance to ask the President of the United States the questions directly , that is infinitely better than talking to her .	-4.3912
We are trying to do a lot about this , and you have seen how we have done it in recent weeks , and it will replace a press talk when you can talk to the President of the United States himself . ”	-9.9620
Trump regularly answers questions when he leaves the White House or attends public meetings or press conferences with visiting dignitaries .	-2.4099
Press conferences with one person are rare .	-1.2889
In New York , the president may show this week why , by making a free-running and sometimes bizarre appearance before assembled reporters .	-3.8091

Scottish parliament Jane Freeman wrote her letter less than 6 months before Britain leaves the EU .	-2.6224
The Scottish Government has agreed to incorporate the costs of the agreed status applications for EU citizens working in their decentralised public service .	-2.8891
In her letter , Mrs Freeman wrote : ‘ In the course of the summer , negotiations between the United Kingdom and the EU were continued on withdrawal , heading for expected decisions in the autumn .	-14.2190

The former manager of Alloa Athletic says that he was not afraid to join the footsteps of these established managers in such a large club , before rejecting offers from Barnsley and Ipswich Town .	-4.5582
'For me , success is currently defined by the question ' Can I bring this association back to the Premier League ? '	-3.0668

“ It is not an easy task to get there , but I would probably only consider myself to be successful if I could return to the club . ”	-4.6972
Ross is only three years in his management career , after a time as co-trainer at Dumbarton and a 15-month spell for Hearts ' coaching staff .	-2.7828
He then helped Alloa recover from the relegation to the third class , and helped St. Mirren from the edge of the relegation in the following season to the master title .	-4.2564

The summer heat wave has increased revenue for the disappearing British pubs , but has increased pressure on restaurant chains .	-3.7803
Pub and bar groups experienced a 2.7 % sales plus in July - but revenue in restaurants fell 4.8 % , so the numbers .	-4.2126
Peter Martin , of the CGA consultancy , which compiled the figures , said : " Sustained sunshine and England longer than expected to take part in the World Cup led to July following a similar pattern as in June last month , when pub visits increased by 2.8 % , only that restaurants were even more affected .	-6.7428
Gastronomy falls by 1.8 % in June only worsened in July .	-3.4459

Weather and the impact of major social or sporting events remain the biggest factors when it comes to selling outside the home market .	-3.9681
It is not surprising that restaurant groups will continue to be under pressure , although a 4.8 % decline in sales over the previous year will be particularly painful alongside continuing cost pressure .	-4.3829

Milk pump advertising , where mothers are compared to cows , led to controversial online discussions .	-3.0189
A milk pump company has caused controversial online discussions due to an advertisement comparing breastfeeding mothers to melk-cows .	-5.0446
On the occasion of the launch of the allegedly " world first noiseless and portable milk pump " , the consumer tech company Elvie published an ironic advertising inspired by music videos to show what mothers are offered with this new pump .	-4.6097
Four genuine mothers dance in a haysaven in the middle of cows to a number with the following song text : ' Yes , I melk myself , but you don 't see a cock ' and ' If you did not notice that it is not euter , it is my breasts ' .	-5.5674
The slogan goes on : ' pump off , pump , I feed the babies , pump , pump , pump , I melk my ladins ' .	-4.2169
However , the ad published on the Facebook page of the company has caused controversy online .	-3.1831
With 77,000 calls and hundreds of comments , the video has received mixed reactions from viewers , many of whom say that it illuminates the " horrors " of the dairy industry .	-3.0822
" It is a very bad decision to promote cows for this product . "	-2.7384
Like us , they must become pregnant and bear in order to produce milk , except that their babies are taken away within a few days of birth , " a person wrote .	-4.2744
The Elvie Milk Pump unobtrusively fits into a Still-BH ( Elvie / Mother ) .	-3.3334
Another commented : " Understandably traumatic for mother and baby .	-1.1410
But yes , why should we not use them to promote a milk pump for mothers who can keep their babies ?	-2.7274
Someone else added : ' Such an outsider acquisition ' .	-2.5922
Others defended advertising , including a woman who confessed that she found the song “ urcomic . ”	-3.0627
I think that is a great idea .	-1.3526
I would have got one if I had stayed there .	-3.4347
By pumping off , I felt like a cow .	-3.0834
The display is a bit crazy , but I took it as what it was .	-2.8556
This is a brilliant product , " wrote a person .	-1.9693
Another commented : ' This is a funny advertisement for mothers who pump ( often at their jobs or toilets ) and feel like ' cows ' .	-2.9826
This is not an advertisement that praises or judges the dairy industry ' .	-3.1677
At the end of the video , the group of women reveals that they all danced with the decent pumps in their BHs .	-2.5694
The concept of the campaign is based on the realization that many women who pump out milk say they feel like cows .	-2.9097
However , the Elvie Pump is completely noiseless , has no wires or hoses and fits into a silent BH , which gives women the freedom to move , keep their babies and even go out in the pump .	-5.8145
Ana Balarin , Partner and ECD commented on Mother : " The Elvie pump is such a revolutionary product that has earned a bold and provocative market launch .	-3.1148
By drawing a parallel between the expression of women and dairy cows , we wanted to focus on breast pumps and all its challenges , while at the same time demonstrating in an entertaining and comparable way the incredible sense of freedom that the new pump will bring .	-4.2122

Hundreds of migrant children moved quietly into a tent camp on the Texas border .	-2.6067
The number of imprisoned children with migration background increased , though monthly crossings remained relatively unchanged , partly because the Trump administration ’ s hard rhetoric and policies made it more difficult to find sponsors for children .	-3.0982
Traditionally , most sponsors themselves have been undocumented immigrants , fearing that they risk being expelled from the country when they campaign for a child .	-3.5756
The risk increased in June , when the federal authorities announced that potential sponsors and other adult members of their households would have to fingerprint and that the data would be passed on to the immigration authorities .	-3.4982
Last week , Matthew Albence , a senior official within the Immigration and Customs Enforcement Authority , testified to the Congress that the agency had arrested dozens of people who had advertised to support unaccompanied minors .	-3.0366
The Agency later confirmed that 70 % of the detainees had no former criminal records .	-2.7380
" Almost 80 % of those who are either sponsors or household members of sponsors are illegal here in the country , and a large proportion of them are criminal outsiders .	-3.7061
" So we continue to pursue these people , " said Albence .	-2.9325
In an effort to speed up children ’ s applications , officials introduced new rules , which some of them demand to appear before court within a month of detention , rather than 60 days , which was the previous standard , according to the staff of the accommodation .	-5.9997

Those who are not eligible for discharge are quickly deported .	-3.2216
The longer children remain in prison , the more likely it is that they are anxious or depressed , which can lead to violent outbreaks or escape attempts .	-3.4325
Advocates said that these concerns are increased in a larger institution , such as Tornillo , where signs that a child has to struggle are more likely to be overlooked because of its size .	-4.2132
They added that moving children to the tent town without having enough time to prepare them emotionally or abandon friends could exacerbate a trauma that many are already struggling with .	-4.1125
Syria calls on American , French , and Turkish “ occupying forces ” to withdraw immediately .	-8.4113
Secretary of State Walid al-Moualem , before the UN General Assembly , also called on Syrian refugees to return home , even though the war in the country has been going on for eight years .	-3.3024
Moualem , who is also Deputy Prime Minister , said that foreign forces are illegal on Syrian soil under the pretext of combating terrorism , and “ we will deal with it accordingly . ”	-3.7351
“ You need to withdraw immediately , ” he said to the Assembly .	-2.5867
Moualem claimed steep and firm that the “ war on terror is almost over , ” with more than 360,000 people died in the country since 2011 , with millions more being displaced from their homes .	-4.2845
He said that Damascus will continue to fight “ this holy battle until we have liberated all Syrian territories ” from both terrorist groups and “ any illegal foreign presence forces . ”	-2.4720
The US has around 2,000 troops in Syria ; mainly educate and advise both Kurdish forces and Syrian Arabs opposed to President Bashar al-Assad .	-2.9073
France has deployed more than 1,000 soil soldiers in the war-destroyed country .	-2.4993
On the question of refugees , Moualem said that the conditions for returning are fine , and he accused of fueling “ some Western countries of irrational fears ” that encouraged refugees to stay away .	-4.3459
“ We have called on the international community and humanitarian organisations to facilitate return , ” Moualem said .	-1.8314
“ They politicize a purely humanitarian question . ”	-1.5898
The US and the European Union drew attention to the fact that there could only be reconstruction aid for Syria if there was a political agreement between Assad and the opposition over an end to war .	-13.1138
UN diplomats said that a recent agreement between Russia and Turkey on establishing a buffer zone in the last major rebel castle Idlib provides the opportunity to advance political talks .	-4.0358
The Russian-Turkish deal prevented a large-scale attack by Russian-backed Syrian troops on the province where three million people live .	-2.7471
Moualem emphasized , however , that the agreement prescribes “ clear deadlines , ” hoping that military action will be directed against jihadists , including fighters from the Nusra front associated with al-Qaeda , which will be “ eliminated . ”	-5.8475
UN envoy , Staffan de Mistura , hopes soon to convene the first meetings of a new committee of government and opposition members to draw up a post-war constitution for Syria and pave the way for elections .	-3.4151

Kavanaugh denied the allegations that he attacked Dr. sexually .	-3.9046
During his opening speech , Kavanaugh was very emotional , sometimes he shouted almost and fought with the tears when he talked about his family and his high-school years .	-3.7743
He also explicitly condemned the Democrats in committee and called the accusations against him a “ grotesque and coordinated reputation campaign , ” organised by liberals who are angry that Clinton had lost the 2016 presidential election .	-3.3574
Pelosi said that she believed Kavanaugh ’ s statement that he could not serve the Supreme Court because he showed that he was biased against democrats .	-3.6086
“ I believe that he himself disqualifies with such statements and the way he can be influenced by the Clinton and the Democrats , ” she said .	-3.9172
When she was asked whether , in the event of his confirmation and a democratic majority in the House of Representatives , she would seek an official rally against Kavanaugh , Pelosi hesitated .	-4.6334
“ I will say this : if he says neither Congress nor the FBI the truth , he is inappropriate not only for the service of the Supreme Court , but also for the service to the court in which he is currently employed , ” Pelosi explained .	-4.9723
Kavanaugh is currently a district judge in D.C. appeal court .	-2.3816
Pelosi added that she , as a democrat , was concerned about possible Kavanaugh judgments against the Affordable Care Act or Roe v. Wade because he stands for conservative justice .	-3.7165

“ It is not the time that a hysterical , prejudiced person goes to justice and expects us to say , “ Is that not wonderful , ” said Pelosi .	-4.2273

'I do not think this is unusual , do I ? '	-2.4447
She continued : “ I once helped a woman in the executive who told me that she wept when it became angry , but she developed a technique whenever she became angry and started to cry , to the person with whom she spoke , said : “ You may think that I am sad because I cry .	-11.6110
I am angry ' .	-1.0554
And then it simply continued .	-2.3828
And I thought that was brilliant . ”	-1.0974
Tears are allowed as valves for anger because they are fundamentally misunderstood .	-3.4649
One of my strongest memories of an early job in an office dominated by men , in which I once wept with indescribable anger , was that I was packed with my neck by an older woman , a noble manager before whom I was always somewhat scared - who dragged me into a staircase .	-5.6928

Because the campaign has been under way for a long time , it lagged behind funding , and so she swore that she would not participate in the race unless she collected $ 2 million .	-4.9297
It was a lost battle .	-1.0679
She noted that some of her followers , who gave $ 1,000 to men , would give it $ 250 .	-2.8889
“ Think those , I get pre-slaughter ? ” She wondered .	-4.8478
When she delivered her speech and announced that she would not launch a formal campaign , she was so overwhelmed by emotions - gratitude for the people they had supported , frustration about the system that made it so difficult to raise money and voters instead of delegates , and anger about sexism - that it was smothered .	-4.6394
“ You might think I had a nervous collapse , ” Schroeder reminds us of how the press responded to them .	-3.9262

But if Beijing uses its opportunities correctly , the trade war with the US can have a positive long-term impact on China by reducing mutual dependence on both economies , experts say .	-4.5628
