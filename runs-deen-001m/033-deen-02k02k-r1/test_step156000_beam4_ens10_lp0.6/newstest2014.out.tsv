Good : More Safety for pedestrians	-2.1551
There are no 100 metres from each other : on Tuesday , the new B 33 pedestrian lamps on the village parking lot was launched in Gutach - in sight of the older town hall sample .	-8.1260
Two plants as close to each other : intention or coup of signs ?	-5.0100
Yesterday , Gutach 's mayor answered this question clearly .	-2.6486
" The town hall sample was installed at the time because it secures the school course " , explained Eckert yesterday .	-3.5667
The Kluser-traffic lights secure both cyclists and bus passengers and the mountain inhabitants .	-3.1894
The plant officially opened yesterday is important for the intersection of Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-3.1933
We have the museum , two churches , a spa park , the bus stop , a doctor and a bank as well as the flow of transport from the residential area <unk> Grub <unk> .	-10.3639
" At the high traffic and pedestrian volume another traffic lights had to be safe " , says Eckert .	-5.5323
This is also confirmed by Peter Arnold of the Offenburg Land .	-3.0650
" According to current measurements , about 12 000 vehicles pass through the municipality of Gutach on the B 33 daily , of which about ten percent are heavy traffic " , emphasizes Arnold .	-13.0332
Therefore , building another traffic light is more than necessary : " Safety is simply going ahead " , says Arnold .	-4.5094
Four traffic looks have been carried out , a roundabout has also been considered , but because of the narrow intersection of the Sulzbachweg / Kirchstra<unk>e .	-15.4477
According to Arnold , everything was tested in the selection of traffic lights previously : " Through an extra long wooden traffic loaded for us , we have tested whether these vehicles can get out of the Sulzbachweg to the B 33 without knitting the traffic lights " .	-7.9126
The roughly EUR 15 000 traffic light plant itself is the " most modern what is currently available on the market " , explained Arnold .	-4.8007
The complex is equipped with coloured LEDs , which are so powerful that the lights are well recognized by the drivers , for example , even in deep sun .	-6.6990
And it is also economical : the older lighting systems consume about 100 watts , the new just eight watts .	-10.5889
There are three lights per direction .	-2.9784
Arnold explained the technique of the new plant : This is equipped with two radar sensors .	-2.4947
Pressing the traffic light button , the upper radar sensor tests the traffic situation .	-3.1943
If the road is free , it comes directly green for the pedestrian , if not , it takes about 15 seconds .	-3.0878
Another radar sensor checks whether the green phase for the pedestrian can be terminated .	-2.5949
" Should a group or disabled people go to the streets , the green phase will be extended , so everyone will be safely over the road " , explained Arnold .	-5.4629
Of course , the driver must be involved in thinking here as a partner and observing the railway .	-5.7302
This was not the case yesterday : barely showed the traffic light for pedestrians green , a upper class vehicle smoked through - with bright red .	-4.4358
Josef Winkler has been writing for more than 30 years his childhood and youth from the soul .	-2.8273
The catastrophes of his Catholic village childhood - the language loss , the slope of raw violence and blunt sexuality , the narrow and joylessness - have often described the Carinthian poet .	-4.3776
The winner of the book prize is known above all as a prosador , and theatre texts are rare in his work .	-5.2804
Collage from prosatexts Gerhard Fresacher composes a collage of prosatexts for his performance " Weatherlights on the tongue tip " , which is now shown in Garage X on Petersplatz .	-12.2837
The theatre maker , for example , combines elements from the autobiographically characterized novel " Der Leibeigen " ( 1987 ) with prosaminiatures from " corpse , his family bewildering " ( 2003 ) .	-4.6039
On the largely empty stage - important requirement : a crumbled sofa on which an anew is coupled and masturbated - the eight-headed ensemble is hanging through the text material .	-5.9684
Director Fresacher seems little to trust the text .	-2.8408
The 70-minute performance covers the template with an abundance of directional incidents , known from the repertoire of postdramatic playing forms .	-5.7376
Above all , the actress women come up with the sometimes somewhat questionable scenic implementations .	-5.1516
They are tough touched , floated with the head under water , with their evening drugs packed to the wall .	-5.0008
Forced in cellophane or mieder , they stacked on dangerously high stockles through staging , either monologize them loudly or are completely silent on the stage floor .	-5.3650
However , the text barely conveys itself in this strenuous way .	-3.5452
The best moments are the evening when sung - the bandwidth ranges from Deep Purple to folklore songs .	-3.9583
First towards the end the rotated performance becomes a little calm , and Winkler ’ s absurd humor flashes .	-6.9124
A car blackbox ?	-1.3481
American road planners are looking for a source of money to repair the falling Highway system , and believe to have found the solution in a small black box that can be found in each car ’ s armature board .	-5.4637
The equipment recording every kilometre driven and reporting the information to the authorities is at the heart of a controversial attempt by Washington and federal planning offices to revise the obsolete system for financing US roads .	-4.4207
The usually boring road planning area has suddenly created an intensive debate with colourful alliances .	-3.1231
Libertarians have associated with environmental groups and are in favour of the government using the small boxes to record the kilometres – and perhaps even where they have been driven – and then using the information to calculate tax modest .	-5.5954
The Tea Party is horrified .	-1.1593
The American Civil Rights Association ( ACLU ) is also deeply concerned and raises a number of concerns about data protection .	-2.6781
But , while Congress cannot agree on action , several states are no longer waiting .	-2.5939
They are currently examining how they can switch over the next ten years to a system where drivers pay per mile .	-4.1256
Thousands of drivers have already tested tachographs , some of which are equipped with GPS monitoring .	-2.1049
That really is a must for our country .	-1.9699
“ It ’ s nothing we can only use , ” said Hasan Ikhrata , Managing Director of Southern California Assn. of Governments , who plans to record miles for all California drivers in the federal state from 2025 onwards .	-4.5165
The way we pay these taxes will change .	-1.4563
The technology is there .	-0.9180
The initiative comes at a time when the Highway Trust Fund , financed from taxes that pay US Americans at the tap , is defaulting .	-3.7846
But in America , there is no longer as much tank as before .	-4.4670
Cars use less petrol .	-1.5687
The government tax of 18.4 cents per Gallone ( less than 4 Eurocents per litre ) has not increased for 20 years .	-3.0398
Politicians do not dare to raise the tax just by raising one cent , at high peak prices . . the is . . .	-10.2506
“ The petrol tax is simply not sustainable , ” says Lee Munnich , an expert on transport legislation at the University of Minnesota .	-3.1847
His state recently equipped 500 cars with tachographs to test a millen-based payment system .	-2.7722
“ This is the most meaningful alternative in the long term , ” he said . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.5154
Bureaucrats call it a millen-based user fee .	-1.9373
It is not surprising that the idea appeals to urban liberals , because the tax could be used , for example , to influence driving behaviour in such a way that congestion and climate-damaging exhaust emissions are reduced .	-4.6658
The California planners are focusing on the system for drawing up strategies to achieve the federal state ’ s ambitious legal objectives on climate change .	-4.6687
But the Republican Bill Shuster from Pennsylvania , Chairman of the House Transportation Committee , also declared that he sees the most viable long-term alternative .	-2.9910
The free marketers of the Reason Foundation are also intended to pay drivers after their journey . .	-4.7321
“ This is not a tax that disappears in a black hole , ” says Adrian Moore , Vice-President for Reason guidelines .	-2.3960
People pay directly for what they get .	-1.1345
The movement is also supported by two former American Transport Ministers who , in a report in 2011 , called on Congress to move toward millen-based accounts .	-3.6936
Last year , the US Senate approved a $ 90 million pilot project comprising 10,000 cars .	-2.2890
But the majority in the House of Representatives prevented the movement and responded to the concerns expressed by MEPs from rural areas who often represent many miles in the daily route to work or to the city .	-12.9863
Nonetheless , several states and major cities are moving in that direction .	-3.5066
Oregon is the most dedicated driver , who currently advertises 5,000 drivers for the country ’ s biggest experiment .	-10.7047
These drivers will soon pay the mile charges to the federal state rather than the petroleum tax .	-3.4014
Nevada has already completed a pilot project .	-0.9413
New York City is also considering one .	-2.0679
Illinois tests it to a limited extent with trucks .	-2.1297
And the I-95 coalition , which includes the Transport Ministries of 17 states on the east coast ( including Maryland , Pennsylvania , Virginia and Florida ) , is currently examining how to introduce the amendment . . in . , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.2386
The concept is not a universal hit .	-0.9567
In Nevada , where 50 volunteers were recently equipped with the devices , drivers were sceptical about the idea that the government could pursue any of its movements .	-3.2640
“ Concerns about Big Brother and such things were a big problem , ” explains Alauddin Khan , Head of Strategy and Return Management at the Transport Ministry in Nevada .	-3.4084
People did not want it .	-0.9690
When the test started , the ACLU of Nevada warned on its website : “ It would be relatively easy to transform tachographs into adult monitoring devices . ”	-3.4707
There is no need to build a giant , bulky technological infrastructure that would inevitably be used to collect data on the daily movements of individuals .	-3.3812
Nevada belongs to a number of states that are now looking for affordable technology , with which the state can capture kilometres driven , but not when and where .	-4.3360
That , Khan said , would also reassure the public .	-2.5797
Hunting for this technology has led some authorities to a small startup company called True Mileage in California .	-2.0110
The company did not originally start to help states tax drivers .	-3.4906
Rather , it was their goal to gain foothold in an emerging car insurance market , where drivers should pay on the basis of the miles driven .	-5.4255
But the devices it tests are also interesting for road planners , because they do not work with GPS and provide only limited information that is regularly uploaded by modem .	-4.0224
“ People are more willing to participate if their speed and locations are not recorded , ” said Ryan Morrison , Managing Director of True Mileage .	-2.9231
Great mistakes have been made in some of these public pilot programs .	-1.8548
There are much cheaper and less intrusive ways of doing this .	-1.8957
In Oregon , the planners experiment with giving car drivers a range of choices .	-2.8582
You can choose a device with or without GPS .	-1.4361
Or they choose no device at all and instead pay a flat rate based on the average miles driven by all the inhabitants of the federal state .	-12.4860
Other places hope to be able to sell the concept of a suspicious public by equipping the equipment with more functions than with few .	-11.3074
In New York City , traffic officials want to develop a tax device to pay parking fees , pay only for driven kilometres , and collect speed data from other vehicles in real time thanks to which drivers can avoid traffic .	-5.2759
“ Drivers would be motivated to participate by the added value of the benefits offered by the system , ” says it in a city planning document .	-3.9483
However , some traffic planners are wondering whether the whole talk about paying per mile is not just a huge diversion . .	-14.4259
At the Metropolitan Transportation Commission for the territory of San Francisco Bay , officials said that Congress could easily solve the problem of bankrupt Highway Trust Fund by raising fuel tax .	-3.4774
An additional one-off fee or an annual levy could be imposed on drivers with hybrid vehicles or other vehicles that use little fuel , so that they too pay a fair share .	-4.3340
“ There is no reason for an operation if an aspirin is sufficient , ” explains Randy Rentschler , the head of the Commission ’ s legislation and public affairs .	-9.0001
If we do that , hundreds of millions of drivers are worried about their privacy and many other things .	-2.5374
King Field : Small team beats wacker .	-2.6122
Voluntary fire brigade handled their autumn test despite shortages of staff with bravour .	-4.3060
Only 11 man took part in the exercise .	-7.8159
Commander Hans Kammerer had chosen the property in the Burgberger Strasse in his exercise .	-3.4489
A short circuit should have been created when sawing .	-4.3725
Two people were injured by the emerging fire and smoking development , but one of them could send an emergency call .	-3.2985
Two respirators of the Wehr were prepared to enter the building after the first review of the facts by Hans Kammerer .	-4.1709
After a short time , the first person was found and guided to the outdoor .	-5.0474
The second person had to be borne .	-1.3092
This was not so easy as a narrow staircase was overcome .	-4.6787
The building , a workshop with an integrated stable for two horses , was not easy to secure .	-2.2292
It stored plenty of wood and even straw balls in it .	-3.6794
Furthermore , electrical machines were used for wood processing .	-3.5427
The first extinguishing attack was carried out via the tank in the vehicle .	-2.5746
A further line was carried out via a flood hydrant at about 100 metres away .	-5.1687
Now three extinguishing attacks have been designed .	-3.0711
A hollow beam pipe was also used in the building .	-2.7090
Hans Kammerer ’ s exercise was also about showing what is to be done with poorly available staff .	-5.3267
In the event of an emergency , support will be provided via the Königsfeld daily operations group .	-4.7989
The commander was satisfied with the exercise .	-1.9361
Networking of universities and firms is important to us . in .	-11.2398
During his visit to the district of Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald , Landday President Guido Wolf also found out in Titisee-Neustadt about where the workforce of tomorrow came from .	-5.3789
In the Hochschwarzwald Förderzentrum he , together with the managing schoolmanagers of the professional schools , as well as the Kreisgymnasium and the parental learning chairmen , raised this important question .	-6.8460
" Education is an important location factor " , emphasized Claudia Stehle , director of the Hans-Thoma School , which presented the networked school project Education Centre High-Black Forest .	-4.5515
Wolf was impressed by the model projects for education .	-2.5152
Since 2011 , there has been successful cooperation between the Förderzentrum , Kreisgymnasium and Vocational School Centre in .	-4.2599
He also praised the family friendliness of the district . .	-8.6480
" It is important not only to have a family phase in mind , but also , because of demographic change , the phase of care for relatives , " explained Wolf .	-4.4151
He also pointed out that more and more employees were concerned about caring for and caring for their relatives .	-4.1912
" Without the support of employers , the resulting burden on employees can lead to an end to the working relationship , " said Wolf .	-3.4925
But no one can afford to lose skilled workers , he said .	-2.1756
Another important factor is the networking of universities and companies .	-2.6262
" For anyone who has learnt about the benefits of the region during his studies often , with his acquired knowledge and skills , retains the regional economy , which contributes to the strengthening of the region , " the Landday President has shown himself to be convinced .	-7.5206
The fact is that only if sufficient training places are offered can skilled workers be met .	-4.5578
In his opinion , the location advantage of the district is its favourable location in the south-west of Germany , close to France and Switzerland .	-4.2469
Moreover , on his railway journey from Titisee-Neustadt to Freiburg , he experienced the efforts already made to expand public passenger transport .	-13.0833
" Stay stubbornly and ensure that public transport is improved , " he told the local politicians present .	-4.2726
Music is an entertaining afternoon .	-2.3956
The Kaul family has been inviting the Dietinger seniors to coffee , cake and afterwards to a vesper for 15 years .	-4.3441
In the past , the elderly were caught in the restaurant .	-3.0355
This afternoon is taking place in the care secret of St. Josef .	-3.5378
The residents look forward to delicious cakes and cakes .	-2.4555
There was later a sausage .	-2.0335
Silvia Kimmich-Bantle and her father Karl Kimmich entertained with standard melodies .	-2.9124
The 100-year-old natural stone wall as the front distinction of the old school courtyard to the Church Road is to be re-established with the refurbishment cost plan of the city of Bräunlingen .	-7.0537
In the days before the Kilbig , a small corner wall , stabilization and static discharge of over a hundred years old natural stone wall with Balustrade was built in the first works of restoration of the front school courtyard .	-6.2418
The next step is to include Alexander Misok from the Bräunlinger Stadtbauoffice , the National Monument Office in the planning stages and to create a rehabilitation concept for the old wall .	-6.6695
The intention is to calculate costs by experts , who will then be put on the table to the Council of Communities to decide and determine further action .	-6.1701
A decision on this will probably be taken next year .	-2.6044
After the rehabilitation , plastering and tree planting of the old school court within the two side wings of the school built in 1912 , it is necessary to be rebuilt and rebuilt as a follow-up measure .	-17.2172
The historical , one-hundred years old wall of the old school farm to the church road , is mainly due to water and frost damage , since there is no drainage , needing to renovate and has an archery tendency forward .	-7.0929
Deep cracks in individual stones testify to weather damage , but the wall is not currently in danger of collapse .	-3.6752
A sturdy wall is a prerequisite for a school courtyard used by pupils , which has been carried out by the current fortification work .	-5.3348
Originally , school court renovation was even planned in 2008 / 2009 , but high unplanned expenditure postponed it .	-4.5836
An important word in the historical recovery of school walls , which has even been used for film recordings , will be shared by the National Monument . in the of .	-16.6207
Should guidelines come from this site , the city of Bräunlingen hopes for grants from the monument guards .	-4.1469
The students of the Bräunlinger Principal School , who are now re-educated in a well-renovated old school building with new aula , can soon use the old school courtyard .	-5.8490
<unk>zdemir wants to receive jazz education in Stuttgart .	-2.1272
Cem <unk>zdemir , Federal Chairman of the Greens , has now taken part in the ongoing discussions on the future of the music colleges in Baden-Württemberg .	-3.6997
" I think it is wrong to abandon holistic training at the Musikhochschule Stuttgart , " said <unk>zdemir the " Stuttgart News " .	-3.3509
Jazz and classical music belong to the Stuttgart jazz site .	-3.4677
This contradicts the Green Red Government , which is considered a favorite for a direct mandate at the German election on 22 September .	-5.3886
On the basis of an expert study , it pushes forward a reorganisation of the five music universities in Baden-Württemberg .	-4.1917
Then , among other things , the course of study is to be transferred from Stuttgart ’ s Musikhochschule Stuttgart to the Musikhochschule MannheSchule .	-5.4764
US Border : Super Tunnel Discovered to Drug Trafficking	-3.9475
On the border between Mexico and the US , investigators discovered and decommissioned a ' super tunnel ' for drug smuggling .	-2.8481
As the US customs authorities pointed out , the more than 500 metre-long tube between Tijuana and San Diego was equipped with electricity , railways , and ventilation .	-3.5797
Three suspects were arrested , eight tonnes of Marijuana and almost 150 kilograms of cocaine seized .	-2.6261
The tunnel , according to the statements , was not yet used .	-3.6261
" These cartels are stupid if they think they could dig under the radar , " the US District ’ s General Prosecutor , Southern California , Laura Duffy , said at a press conference in front of a San Diego warehouse , where the tunnel had been discovered .	-4.6891
" If you continue to build such tunnels and try to use them , we are determined to make a huge waste of your dirty money " .	-4.2394
Both the US authorities and Mexican security forces are in permanent struggle against the drug cartels .	-2.5818
Since 2006 , more than 77 000 people have been killed in Mexico in connection with drug crime .	-2.0749
Constructed by experts	-0.7231
Because of the extensive equipment of the tunnel , the investigators assume that it was constructed by architects and engineers and that the was in . the was in in the was . in , was in . was in	-13.5631
The track was equipped to use electrically operated cars .	-3.4235
On the Mexican side , access is in a building that is 80 metres from the border .	-2.6885
According to the authorities , a ladder leads to the depth of 20 metres to the the tunnel . in .	-12.0804
The tunnel has a cross-section of 1.20 meters altitude and 90 centimeters width .	-2.4340
It would also have been appropriate to promote illegal immigration towards the United States .	-3.1804
Two of the suspects were arrested in connection with the cocaine fund .	-2.0265
The third , a Mexican , was captured because of the seized marihuana .	-2.8645
All three threaten the maximum penalty for lifelong freedom withdrawal , as officials have said .	-3.4767
Since 2006 , eight such tunnels have been discovered , and the San Diego press conference continued .	-2.5804
It is the first time that cocaine was found in such a tunnel construction .	-2.7046
Normally cocaine is smuggled in smaller quantities , not through tunnels .	-2.3801
This shows the ' despair ' of drug gangs whose traditional routes are now cut off , Bill Sherman said of the DEA drug search in San Diego .	-3.9284
They would do everything to get to the US .	-2.0977
No details have been given to the detainees , at least one being Mexican , that was said .	-4.5009
They are expected to face up to ten years in prison .	-3.2982
In 2014 , Geisinger Festjahr	-2.1682
The anniversary of the city of Geisingen on the occasion of the 1250 .	-1.7880
Return to the first instructional mention is getting closer .	-3.8903
When the anniversary is over eight weeks after the end of the year .	-3.6255
Geisingen and church houses were first mentioned together in 794 .	-4.1716
A certificate was produced in churches where both places are mentioned .	-3.0740
On 15 March there will be an official start to the anniversary year , and since Geisingen currently has no hall , this opening event will take place in the place where both of them were mentioned for the first time 1250 years ago , in church houses .	-6.0196
In the anniversary , a number of events are planned in Geisingen , as well as in church houses .	-4.7896
In July at a festival weekend from 18 to 20 July the 1250 will be held .	-4.7234
Return to celebrate .	-1.5054
On Friday with a festival , on Saturday and Sunday with a festival around the church hall .	-2.7642
This festival also includes the Church Hausen Church Festival .	-3.9970
City Music Director Rudolf Barth wrote an order composition for the city on the occasion of the anniversary , which is listed at three events .	-4.3296
On 21 June together with the Sunwend Celebration of the Black Forest Association , on 12 July in the arena with fireworks and on 13 December as the first concert of city music in the new Festhalle .	-4.5406
This will be finished and inaugurated in the anniversary year , the official appointment is on the last September weekend , 27 and 28 September .	-3.7639
On the occasion of the Geissinger city anniversary a new chronicle will be issued .	-4.4590
" But it should be a chronic not only of hostages themselves , but a printed work about today 's hostages , which consists of hostages , church homes , layoffs , aulfingen and good madings , " said Mayor Walter Hengstler .	-6.0711
And the Geisingen of today celebrates 2014 birthday , in 1974 today 's space was completed with the communities .	-4.9018
The new chronic will be presented on 21 or 22 November at the new Festhalle in Geisingen .	-3.1282
Otherwise , 2014 is a year with many anniversaries .	-2.8372
The Narrenzuft Strohglonki begins on 8 February with a custom sailing on the occasion of its 60th anniversary , the Harmonie Gutmadingen will be 90 years and will celebrate the Festbanquet on 29 March and then celebrate the district music festival from 1 to 4 May .	-5.7555
The Altenwerk Leipferdingen is 40 years old , the Geisinger School has been at the new site for 50 years and celebrates this on May 10 , the Polyhymnia Leipferdingen music association will be 150 years old and celebrates this in the context of the Well Festival from July 4th to 7th .	-5.5663
The city of Geisingen was first mentioned in 764 in a donation certificate owned by the monastery of St. Gallen .	-3.3085
The certificate was produced in churches ( houses ) , which was then a court place .	-4.3613
Both municipalities are therefore mentioned in the same document .	-2.2336
In 2014 , this 1250 year old celebrated accordingly , in addition , the community reform is 40 years old .	-12.3071
Council targets track systems	-2.0602
Should the train transfer " Am Hirschen " be converted to improve road safety ?	-4.3271
Yes , the municipal councils have agreed . in . , , , , , , , ,	-8.2349
Shieltach must hold EUR 220 000 for this .	-2.9472
Deutsche Bahn wants to improve the Kingtal railway line next year .	-2.8367
The aim of this is to increase safety at rail transitions - regularly collisions of trains with other vehicles throughout Germany .	-4.9392
If the municipalities agree to the restructuring measures , they must participate with one third , the rest share the railway and the federal government .	-5.5532
Shiltachs city building master Roland Greeholder explained to the council the peculiarities of the railway transition " Am Hirschen " .	-5.3965
There , the city plans to build a book in the amount of the tunnel there west of the railway track .	-4.8863
There , too , larger vehicles , such as those carrying long wood , could stand for counter-traffic without blocking the track .	-5.5448
Greekers therefore proposed to construct a necessary supporting wall in such a way that , in due course , the city could spread the street afterwards to ensure a smooth flow of traffic .	-14.9413
This was discussed controversially in the local council because some councils doubted the need for road proliferation : Thomas Kipp , in his remarks , put the mood of the critics to the point : ' Do we have to pay so much money because of so few vehicles ? '	-6.1282
Mayor Thomas Haas contradicted : The " Hirschen " railway transfer is regularly used for long wood transport .	-3.8622
Even wood from the Kuhbach area is partly transported over this route because the vehicles of up to 20 metres could not use the route at the Häberlesbrücke because they could not turn into the main road .	-5.6405
In addition , the route serves as a redirection for those vehicles that cannot use the tunnel when the main road is closed , argued Haas .	-3.1273
It should be foreseen that Kirchberg and Schlossbergtunnel would have to be rebuilt and renovated , as is the case at the moment in Wolfach , the railway transfer " Am " Hirschen " could also be an important means of transport for a longer period of time .	-7.0599
The councils agreed to have the cost of broadening the road .	-4.2892
Notwithstanding this , the majority of the railway transition was agreed with the provision that the necessary support wall should be built in such a way that the city could expand the subsequent road towards " Bahnhofstra<unk>e " to meet traffic at around 5.5 meters .	-7.6592
By contrast , the transition of the railway to Gerrei Trautwein could cause a very different problem , affecting access to the highly rising ' golden houses ' route .	-6.9822
The administration had investigated the railway reconstruction plans from the Breinlinger engineer 's office , as it had doubts as to whether the planned connection of the Geroltzhäuser Weg would be perfectly possible .	-6.3602
The investigation concluded that the road ’ s tendency could lead to longer vehicles sitting .	-4.9870
The responsibility for this again lies with the city as a road construction loader .	-5.0478
The renovation could therefore lead to liability disputes .	-4.2301
Because both the wooden departure and the turning off functioned in the current state of expansion , you should not agree to the rebuilding of the railway transition , Haas argued .	-6.1941
Also , at this point , the risk of collision of the train with a vehicle on the transition is significantly lower than at the other train transitions , because directly next to the center , to which there is a good visibility connection .	-7.1849
Even trains from the main train station should be stopped at this point so far that no collision threatens .	-12.8784
The majority of the people refused to convert this transition , since the city of Schiltach would have to " tackle " the problem with sitting vehicles , as the railways could withdraw from responsibility after the construction work has been completed .	-8.5478
As an unproblematic point , the body considers the conversion to the railway transitions " Before Heubach " and " Before Kuhbach " , for which arrangements have already been made with the railway .	-5.9953
Esa decides on major space emissions : Missions for billions of euros	-2.8294
Far planets , gravitational waves or black holes - experts from the European Space Agency must now agree on two major projects that they want to start over the next few years .	-9.8930
30 proposals were available , five are still in the race .	-2.5596
Far worlds .	-0.7665
More than 1000 planets at other stars have already found astronomers .	-2.0562
No one knows whether there are lives , at least on some of them .	-3.5727
The choice is difficult : should you search for gravitational waves ?	-3.6780
Or rather explore the origin of cosmos ?	-2.2641
Or are you looking for similar planets , and thus perhaps discoverlife ?	-5.7930
These are the questions that the European Space Agency Esa is responsible for .	-3.2485
For their Cosmic Vision program , they are looking for ideas for two major space projects that are intended to make significant progress in research .	-4.1889
The budget for such ' L missions ' is around EUR 1 billion each .	-2.5979
The start is expected to be 2028 and 2034 .	-1.6538
Earlier in September , the elite of European space research met in Paris to discuss proposals for such missions .	-8.9112
30 ideas were debated , five of them have now come to the closer election .	-3.7859
Numerous bodies examined the proposals , took a look at them .	-10.6699
A final decision will be taken by the scientific committee in the next few days .	-3.0423
In total , four major questions have been chosen by the Esa , to which the missions of the Cosmic Vision program initiated in 2007 are to be found .	-5.0209
What are the conditions for the emergence of planets and lives ?	-1.9318
The exact processes involved in the emergence of stars from large gas clouds - and thus also the emergence of planets circulating these stars - are still in proverbial darkness .	-4.8184
A big infrared elescope in all could penetrate this dark .	-3.4523
And if a star planet possesses under what circumstances can life emerge there ?	-10.6364
In 2017 , the ' Cheops ' space telescope is to launch this issue , which will examine more closely 500 already known planet systems in our surroundings .	-6.7183
However , the possibilities are limited , cheops are a small mission with a budget of EUR 150 million .	-2.5746
With larger instruments , astronomers could illustrate similar planets and even analyse the composition of their atmospheres , searching for " biomarkers " : gases that are considered an indication of biological activity .	-4.3766
How does the solar system work ?	-0.9778
This issue , too , is supposed to provide an insight into the conditions for the emergence of life .	-5.2901
The magnetic activity of a star plays an important role , as well as the interaction of its magnetic field and the particle radiation from it with the planet system .	-4.2998
In our solar system these processes can be examined in an exemplary manner .	-3.5127
With the Solar Orbiter , Esa has already approved a M class mission ( there is a budget of about half a billion euros ) for this issue .	-4.0644
The probe will start in 2017 and watch closely the surface and activity of the sun .	-3.3759
Jupiter and his moons are of great interest to the researchers .	-7.6641
They want to find out what role the Giant Planet played in the development of the solar system .	-2.7805
For this , the Esa provides the first of the three L-missions of the Cosmic Vision programme .	-12.2049
The song " Juice " ( Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer ) is expected to begin its journey in 2022 .	-3.1101
Eight years later , she reaches Jupiter and is supposed to examine the atmosphere of the planet , as well as the icy moon Europe , Kallisto and Ganymed .	-8.1666
What are the basic physical laws of the universe ?	-1.0094
Welltal offers many opportunities to study matter under extreme conditions and to examine whether the laws of nature we know are still valid there .	-5.9383
Perhaps there are also deviations that could give physicists the way to a new theory under which all known laws of nature can be united .	-4.7202
How did the universe emerge and what is it like ?	-2.8012
13.7 billion years ago , our cosmos were created by the big bang .	-3.7929
Besides the frequent material that consists of stars , planets and living beings as we do , there is dark matter whose gravity holds galaxies and galaxy clusters together , and dark energy , which accelerates the expansion of space .	-5.8596
So far , researchers do not know which physical laws were valid in the first seconds of the Big Bang , nor do they know what dark matter and dark energy are .	-4.5006
With " Euclid " , the Esa has already approved a M mission , which is scheduled to start in 2020 .	-4.2325
With a special telescope , the probe is intended to examine the distribution of the matter in the universe for the first time throughout the sky , thus enabling conclusions on the nature of Dark Material and Dark Energy .	-6.4693
Who could make the race	-1.9725
Of the 30 proposals , only two will remain left at the end of the selection process .	-1.8598
In the opinion of many experts , " E-Lisa " , the best chances of granting L-Mission is an ambitious concept for detecting gravitational waves .	-4.9188
These physicists understand changes in the structure of space that Albert Einstein predicted almost 100 years ago .	-3.2544
They have still not been proved .	-2.1469
Elisa could do that , the scientists hope behind the project .	-3.1739
The mission provides for a detector composed of two or three probes , which is stationed in all .	-3.8334
Unlike plants on Earth , it could also prove waves of gravity that emerged from the Big Bang , thus providing new insights into the emergence of cosmos .	-6.3344
Four more suggestions are competing for the second L-mission : a big X-ray telescope called Athena , which , among other things , is to explore black holes , " Icy Planets " , another mission to the outer planets of the solar system , " Prism " , a mission to measure cosmic background radiation , and the " Exoplanet Finder " , which will detect and examine similar planets .	-6.2135
Amongst other things , suggestions on sample return transport from Mars , the research of moon , venus and asteroids , and sunlight physics have already been made .	-6.8828
Snowden is ready to “ cooperate ” with Germany on US surveillance .	-1.9512
Edward Snowden , the Whistleblower of the US Secret Service , has stated that he is willing to travel to Berlin and tell the German Bundestag if the American National Security Agency and its director Keith Alexander do not give answers to their activities .	-4.2955
German MEP Hans-Christian Ströbele met Snowden on Thursday in Russia , where this asylum was received to discuss with him the statement in Germany .	-3.4662
In a letter by Snowden , which was presented to the media in Berlin on Friday of Ströbele , it writes : “ Even though the result of my efforts has been proven positive , my government continues to treat differing opinion as a loyalty , trying to criminalise political expression with a threat of criminalisation , in which no defense is possible . ”	-6.8898
But telling the truth is not a crime .	-1.3615
In the letter , Snowden writes that he is convinced that the support of the international community can persuade the American Government to drop the charge against him .	-3.3513
The charge made by the US Department of Justice includes spying and theft of state property .	-3.0624
German Home Secretary Hans-Peter Friedrich said online over time : “ If Mr Snowden is prepared to speak with German representatives , then we find ways to make that possible . ”	-9.8076
Relations between the US and Germany are burdened by the claims that the NSA has heard Chancellor Angela Merkel ’ s mobile phone .	-2.9693
Thomas Opermann , the MEP who heads the parliamentary committee responsible for the secret service , said that you should seize the opportunity to listen to snowden as witnesses , if this is possible , “ without jeopardising it and completely ruining relations with the US . ”	-5.4261
Ströbele , a member of the Greens , published a picture of himself and snowden in his Twitter feed .	-9.3328
He was accompanied by two German journalists during his visit to Russia .	-1.2691
Ströbele explained that , according to former NSA staff ’ s lawyer , Snowden cannot return to Russia if he leaves the country .	-3.6309
If Snowden states in Germany , he will need an assurance that he is “ safe ” there , the honourable Member says .	-3.5812
In his letter , Snowden declared that he was subjected to a “ serious and ongoing ” campaign of persecution that had displaced him from his homeland .	-4.6825
But it is touched on the global response to “ my act of political opinion . ”	-2.6003
Citizens around the world , as well as senior politicians – including in the United States – have described revelations about an uncontrolled system of extensive surveillance as a merit to the general public .	-3.8933
In his letter , Snowden gives the German authorities an offer of cooperation “ when the difficulties surrounding the humanitarian situation have been resolved . ”	-2.9761
Frontier Airlines charges for hand baggage charges . payin of . of . payin of of . in . , , ,	-13.0057
Frontier Airlines plans to demand up to $ 100 of passengers who wish to stop baggage on their flight .	-3.5135
Frontier Airlines intends to calculate up to $ 100 for a piece of hand baggage and $ 2 for coffee or limonade , even though it was read in the announcement on Wednesday that passengers should keep all doses .	-4.2248
The new fee applies to hand baggage in the baggage compartment above the seat , small bags under the seat are still free .	-3.4664
Frontier explained that you will charge USD 25 if the fee is paid in advance , and USD 100 for travellers who paid only at the flight .	-5.3898
Frontier Kate O 'Malley said that the fee of $ 100 is intended to move travellers to pay in advance .	-3.6167
“ We do not want to calculate this amount , ” she explained .	-2.3525
In 2008 airlines began to charge for the first and second piece of baggage .	-3.5179
Passengers who tried to circumvent them have thus stopped as much as possible into hand baggage , which means that the baggage compartments are often overcrowded over the seat .	-11.7458
Fees are one way to get passengers to take on board less .	-2.7002
O 'Malley said that the new fee is not really about earning money .	-1.7659
It is about the most faithful customers of Frontier , who would have made it clear that it is becoming increasingly difficult to find space above the seat .	-4.3801
Passengers who buy their tickets on the airline website do not have to pay .	-2.5104
This means that a passenger may be allowed to carry a piece of baggage free of charge at the climbing of Frontier , but the next person will have to pay $ 100 for a comparable piece of baggage .	-4.2446
O 'Malley explained that the site of Frontier and the check-in procedures would be changed so that passengers were informed of the fee before they arrived at the descent .	-4.5529
Frontier ’ s new hand baggage charge will not come into force until summer , but there is no exact date yet .	-4.5379
Passengers often fly over baggage surcharges and other charges , but airlines are happy to use them .	-3.8861
They argue that the transport of baggage should cost money and that passengers should pay this service if . . .	-11.0748
Many on Wall Street see the new baggage charges as a sign that airlines are taking enough money to cover the costs of air travel after years of loss .	-3.4640
However , most people have so far fingered hand baggage charges .	-4.3214
Spirit Airlines Inc. demanded three years ago as the first hand luggage fee and later Allegiant Air , also a low-cost aircraft .	-4.5627
The only other airline with such a fee is the Hungarian Wizz Air , the airline consultant Jay Sorensen , who closely follows the additional charges .	-3.8698
He estimated in a December 2011 report that the hand baggage charge for Spirit would reach USD 50 million per year .	-3.9312
Sorensen , who previously held a leading position at Midwest Airlines , has recently flown with Spirit and was curious about what he would expect at the climb if passengers were faced with the company ’ s unusual hand baggage fee .	-5.6926
“ The boarding process was one of the most smooth I experienced in my aviation career , ” he said .	-2.8038
I expected to see teeth cherries and handful discussions at the climbing . .	-11.4194
“ The plane was full , ” he said , “ and the boarding ran as lubricated . ”	-1.9212
Frontier also follows the 2 dollars required for coffee , tea , limonade or juice .	-2.8855
The company explained that passengers who buy limonade or juice should retain the entire dose and that coffee will be refilled for free .	-5.0772
Water remains free .	-1.6322
In 2008 , US Airways attempted to demand money for refreshing drinks , but reverted seven months later , after complaining to passengers and no other large company had retreated .	-5.6791
Frontiers ’ step of charging handbaggage if passengers do not buy directly from the airline is the latest initiative to guide customers to their own website .	-4.5439
Airlines pay online travel agencies such as Orbitz 10 to 25 USD per ticket sold .	-2.3465
This gives all companies an incentive to move passengers for direct purchases with them instead of an online travel agency .	-4.0561
Frontier , however , has gone most closely in this area .	-2.7125
In September , the company began to assign only half as many frequent flyer miles when booking through an online travel agency .	-3.4735
On Wednesday , the miles were cut again to 25 % of the route .	-2.3450
For this reason , a flight travel booked by a third party with Frontier over 1000 miles brings only 250 miles in to customers .	-12.3765
Passengers may also reserve seats only for direct purchases on the Frontier site .	-4.0547
Frontier has a loyal customer base at its headquarters in Denver , but the business shrinks and the company loses money .	-2.8273
Revenue fell by 9 % , and flight capacity shrunk by just under 13 % in the first quarter , as can be read in the financial report published on Wednesday by the parent company , Republic Airways Holdings Inc .	-4.4705
Republic has tried to get the finances of Frontier under the sale of society .	-3.3364
Talk from the Bible	-1.7508
A good 40 women visited the last women ’ s breakfast this year in the evangelical parish of Bisingen .	-3.3570
The theme of the day in the municipal house was " sayings from the Bible " and " speeches from the Middle Ages " .	-3.3136
Zita Köhler , the chairman of the parish council , entered the Biblical proverbs after breakfast .	-3.6532
" Sayings contain wisdom , rules or warnings , " she explained .	-2.9801
It compared several saying words with the corresponding Bible places and explained the meaning .	-3.3185
She called saying words like : wooden eyes are vigilant , as scales fall from the eyes , throw an eye on someone who gives the Lord in sleep , wash his hands in innocence .	-4.5845
On several occasions , the speaker also advised her audience what the saying was .	-5.4059
The speeches from the Middle Ages took on the church councillor Christel Dehner : All good things are three , blue , ha.	-5.1298
She explained the importance and origin of the speeches she called ' bridges to the past ' .	-2.3229
Finally , a raffle was lost .	-2.3146
The prizes were covered on a table and were humorously described before they were handed over to the winners .	-3.0755
Among the visitors of the breakfast round , the mayor candidate Roman Waizenegger also mixed .	-3.7888
Learning instead of unemployment : pilot project for unskilled tourism	-2.2207
At the Mecklenburg Lake Plate , a pilot project for the tourism industry began .	-3.4498
Under the leadership of the Federal Employment Agency , 49 women and men who are already working as unskilled people in the industry will be qualified over three winters to professionals for hotels and restaurants .	-4.9984
" New is that the six-month courses end with qualifications , " said Carmen Wiechert of the Neubrandenburg Working Agency .	-4.0658
The benefits are diverse : participants would not be unemployed , firms would receive trained professionals , who are increasingly lacking in hotels and restaurants , and the agency would not have to finance unemployment .	-13.1857
The Chamber of Commerce in Neubrandenburg and the Deutsche Hotel- und Gaststättenverband ( Dehoga ) Mecklenburg-Vorpommern are also involved in the project .	-3.3441
NSA declares that an “ internal error ” and not hackers are to blame on the crash of the site ’ s website .	-3.7104
The shadow National Security Agency declared late Friday that an error had paralyzed its public website for a few hours , not hackers , as was claimed online .	-5.1372
“ NSA.gov was not available for several hours this night because an internal error occurred during a planned update , ” the spy agency explained in an e-mail message .	-4.1892
The problem will be resolved this evening .	-1.5359
The claim that the failure was caused by a distributed Denial of Service Attack ( DDoS ) is not .	-2.2516
In the early evening , online server trackers noticed that the NSA website was not available for at least six hours , and that for some users it is still not .	-4.9100
Previously , a NSA spokesman told ABC News that the Authority ’ s sensitive internal network was “ in no way ” compromised .	-3.5006
Secret information is not in danger , so the speaker .	-2.1215
At least one group of hacktivists claimed to have paralyzed the NSA website with a DDoS attack .	-2.6263
In such attacks , the target website is flooded with page calls until the servers are overloaded and the site collapses .	-3.5244
Cybertactics are relatively simple and attacks do not serve to penetrate the internal network of the target system .	-2.6503
The former super-secret NSA , whose nickname was no search agency ( no such authority ) , is now in the bright light of the public , and is seeing the revelations of its extensive domestic and foreign surveillance program – a result of the secret NSA data stolen and published by the disillusioned former NSA staff , Edward Snowden .	-13.8018
The growing controversy over the intelligence service fueled initial speculation that the incident today is the result of a targeted cyperoperation .	-4.0389
The number of people without a job in October fell by 22 to 1.307 .	-3.1613
Although the 3.1 % quota is better than last year and also better than in September , " we would have hoped for more , " says Monika Felder-Bauer , Deputy Manager of the Agency for Employment in Sonthofen .	-4.6492
Because many farms have reacted to date to attitudes .	-4.5385
One reason for this is , according to Felder-Bauer : ' We have hardly any skilled workers in the craft , in health care and in the care of the elderly ' .	-5.1589
Since September , season offers for personnel in the hotel and restaurant industries are also available .	-6.3581
The winter season starts in mid-December .	-2.0164

Bombardier profit after decrease in delivery numbers and orders	-3.2890
The Canadian aircraft and railway manufacturer Bombardier Inc reported a 15-percent fall in net profit on Thursday , having been under pressure from declining orders and deliveries on third quarter aircraft and contractual problems in the railway sector .	-5.3188
Bombardier , headquartered in Montreal , also did not publish flight test data for his brand new CSeries aircraft and did not provide any new information on whether the aircraft could go to commercial use in accordance with the ambitious schedule next September .	-4.7102
The Jungfernflight of the test aircraft one and a half months ago has so far only three further launches , which makes it questionable whether the test phase is going as planned .	-5.8855
The results fallen short of the forecasts and caused a shortfall of over eight percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange .	-4.4248
On Thursday , Cameron Doersen , Analyst at National Bank Financial , lowered his evaluation from “ outperform ” to “ sector perform ” with a view to ensuring that the share has a limited price potential in the next one to two quarters .	-4.0790
“ Although most aircraft were expected to deliver weaker numbers , we are clearly disappointed by margin development in the transport sector , ” said Doerksen in a customer letter .	-5.2798
We believe that Bombardier will receive new orders for CSeries when the aircraft test program progresses .	-3.3178
However , if no new orders are announced in the coming months , we expect the market to become more sceptical towards the programme .	-3.3072
Bombardier hopes that CSeries aircraft will be able to catapult the company into the lower market segment currently dominated by Boeing and Airbus .	-3.1181
The first test aircraft was presented to the public in March and flew for the first time in September after months of delays .	-2.7002
But binding orders for CSeries with 177 are moderate , as potential buyers wait for the results of the flight tests and want to see if the company ’ s claims are true in terms of fuel efficiency and cost savings in the new jet aircraft .	-4.8849
Currently there are 403 orders and commitments from 15 customers and companies .	-1.9390
Managing Chairman Pierre Beaudoin is confident that Bombardier will reach his target of 300 binding orders at the beginning of commercial use of jet .	-3.4642
The company ’ s management also assured analysts and media on Thursday that the program was on schedule .	-12.6013
“ The test aircraft was no longer on the ground than expected , ” Beaudoin said at a telephone conference and added that during the aircraft ’ s standing time , ground tests and software updates had been planned .	-4.5972
Each manufacturer plans differently .	-1.3671
We have decided to make a first flight and then to annex a revision period , as we have done .	-3.3833
This is happening throughout the flight programme .	-1.8921
The second of five test aircraft is expected to be launched in the next few weeks , the rest of them soon afterwards , said it from the business side .	-5.3262
Nevertheless , analysts remain sceptical as to whether twelve months after the juvenile flight the first customer can use an aircraft of the CSeries .	-4.9102
Bombardier explained that it reviewed the planning for commissioning ( EIS ) and will update it in the coming months .	-10.0471
“ The slow progress of the flight test – even though it appears that it corresponds to Bombardier ’ s internal planning – reinforces our view that commissioning will shift to the first quarter of 2015 , ” said Doerksen .	-4.8423
In the third quarter , at the end of 30 September , Bombardier ’ s net profit fell to $ 147 million , or $ 8 cents per share of $ 172 million , or $ 9 per share a year earlier .	-3.3762
Adjusted earnings per share is 9 cents .	-2.9296
Sales declined slightly , down from $ 4.2 billion to $ 4.1 billion .	-2.1880
Analysts had expected a profit of 10 cents per share and a turnover of $ 4.56 billion , says Thomson Reuters I / B / E / S.	-3.0395
The world ’ s fourth largest aircraft manufacturer indicates that it has delivered 45 aircraft in this quarter , a decline of 57 last year .	-2.8329
Net stations fell from 83 aircraft to 26 .	-2.1467
The order book in the aerospace section was $ 32.9 billion on 30 September , unchanged from 31 December .	-3.7682
“ In the field of aerospace , the results were within the framework of our targets , but low order intake and overall market conditions were disappointing , ” said Beaudoin .	-4.1999
Sales in the aerospace industry fell by 13 % to $ 2 billion .	-1.9675
Bombardier , the world ’ s largest railway manufacturer , announced that sales in this section have increased by barely 11 % to $ 2.1 billion . in 200in the in in . in , , , , , , and , , , , , ,	-14.7345
The order book in the transport section was $ 32.6 billion on 30 September , slightly increased compared to 31 December .	-3.1960
The transportation profit margin was affected by settlement problems in some major contracts .	-3.3004
According to company management , there will be new targets for the fourth quarter .	-2.8283
In the afternoon ’ s trade on Thursday , the bombardier share declined by 8.5 % , with 4.83 Canadian dollars , having also been announced that the Google Finance Board will change Patrick Pichette to the board .	-5.1340
The Brazilian Embraer SA , the world ’ s third largest commercial aircraft manufacturer and bombardier of the closest rival , announced on Thursday a ten-percent decline in quarterly profit . in . in , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.4012

Cocaine-dependent lawyer who warned drug bosses against police investigation must be in prison .	-3.6837
Basharat Ditta , 42 , gave information to Neil Scarborough Underworld Size further .	-2.8581
The lawyer was afraid that his secret drug addiction could come to light .	-1.7208
He was sentenced to three years in prison by the Liverpool Crown Court .	-2.2124
A well-known defender who warned a drug baron about a major police investigation because he was afraid that his secret drug addiction could be detected was sentenced to three years in prison .	-3.3377
Basharat Ditta , 42 , supplied subworld size Neil Scarborough with sensitive information about his activities in the drug trafficking after compromising his own cocaine addiction .	-4.1684
The criminalist “ first-class ” lawyer with the nickname “ Bash ” was arrested in his house in 2011 , after the Scarborough police supervised , who he represented in an earlier drug process .	-4.8847
Officials observed how Scarborough ( 32 ) delivered three bags cocaine at the house of the lawyer in Blackburn , Lancashire , while he was with colleagues at a meal of the bar .	-4.2550
The investigation revealed that Ditta regularly consumed class A drugs after traces of cocaine were found in his hair , wallet , and credit cards .	-4.0931
Over a period of eight months between January and August 2011 , he tried to obtain unauthorized information on the arrest of two men on behalf of Scarborough and one of its partners .	-3.0423
All four suspects were supervised by the police during a major investigation into the heroin and cocaine trade in Lancashire , Cumbria , Merseyside , Berkshire and West Yorkshire .	-3.0040
Together with 32 others , they were arrested later after the police secured heroin and cocaine worth <unk> 1.5 million in household searches and <unk> 200,000 in cash .	-4.9792
Ditta , 42 , gave information to the criminals because he feared his dependence on drugs could become public .	-2.5764
Today , Ditta , who works for Forbes Solicitors in Blackburn , was found guilty and sentenced to Liverpooler Crown Court after a three-week trial in two charges for obstructing the judiciary .	-4.8184
He gave the cocaine ownership during an earlier survey .	-3.0383
The lawyer was converted after the police found out in their investigations against Scarborough that he had been in regular telephone contact with Ditta in February 2011 .	-3.5469
Two investigative officers followed the suspect and saw how he went to Ditta ’ s house , placing drugs under the rubbish tonne of the lawyer with a purity of 60 % in a black glove .	-13.6107
Shortly after delivering the drugs , Scarborough regularly telephoned Ditta at the football stadium of Blackburn Rovers in Ewood Park .	-3.1639
The lawyer returned home , the drugs returned , and then nine communications were exchanged between the two .	-3.3567
Ditta was known to be a “ regular consumer ” of cocaine after testing drugs in class A in his hair , wallet , and credit cards had been discovered .	-15.7144
Ditta was arrested later , disputed to take cocaine and said he spoke to the alleged dealer because he was his client and claimed that her discussion was subject to the “ secret of lawyers ” .	-4.8860
During his arrest , Ditta took his wallet and tried to remove a number of credit cards , but they were ensured and a hair test was taken from him .	-3.0760
In the police interrogation , he stated that he would make an office and clients at home , both under his private address and at work .	-4.7966
It was announced before the Court that he had appealed and informed important drug traffickers , some of whom he represented earlier , after significant arrests .	-5.8396
Public Prosecutor Anne Whyte said : “ A criminal prosecutor should know better than anyone else that the law is not broken . . ” . , , , , , , , , , is , , , , , , , is , , , ,	-13.6159
Ditta is accused of abusing his position as a criminal defender because he has become too much involved with certain clients .	-4.0195
The relationship in question is not simply a drug trafficker , but a drug trafficker who supplies his lawyer with drugs .	-3.1844
Part of his communications was undoubtedly legitimate , because he was the lawyer of these people .	-3.1767
But that went far beyond the limits of a normal relationship between lawyer and client .	-2.3732
He opposed police investigations as far as possible , so that they could continue to investigate their criminal activities .	-3.5378
Mr Ditta thus disreputed his profession .	-2.7831
He was too close to certain clients , especially Scarborough , and he allowed his independence to be compromised .	-2.0935
Ditta referred to every misconduct by saying , “ If I were a corrupt lawyer , which I did not want to pass on information to Scarborough , I would not wait 15 hours , but would do it immediately . ”	-5.2788
But , after the hearing , Superintendent Lee Halstead said from the Lancashire police : “ Mr Ditta did the move from a criminal defender to a criminal at the moment he began to acquire drugs from organized criminals . ”	-3.9429
His cocaine dependence led to a hopeless compromise and made him receptive to the motives of leading members of organised crime , who asked him to obtain valuable information on police investigations .	-3.9587
Lawyers must maintain the highest standards of integrity and ensure confidence and confidence in the public .	-1.9780
Ditta has lost this trust and tried to hide behind the facade of his profession .	-3.1793
The Serious and Organised Crime Unit of Lancashire led the investigations against Ditta , which also led to a conviction in three cases for the possession of cocaine and judicial handicap , which underlines our determination to bring criminals to justice .	-4.7906
This case should be a warning to criminals and shows that none of them can escape the arm of the .	-3.1073
We will find you and bring you to court .	-2.4517
Scarborough himself was sentenced to 14 years in prison , after guilty of conspiracy for heroin , cocaine and cannabis trading .	-3.3318
Thirty-five more people involved in drug trafficking have been sentenced to total sentences of 153 years for drug offences .	-4.0481
Ditta published an area of questions and answers on his website , indicating that his dream job was to represent clients in the death cell in America , his ultimate guest at dinner was Mohammed Ali and inequality of opportunity .	-4.7419
Revolutionary work of church music	-1.2432
At the end of the celebrations on the occasion of its 160th anniversary , the liederkranz Dunningen will frame two services with the " Deutsche Messe " by Franz Schubert .	-4.7601
After the great success of the musical " Rock my Life " , which enthusiastically enthusiastically attracted spectators in the spring of this year , the song crane will enrich two services at the end of the anniversary year with the performance of the Deutsche Messe by Franz Schubert .	-5.8155
On Saturday , October 26 , this extraordinary exhibition will be held from 19 : 00 during the evening fair in the St. Martinuskirche Dunningen and on Sunday 27 October , at 10 : 15 p.m. at the Service in St. Johannes Baptist Church in Lackendorf .	-5.9096
The so-called Deutsche Messe with the original title " Songs to celebrate the holy sacrifice of the Messe " , D 872 , is a spiritual music of the composer Franz Schubert from 1826 and was almost revolutionary at the time of its origin .	-5.4723
The exhibition is performed in the context of the services of God , as the client Johann Philipp Neumann had in mind .	-4.8228
Under the direction of Hermann Schneider , the choir is accompanied by the brass group of the Musikverein Frohsinn Tennenbronn and Noemi Lokodi on the organ. , , in , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.9974
Haslach : Skepsis Grows of Confidence	-3.1460
For example , the 2015 parish council elections will change fundamentally in the Haslach Seelsorgeheit ( SE ) unit .	-10.5196
There is then only one common parish council for all six parishes .	-2.3510
In a joint session on Saturday , the bodies of Haslach , Hofstetten , Mühlenbach , Fischerbach , Steinach and Welshenstein prepared for the changes .	-3.7217
The fact is that the basic decisions of the diocese are no longer to be changed and it is up to the parish councils to implement them as satisfactorily as possible .	-5.1958
During the day , it became particularly clear : skepticism towards the new is hesitant but increasingly giving way to confidence .	-5.2768
From the ideas and expectations of the innovations in 2015 to concrete proposals on the future composition and size of the parish council , the extremely constructive discussions of the six bodies with the main officials of the Seelsorge Team went on .	-9.4880
Georg Schmitt , a regional decan , explained the new guidelines for seafood units in the Archdiocese Freiburg .	-4.0565
After that , the SE Haslach , as a church community , will form a public law body that enters into the rights and obligations of the six separate church communities to date .	-5.8673
There will only be a common parish council and a foundation board representing the parish power .	-10.7300
At least two elected members are to be represented from each parish ; in the six parishes so-called community teams are formed on the ground .	-4.2807
Their task will be to promote church life in the place in the future .	-3.0041
On the question of the finances of the individual parish community , there was a considerable need for discussion .	-4.8609
The innovations provide that accumulated credits will be kept in the parishes for the purpose .	-8.0009
Liabilities , on the other hand , go over to the general community .	-3.3716
There was great concern , particularly with regard to the major planned investments , the commitment of which was then made by all parishes .	-5.6528
" Even in the past , only investments were made in projects managed by the individual parishes alone , " relativised Haslach 's parish Chairman Bruno Prinzbach .	-4.6436
Practical experience with a joint panel for five parishes described Barbar Knitter , the Chairman of the Board at the Seelsorgehenitz Unit Schutterwald Neuried . . in in in . in , , , , , , , , ,	-11.8457
In 2006 , they had set themselves the task of ' becoming one , staying five ' and found that this is not so easy .	-5.7152
The bodies of the Haslacher Seelsorgeunity then decided to answer the questions about the future composition and size of the common parish council and the practical work of the community teams .	-4.4601
The drafts will be specified in further meetings and adopted at another joint meeting of all six bodies next spring .	-4.4678
In the end , Michael Schöner from Steinach presented the new logo of the Seelsorgehenitschaft unit , which was approved by a clear majority .	-3.8472
In Pfullendorf , electricity is becoming more expensive .	-2.7812
The citizens of Pfullendorf must adapt to higher electricity costs .	-3.6503
As confirmed by the Managing Director of the city plants , Jörg-Arne Bias , against the S<unk>DKURIER , a four-headed Pfullendorfer Family 70 to 90 euro additional costs per year are added .	-6.2312
The main reason for the upcoming price increase is the increase in the so-called EEC transfer from 5.277 to 6.3 cents per kilowatt-hour .	-2.8603
Each October , the four operators of the large electricity transports will re-establish this system .	-7.1540
These amount to the additional costs incurred by the energy transition , which they can impose through the price of electricity .	-6.1849
The towns of Pfullendorf form the last link in this chain .	-3.2398
In its forecasts , the Supervisory Board of the Energy Company had even assumed a higher levy , as Jörg-Arne Bias reported .	-3.8593
Now , the concrete payments would have to be calculated before the city plants could inform their customers about the exact price increase next week .	-17.0857
" We are going to raise 1 cent plus x , " says Bias , with the number more close to the 2 cents .	-4.3743
Traffic light on permanent rot : Wait for waiting .	-11.8688
Sometimes a traffic light simply doesn 't get green .	-2.7608
The contact loop in the street does not react , or the light sign is defective .	-2.9630
What should be done - to drive red ?	-3.7286
If an affected person has waited long enough at a red traffic light and the crossing is free , he can continue , explains the Stuttgart lawyer Ralf Becker in the magazine " Motorcycle " .	-4.3012
However , waiting time must be ' appropriate ' , which could be interpreted differently from case to case .	-3.3979
Becker advises to stop at least five minutes before any disruption of the traffic lights occur.	-16.5762
However , anyone who continues the journey despite the red light should be aware that he is fully responsible for an accident caused by it .	-5.0857
If you tolerate less than five minutes , you may not wait long enough , Becker warns and refers to a decision by the Hamm Court .	-3.7875
In the negotiated case , a driver had ignored the traffic lights after about three minutes and had to answer for a negligent breach of red light .	-3.9883
The traffic lights were not defective , but jumped on green a little later .	-4.9137
He was spared a driving ban because of the particular situation , but the fine was not .	-4.5251
The Council is pleased with sound budget	-3.2881
Whenever the household meetings are concerned , mayor Ralph Gerster laughs well .	-3.9217
The municipal bag in Herdwangen-Schönach is well filled and debt has not known the administration since 2005 .	-3.2347
In this sense , the 2012 financial year can also be booked as a full success .	-2.9880
This became clear when the annual accounts were presented for 2012 .	-2.1699
As Andrea Rothmund explained , the administrative budget of around EUR 7.6 million was higher than planned .	-2.8034
The surplus of the administrative budget was also around EUR 1.8 million above the approach .	-3.0713
The surplus is mainly due to higher commercial tax revenues and the share of income taxes .	-4.6621
Asset budgets were also well above planned values .	-2.9318
Instead of the EUR 1.5 million envisaged , it was EUR 2.5 million last year .	-1.9092
" This is largely due to the higher supply from the administrative budget , " says Rothmund .	-4.1465
Since fewer investments were made in the 2012 financial year than planned , the repayment supply has also been higher .	-4.4481
Overall , the overall reserve has been increased by around EUR 2.1 million to a total of EUR 4.9 million now .	-2.9919
Mayor Ralph Gerster thanked Rothmund and her team for their good work .	-1.7126
" One work doesn 't just shake out of the sleeve " , praised Gerster with a view to the annual accounts .	-4.3612
He and the municipal councils were delighted at the good numbers .	-3.0248
It may sound paradoxical , but it is precisely these good figures that citizens could soon be expensive .	-3.2493
The good financial situation has enabled the municipality to abandon high levels in the past .	-4.8692
However , according to Gerster , this has often reduced grants from the country .	-4.7400
These grants from various levels of compensation are required .	-3.0387
Amongst other things , the cities and municipalities that apply for grants must provide certain levels .	-4.6272
" We need to look at the issue of lifting rates , because in the years to come there are investments for which we would like to have grants , " Gerster announced in this context .	-5.2655
Nagold : Hugo Wermter in Chor for 60 years .	-2.2432
With 60 years as a singer , Hubert Wermter ’ s history at the Männergesangverein Cäcilia is almost twice as long as that of the autumn festival in which he was solemnly honored .	-4.4246
Hubert Wermter stood on stage as usual in the colors of his singing club .	-3.1847
After 60 years he still enjoys singing with the choir that is probably more than loving .	-6.1557
In the association , Wermter was also active , including for 28 years as a member of the committee .	-2.8109
He received several awards for his commitment and association : Jörg Kohr , pastoral speaker on behalf of the Cäcilienverband Rottenburg-Stuttgart , presented him - since the choir is also a church choir - a certificate of the association and an honorary letter signed by Bishop Gebhard Prince .	-4.9045
His singer colleagues presented him with the certificate of the German Choral Association and a serious tinteller .	-4.9046
Besides the honor , the 31st Autumn Festival in the normal railways was loaded with the MGV Betra , the song sick salt stetten , the Baisingen singer department and the local music association , the Vollmaringer had a colourful mix of different choirs and singing styles that entertained the 400 visitors .	-8.1569
The MGV Fullmaringen opened with atmospheric songs such as " In Wine Paradise " and " Lustig , their brothers " .	-3.6823
Her honorary singer Hubert Wermter prepared her for honor a small stand - Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's " Bundeslied " .	-3.5215
The Männergesangverein Betra also sang classical choir songs such as " Hunter Promotions " by Julius Wengert , " Weit , weg " from Hubert Goisern and the folk song " When you go through the valley " .	-4.7460
The song crane Salzstetten , with its mixed choir and female group - the " impulsor " - ensured the female quota of the festival .	-5.8633
The mixed choir abducted with the Neapolitan folklore " Santa Lucia " and " Eviva Espana " from Antos Gus to foreign countries , while the " Impulschor " also resorted to foreign languages : " Liberatio " and " Hey Jews " belonged to her programme .	-5.0386
The singer department of the Baisinger Sportverein came back to home with " What 's the Swob ? " by Hans Süssmuth and Robert Paperts " Bierlied " , where the Fullmaringer Musikverein completed the crowning musical degree .	-6.1535
For the children there was a small annual program - " Oma Hanne " alias Hannelore Stollsteimer introduced a Kaspers theatre and read a few stories that the children were busy at lunch .	-6.1455

Kenya ’ s press outrages about controversial media law	-2.2411
‘ We are in a frightening situation , and one might wonder : what does Parliament think of abolishing judicial independence tomorrow ? ’ was read in the newspaper that considers the draft legislation to be unconstitutional .	-5.8460
“ The law is draconian and very punitive and we reject it , ” said Cyrus Kamau , Capital Group Managing Director , including CapitalFM , one of Kenya ’ s most prestigious independent radio stations and news websites .	-9.9272
He said that the new media tribunal “ will always be prejudiced , because it is an extended arm of government , ” and restrictions on content and advertising would damage Kenya ’ s position in the global economy .	-2.9320
“ I hope the President listens to us and we appeal to him to reject this draft legislation and send it back to Parliament , ” he said .	-2.8357
According to the newspaper The Star , the government , through the new law , “ effectively assumes a stranglehold on the media , ” whereas The Standard , Democracy , and Freedom of speech in Kenya , writes “ a heavy blow , ” and called the draft “ draconian . ”	-6.3834
The adoption of the law is a series of measures aimed at strengthening national security in the aftermath of the attacks by armed Islamists on the Westgate Shopping Centre in September .	-10.4641
The Kenyan media raised the wrath of the authorities because they published recordings of security cameras on which the units posted on the site allegedly exploited the luxurious shopping centre .	-5.5976
Police Chairman David Kimaiyo reacted to interrogate with the appointment of two journalists and a leading media representative , even though the submission was withdrawn after the outcry of the media .	-4.3891
According to the new law , media houses can be punished with up to 20 million Kenyan shillings , and individual journalists with up to one million , as well as the further risk of losing their professional recognition or being excluded from official press accreditation .	-4.1068
The Tribunal also has the right to confiscate the possession of those affected if a punishment is not paid .	-3.0004
According to Daily Nation , “ one penalty can push most radio stations into bankruptcy . ”	-9.1225
Moreover , the newspaper believes that these measures could have a devastating effect on Kenya ’ s description of “ lively blogosphere . ”	-2.5920
If they silenced the media , politicians could do whatever they want .	-2.1550
“ No one will ever know , ” Mutuma Mathiu , journalist wrote to the nation , who calls Kenyan media a a crucial control factor in public life .	-3.9602
“ Leaving politicians to themselves , they bring the country into bankruptcy and us back to the time of hunters and collectors , ” he commented .	-3.3733
Kenyan legislators have already raised public anger in the past .	-3.1892

Six years ago , thoughts came about creating an artificial sports centre , which was generally considered the ultimate solution .	-4.4648
Concrete plans were introduced two years ago , when the FC took over the inheritance hall , pledged a cost share of EUR 100 000 for the construction of the place and approved a funding of EUR 104 000 .	-6.0743

Much of the speaker transition is thus falling away - the noise level is intended to be reduced so significant.	-6.9056
Creating a more relaxed atmosphere is the goal of this innovation .	-2.5894
As Airport spokesman Peter Kleemann announced to Radio Vienna , Vienna Airport follows an international trend in stopping transmissions affecting individuals .	-4.3783
The airports in Copenhagen , Frankfurt or Dubai , among others , have already renounced the noisy calls .	-3.8732

In case of visiting the café of the same name at the oplace in the district of Kleve , visible to the Rhine-Waal University , it does not have to stay at the pure Déjà Vu feeling .	-6.5602
After all , the café with its beautiful name is aimed precisely at making an actual stay not only thoughtful but always repeatable .	-6.1054
Because it 's just fun and simply beautiful .	-2.5654

UN announces new poverty reduction targets	-1.7486
The United Nations is now beginning to develop a series of new objectives to replace the twelve years ago Millennium Development Goals for the fight against poverty .	-3.6293
In the run-up to the UN Sustainable Development Summit , which began in Rio de Janeiro in the evening , Australian diplomats played a key role in pushing for “ sustainable development goals ” to replace the Millennium Goals expired in 2015 .	-3.2184
They were included in the final draft document adopted by global leaders , including Mrs Gillard , at the summit .	-2.5491
UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon said at the summit that the time had come to “ think beyond national interests . ”	-3.2348
“ I am pleased that the Member States have agreed to pursue a process aimed at agreeing universal , sustainable development goals , ” he said .	-3.2462
“ These objectives will build on our progress from the Millennium Development Goals and will form an integral part of the post-2015 development framework .	-2.3956
I will spare no effort to implement this mandate given to me by the Member States in order to achieve our vision of the sustainable development objectives built on the success of the Millennium Goals . ”	-3.4155

" After all , I don 't know how a victory tastes , " Malmon expects a success experience from his team at the VfL Fredenbeck II .	-4.1165
Although the Third League Reserve from Fredenbeck has not run out trees at the moment , Malmon has warned the finger in advance .	-14.3029
Many players have trained me in the A-Youth .	-10.5879
Therefore they will certainly be particularly motivated against their ex-coach .	-2.7828
" Moreover , it is important to wait for the first time to be amplified , " the SG-Coach illustrates .	-5.8375
To finally return to the track of success , the Malmon team must certainly increase compared to previous performances .	-3.6839
Above all in the cover work and in the switching game it was very huge .	-5.9532
We must definitely improve recycling of opportunities .	-3.0684
So I hope that my players will finally get their head free during the short break .	-3.6266
Security concerns in Mozambique are growing in the face of clashes between influential personalities .	-2.1936
Thousands of people gathered in the centre of Maputo under the watchful eyes of the statue of Samora Machel , the founder of Mozambique and the first president to join peace in a rare public demonstration .	-4.6558
“ We want peace again , we want stability , ” said Vanessa de Sousa , Managing Director of an investment company .	-1.8328
From fear for the future of the country , she has exchanged her business clothing for a t-shirt with the title “ We Desk Security ” in Portuguese and joined the crowd on Thursday in the Capital ’ s Independence Square .	-5.8891
For two weeks now , there have been almost daily reports of clashes between government forces and Renamo , among the worst wars since the peace agreement over 20 years ago .	-3.7280
Renamo was once a notorious rebel movement , initially supported by White Rhodesia and later the apartment government of South Africa , in an effort to destabilize the country ’ s independent government .	-3.9080
Following the 1992 peace treaty , it became an opposition party .	-1.8706
Analysts find it unlikely that the country will return to a balanced conflict , but recent events have worried foreign investors and locals .	-3.0317
Much is at stake for the rapidly growing economy , because the discovery of huge gas deposits off the coast and coal camps in the north-west could bring in investment of more than $ 50 billion of firms such as Rio Tinto , Vale from Brazil , Eni from Italy and Anadarko from the US in the coming years .	-5.7723
The ruling Frelimo Party , since 1975 the dominant force , and Renamo blame each other for tensions .	-2.4322
Renamo claims that the government provoked recent clashes by attacking its members in the province of Sofala , a traditional Highburg of Renamo on 17 October .	-3.1347
The attacks on the former rebels escalated when government forces attacked Renamo bases and tried to kill Afonso Dhlakama , group leader , explained Renamo ’ s spokesman against the Financial Times .	-3.2075
The government blames Renamo for the clashes and accuses the organization of attacking soldiers .	-2.2713
President Armando Guebuza has tried to raise concerns about instability .	-1.3760
Contrary to AFP , the French news agency , he said on Wednesday that Dhlakama considers itself a “ loser , ” who “ wants to use all his remaining forces to prove that he can impose his decisions on the government . ”	-4.3452
Both Frelimo and Renamo stress that they want to avoid war .	-1.9259
But the concerns have increased since Mazanga was quoted in the words , Renamo giving up the 1992 peace agreement .	-3.5109
In comparison with the FT , he said that Frelimo no longer respects the agreement .	-3.9304
“ Our vision is to reopen negotiations and to begin seriously , ” said Mazanga .	-8.1747
Previous talks between the parties have done little to resolve the tensions fueled by a number of collisions this year .	-2.6078
“ Here we have two adult men ( Guebuza and Dhlakama ) who meet the heads , ” says Joseph Hanlon , teacher at Open University and Mozambique expert .	-3.7523
None of them are well negotiated and nobody is prepared to make the necessary concessions .	-2.1884
Renamo , pushing for electoral reform , has already stated that it will boycott the local elections in November .	-2.9576
The presidential and parliamentary elections are planned for next year .	-2.2242
Some commentators have interpreted the use of force as an attempt to obtain concessions and financial benefits from the government .	-3.3261
Renamo ’ s election success has been shrinking since 1992 , while a newer party , the former Renamo member Movimento Democrático de Mo<unk>ambique ( MDM ) , is likely to improve in the elections .	-3.2428
Mazanga claims that Guebuza – whose resignation will be when his second term ends next year – wants to destroy the country ’ s democracy .	-2.6916
“ He does not want multi-party democracy , he does not want transparent elections , he does not want peace because he does not want to give up the presidency , ” says Mazanga .	-2.4783
It is unclear what capacity Renamo has , but it has undertaken unrestrained attacks on police stations and vehicles on important north-south links .	-4.0842
Most of the fighting took place in Sofala province , which is a few hundred kilometres north of Maputo , where Beira is located , the port , the mining companies such as Rio Tinto and Vale are using coal exports .	-5.2165
In June , Rio suspended rail use for one month after Renamo announced an attack on the track .	-3.1960
Mazanga replied cautiously to the question of whether Renamo will repeat this threat .	-8.2836
Renamo wanted to “ warn the international community that things are not good in Mozambique , ” said Mazanga .	-1.8111
Instability has increased frustration over the government , says Fernando Lima , head of Mediacoop , an independent media company , because many people have already worried about corruption , slow progress in development and a recent wave of abduction .	-3.7026
“ People think that the government and the president are responsible for the country ’ s future , and he should be the one who finds solutions to the problems , ” he explains .	-2.7963
Omar Sultane , a demonstrator , said that people simply wanted stability .	-1.2640
“ No one is interested in Renamo and Frelimo , they simply want peace and usable streets , ” he explained .	-3.5610
Children should be taught myths and legends as “ models of life ” , says an author .	-2.7356
Thor ’ s stories showed that “ brutal force has no chance against clever tricks , ” and the Artus legend demonstrate how important it is to have a dream .	-2.8356
Many of the myths , however , are “ far too wild , too offensive , and in some cases too dirty to be taught in schools , ” why Crossley Holland called for “ careful selection ” of ancient works .	-3.7290
“ I find it wonderful that in America myths and folklore are already part of education , ” he said .	-1.9776
I have been proposing this as a plan for 20 years .	-1.9870
He added that , among authors and teachers who are “ excessively didactic , ” children would “ shut off completely , ” because in entertaining stories , the messages would be “ subliminal . ”	-4.9605
Crossley-Holland , who translated Beowulf from Anglo-Saxon , and author of the Penguin Book of Norse Myth and the British Folk Tales , said : “ You can pursue certain intentions , but you should keep them in the background . ”	-3.7819
Perhaps the biggest difference between an adult writer for adults and an author who writes for children lies in the need to give hope .	-3.2852
Not everything must be simplified or lead to the Happy End , but there is an immanent sense of good and evil .	-2.7274
It must be depicted understandably , revealed by history and not explained .	-4.2758
This is the old story of showing rather than telling .	-2.5479
Hansyakob is once again dragging to Freihof	-9.6801

Stilecht brought him to Mühlenbach with Erich Becherer 's two-later and " Black Forests Foxen " .	-5.4835
He was not only welcomed by the audience with a lot of applause , but his sister Philippine also welcomed him .	-2.9913
Billy Sum-Hermann understood it incredibly good to get into the role of the sister and gave her enormous lives in mimimic and gesture .	-4.6918
Between the individual game scenes , the Mühlenbach farm band played selected music pieces in a matching way and thus completed the performance .	-5.7676
Haslach ’ s mayor Heinz Winkler gave the honour to the award of the Civil War , who , along with a part of the city council , gave his honour to the award of the Civil War .	-8.3874
Their expectation then made the triking- singers who prompted Hansyakob to call : " Oh how beautiful , youth memories of my own triking-time will be alive again " .	-7.1910
With their song " O Jesulein " they enjoyed the audience in the Freihof as well as the stork day children with their loud " Heraus , Heraus " .	-5.1145
His criticism of the Official Church was the same as his concerns about agricultural excesses , the consequences of industrialization or the effects of war .	-4.2056
In the homeland , behind his tomb on the fire at Hofstetten , he found his resting place .	-3.9590
" A troubled spirit had finally found its peace and had gone back forever " , it was said at the end of the scene game .	-4.7206
Many applause and many praisewords were given by the audience for performance .	-3.8233

Nevertheless , the first breathing was not to be heard from Ludwigsburg .	-4.0755
" We did not deal with the Wildcard procedure unless it is clear that Düsseldorf is not licensed , " said Neckar-Giant Boss Alexander Reil of our newspaper .	-4.4378
Until May 23 , Basket ’ s auctioneer Düsseldorf can still submit documents to the Arbitration Court and prove his economic suitability .	-14.2572
So far , the license has been refused twice .	-2.7939

They distribute the coal coming from the vessels to the hald .	-8.9812

Court of Justice is blocking the NYPD Stop-and-Frisk Directive	-2.8899
A federal appeal court in the USA blocked the order of a judge calling for changes to the Stop-and-Frisk Programme ( “ Stop and Search ” ) of the New York Police Department on Thursday , and deposited the judge from the case .	-4.8603
The Second US Appeal Court declared that judge Shira Scheindlin ’ s decisions would be suspended until the city ’ s appeal was decided .	-4.6771
The judge judged in August that the city contravened the Constitution with the way in which the program for personnel staying and consulting was implemented .	-4.9759
The city appealed against its assessment and the remedies imposed , including the decision to set up a monitoring centre to help the police amend their directive and the relevant training programme .	-5.1337
The Court of Appeals heard the arguments on Tuesday on the suspension . .	-3.8153
The appeal report declared that the judge should be removed from the case , because it violated the code of conduct for US judges by determining that a judge should avoid the appearance of partiality ; this was partly justified by a series of media interviews and public statements in which she publicly reacted to the criticism of the court .	-12.1175
The judge had judged that police officers violated the civil rights of tens of thousands of people because they targeted black and Latin American men with the Stop-and-Frisk programme inappropriately .	-3.4882
It appointed an external body for monitoring the implementation of major changes , including reform of directives , training and service supervision , and arranged a pilot program with cameras supported by the body in quarters in which most controls were carried out . the in .	-11.7195

Oral negotiations on the appointment of the city are planned after 14 March 2014 .	-3.0851
The stop-and-fresh tactic has been criticised by a number of civil rights defenders .	-2.8083
Such controls have existed in various forms for decades , but the number of recorded controls rose during the parliamentary mayor Michael Bloomberg ’ s term of office to an all-time high of 684,330 in 2011 , most of them black and Latin American men .	-4.0159
In 2004 , four men belonging to all minorities submitted a complaint that became a collective redress .	-3.3378
Advocates of changes to the NYPD ’ s Stop-and-Frisk Programme say that changes will end unfair practices , create a more trusted and effective police force , and influence the way in which other police presidencies use the regulation .	-4.5197
Opponents believe that the changes would dampen the morality of the police , but not crime ; money would also be wasted and the wider problem of a police force that has been under pressure after thousands of jobs have been abolished in the last decade .	-5.7709
The judge pointed out that she did not end the stop-and-fresh practice that is constitutional , but only reform the way the NYPD implements the controls .	-4.1086

Coulson used telephone hacking to check a tip .	-2.1812
The former news of the Word editor Andy Coulson supposedly used “ telephone hacking , surveillance , and confrontation ” to confirm a false tip about a affair of the then Home Secretary Charles Clarke .	-4.7143
Andrew Edis QC declared the court in the Old Bailey , News of the World in May 2005 a false rumor that Clarke had a relationship with his “ attractive special adviser ” Hannah Pawlby .	-3.6172
The newspaper commissioned the private detective Glenn Mulcaire to hack Pawlbys voicemails , and persecuted them , but Coulson also called on them and left behind news as the court learned .	-4.1248
“ According to the Public Prosecutor ’ s Office , Coulson , who is now the publisher of the NotW , is nobody who stands in front of the apartment of people and hopes to fall on fresh action , but one who likes to confront people with a story to see their reaction , ” said Edis .	-5.8972
He said that NotW uses three methods to investigate stories : telephone hacking , monitoring , and confrontation .	-2.2440
The publisher is personally involved in the third method .	-1.5744
Obviously he knows of the second , the monitoring , and otherwise it cannot be .	-3.2484
What about the first ?	-1.5578
Does he know about phone hacking ?	-2.0890
He disputes this , but we say , “ And whether he knew it . ”	-2.9345
Rumours about a Clarkes affair were initially taken up by NotW ’ s feature editorial when a source of sexual interest in Pawlby was said : “ Don ’ t waste your time , it ’ s with Charles . ”	-10.2913
A band with voicemails from their phone of at least three occasions was ensured in August 2006 in Mulcaires apartment .	-2.5871
The investigators also found entries on the detective computer where Pawlby and her sisters were saved as " projects " .	-2.9194
At the time when the research ran , the grandparents of Pawlby received anonymous calls asking them for information about them , Edis explained .	-3.6657
Meanwhile , former chief porter Neville Thurlbeck and former reporter James Weatherup overseen the monitoring of Pawlby movements .	-2.9137
On 18 June 2005 , Coulson left her a voicemail with the following content : “ I have a story we want to publish tomorrow , about which I would like to talk to Charles . ”	-3.7408
Edis explained that Coulson ’ s activities in this story followed the same pattern as other important personalities , such as former Home Secretary David Blunkett .	-3.3887
The words heard on Thursday that Coulson Blunkett faced a married woman because of an affair , when he was himself lied with the fellow Rebekah Brooks who had been married at the time .	-4.7831
Coulson and Brooks dispute having spoken to others to hack phones between 3 October 2000 and 9 August 2006 .	-3.2422
Mulcaire , Thurlbeck and Weatherup have admitted phone hacking .	-2.0606

Gemingen : No absolute protection possible	-1.9208
" We want to incorporate the inhabitants into planning early , " Mayor Jens Häusler opened the civil information event on the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-4.5863
Around 80 participants came into the community hall to explain the planned measures , to ask questions , to express concerns and to bring forward ideas .	-4.5706
Häu<unk>ler made it clear : ' The ultimate decisions are made by the members of the council ' .	-4.5593
The flooding , which met Gemeingen on 15 May 2009 , unprepared was a serious event that raised the question of protective measures for the future , according to Häu<unk>ler .	-5.0259
A river area investigation was commissioned with the neighbouring community of Aidlingen , which is now the basis for the flood protection concept in Gechingen .	-3.8834
" The protection of as many land as possible is the objective " , says Häu<unk>ler .	-3.1110
The planning of the protection against a statistical flood , according to the German weather service , is based on every 100 years .	-4.5970
Climate change is taken into account by a 15-percent supplement .	-2.7132
In specialist circles this is called " HQ 100aKlima " .	-2.8783
The water masses that caused considerable damage in 2009 in Gechingen corresponded to a 1000-year-old flood .	-3.4962
" There is no absolute protection , but we can achieve a relative improvement , " says Häu<unk>ler .	-2.8689
In order to achieve the protection of HQ 100aKlima , approximately EUR 4 million must be invested in Gechingen , with the municipality expecting approximately 70 % of national aid .	-6.5551
Häu<unk>ler pointed out , however , that promotion only exists if an overall concept is implemented .	-4.3408
The municipality needs citizens to participate in this .	-4.3348
A complex planning and authorisation procedure must be completed .	-2.2859
In the best case , 2016 can begin implementation .	-2.8506
Among other things , the protection concept , which was presented in the local council last week ( we reported ) provides for local measures in the influx of the river Irm from the heim valley .	-5.0782
Following the presentation of the flood protection concept , participants took the opportunity to contribute their concerns .	-2.9432
Amongst other things , it has been questioned why no more dams and restraint basins are planned to protect the place .	-3.8094
Gregor Kühn , specialist engineer 's office of forest and corbe from Hügelsheim , who presented the concept , emphasized the need for the interaction of all the measures presented to achieve the desired objective in the sum .	-5.6055
Moreover , it is important to find the most economic solution , according to Joachim Forest of Forest and Corbe .	-3.9476
There was displeasure among the ancient fishermen , who , even in normal thunderstorms , have to suffer from congestion of the channel network . , the is in the .	-14.7378
The problem is well known with administration , and initial measures have already been taken .	-10.4960
However , households pointed out that the directives on channel systems are different from those for flood protection and should not be mixed up .	-5.5506
The municipality is obliged to interpret the channel network in such a way that it could cope with two to three years of rainfall .	-4.2572
More dimensioning sewage channels would devour millions .	-2.4751
Serious injuries after collision	-2.1372
On the early Friday afternoon , two drivers were seriously injured on the road 44 near Revensdorf during a frontal collision .	-3.6185
The police immediately blocked the road completely , but at first little could say about the accident .	-4.6335
However , there are various testimonies that should be evaluated .	-3.0695
Certainly , the 19-year-old Lenkerin of a VW golf took the direction of Revensdorf and the 38-year-old man from Gettorf came with his Hyundai .	-5.4152
Both vehicles clashed together , with the woman clamped so heavily that the fire brigade needed half an hour to free her from the vehicle wreck .	-4.5558
The actual cause of the accident remained unresolved first .	-9.1935
Both accidents came to nearby hospitals .	-2.6175

Kendrick Johnson from Valdosta in the US federal state of Georgia was found on 11 January in an upright mat that was behind the gallery in the Schultnhalle .	-4.5895
The investigators of the Sheriff of Lowndes County concluded that Johnson died in a tragic accident , which doubts the 17-year-old family .	-3.6884
“ They are convinced that their son was murdered , ” explained Benjamin Crump , the lawyer of Kenneth and Jacquelyn Johnson , against FoxNews.com.	-2.7797
They never thought he died as the sheriff concluded .	-2.2805
“ They believe that any logic is unacceptable , violates the laws of physics and common sense , ” said Crump .	-4.3906
Rather , they are convinced that the truth is concealed to protect the person or person responsible for the death of their son .	-2.6938
“ Her son went to school and returned to corpse ” , he commented .	-2.9889
US prosecutor Michael Moore said on Thursday that there will be a formal investigation into the death of Johnson , because a number of important issues remain unresolved .	-2.9268
What was the cause of death ?	-0.8306
Is his death caused by a crime ?	-1.6837
This explained Moore at a press conference on Thursday afternoon .	-1.7839
I follow the facts in which direction they are lead.	-2.2161
My goal is to find out the truth .	-1.2929
“ I believe there is a sufficient basis for formal investigation , ” he said .	-2.5181
Moore explained to reporters that initial autopsy suggests that Johnson died as a result of “ position-related stifling . ”	-2.8327
But a second car showed another cause of death , Moore said .	-3.3720

CDC publish Schools Allergy Guidelines	-1.8504
On Wednesday , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) published a series of guidelines for dealing with food allergies for children at schools .	-2.8457
These are the first directives that the US administration has issued , as the number of school children with food allergies increases .	-4.1505
One in 20 children in the United States now has a food allergy .	-1.5518
According to the CDC , the spread of food allergies among children increased by 18 % between 1997 and 2007 .	-2.3820
The guidelines contain information for schools to raise awareness of food allergies among teachers and employees and how to deal with children showing allergic reactions .	-4.0562
It is also recommended that schools have Epinephrin in stock – the auto-injection of the brand EpiPen is most used – in order to meet a potentially deadly superiority response .	-4.6845
Legislators in states have recently changed the rules so that schools can keep epinephrin easier .	-3.0487
The report also contains a list of typical symptoms mentioned by children with allergic reactions .	-2.2543
Children may say : “ It feels as if something is pressing on my tongue , ” “ My tongue feels as if a hair is on it , ” or “ My tongue is cribbling . ”	-4.5254
Parents of intersexual children can choose “ gender undetermined ”	-2.6448
Germany is the first European nation in which a third gender is recognised for children born with unambiguous genitals .	-2.8374
Newborns are no longer assigned rigidly male or female .	-2.6613
According to the new law , parents no longer have to declare sex for such children , but may indefinitely indicate or “ not fixed ” on the certificate of birth .	-4.8462
The purpose of the law is to exert pressure from parents , so that they do not have to make hasty decisions regarding the sexual allocation of newborns , and to combat discrimination against intersexual people .	-5.6428
One intersexual person said , according to BBC years later , “ I am neither man nor woman . ”	-2.8250
I remain the patchwork created by doctors mutilated and full of scars .	-1.9763
It is estimated that one in 2,000 children does not come up as a boy or as a girl every year .	-9.1489
They are among the intersexuals , a group that is part of the diagnosis “ sexual differentiation disorder ” ( DSD ) , a collection for people with atypical chromosomes , germ glands ( eggs or hodes ) , or unusually developed genitals .	-5.0626
Wallis Simpson may have been intersexual .	-1.5230
The understanding of gender identification is still not very well developed , but most experts in the US advise that the best available information on gender allocation should be used if a provision is not possible , and not wait for the child ’ s psychological and physical development before opting – if any – for an operation .	-5.4338
The New York psychiatrist Dr. Jack Drescher , who specializes in the problem of gender identification , said that the new German law “ sounds like a good thing . ”	-3.6284
Intersexual children are an ethical dilemma .	-1.0881
“ Some people have life-threatening diseases that require surgical intervention , but not most children , ” he said .	-2.6705
You can assign sexes without surgery and then wait for identity to develop .	-4.0641
Scientific data on how a child actually develops its gender identity are not very accurate .	-2.6136
No one knows why it is happening .	-1.6257
It is like the mystery of why people are homosexual .	-2.0613
A report to the European Commission in 2011 states that intersexual people are to be distinguished by transsexual or transgender persons , because their status is not gender-based , but because of their biological constitution , which is neither male nor female , but typically both at the same time or not clearly defined as one of them .	-5.0631
These characteristics showed themselves in secondary sexual characteristics such as muscle mass , hair , breasts and stature , primary sexual characteristics , such as reproduction organs and genitals , or in chromosom structures and hormones .	-5.7274
The report also provides an overview of the discrimination faced by intersexual and transgender persons in professional life and the extent of harassment , violence and prejudice .	-3.6005
Not according to the gender picture boys now have a special camp .	-3.4060
In Australia and Nepal , it is now possible for adults to specify male , female or “ third sex ” on official documents .	-3.2150
In June , Australian Norrie May Welby ( 52 ) was recognized as the world ’ s first “ genderless ” person after a court granted lifelong retention of “ undetermined ” gender status .	-3.8565
In addition to M and W , German cards will have a third assignment , X for intersexually , so the Ministry of the Interior .	-3.8936
Gender topics are still controversial in neighboring France , such as a news message in . in , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.6230
In 2011 , dozens of French members of the strictly Catholic country signed a petition that “ gender theory ” should be removed from school books .	-2.3947
The US website Catholic Online has also opposed German law on the grounds that “ if the world is broken into a new state of affairs where gender is a decision , but not sexual activity , then we will turn two further pillars of civilisation . ”	-5.4682
The mother of a newborn in Maryland explained to Baby Zone that she would find it better if babies were assigned a sex at birth .	-4.4004
“ Without further restrictions , parent life is already stressful enough , especially if you do not know the sex of your child , ” she said the parent website .	-5.0544
Children need stability and security .	-0.5344
Historically , children born with both male and female genders were called hermaphrodites , according to the attractive Greek God who had both sexes .	-3.0516
Just ten years ago , medicine regarded gender as something that could be wiped out and rebuilt .	-3.3517
But now the ethical foundations of an operation are questioned , after we know how complex the gender identity is , and that doctors can also be wrong because they do not know how the child feels when growing up with the gender they allocate .	-5.4315
“ In the middle of the 20th century , it was called one , psychiatric emergency <unk> , ” said Drescher .	-3.1395
When such a child was born , the surgeon was not called the psychiatrist .	-3.2651
The prevailing theory on the treatment of children with unambiguous genitals is based on Dr. John Money from John Hopkins University , who argued that gender is formable .	-5.0694
He shaped the term “ gender identity , ” arguing social and environmental impetus – as parents educate a child – interacted with a child ’ s genes and hormones , shaping whether a person considers male or female .	-4.4453
But in a 1966 case known as “ John / Joan , ” his theories were controversial .	-3.2065
He advised the parents of a boy whose penis had been separated from a boy in the event of a plucked circumcision to castrate the child entirely and to remove his holds and then browse him as a girl .	-8.0092
“ Money presented this case as a successful example of conversion , which he was not , ” says Drescher .	-2.9036
When the boy was about 15 , he moved back to male gender and married a woman .	-2.1506
With 38 but he committed suicide .	-2.3666
According to screens , there are still doctors who would practise this model .	-3.1548
But in the 1990 ’ s , with the entry of the Internet , survivors of these sexual operations have come to the public , “ unhappy with the outcome . ”	-4.0092
For example , Jim Bruce , a 36-year-old Montana author , born with XY male chromosomes , but ambiguous genital .	-2.7673
Doctors were not clear whether he had a big clitoris or a small penis and were convinced that he could never lead a “ satisfactory life ” as a man .	-3.7600
So his external organ and the Hoden were surgically removed shortly after the birth of 1976 , and he was witnessed as a girl .	-4.3136
At the age of 12 he received female hormones .	-1.9100
“ I knew I am not a girl , ” he told ABCNews.com that he was not a girl .	-3.2782
I was unhappy , but it was really difficult to ask questions .	-1.3744
At the age of 18 he should receive a vaginal plastic .	-2.2508
But since he was depressive and knew something wrong , he demanded his medical files .	-3.3454
What he found was shocking .	-0.7395
I was sterilised at my birth – and no one ever told me that .	-2.6447
Bruce was born with a DSD , through which his body could not produce enough testosterone to develop the genital .	-3.0126
After learning the truth , he switched back to male identity , received testosterone injections and removed his breasts .	-3.0543
The operation has made it infertile .	-2.7451
Today he is fighting for others in an organisation called Interface Project for intersexual people to be perceived as normal .	-7.5074
But Anne Tamar-Mattis , Managing Director of the Advocates for Informed Choice legal group in California , worries that German law can “ encourage stamping and stigmatizing . ”	-3.4837
“ Many activists are worried that the German decision could encourage parents to make quick decisions and not allocate to the child , ” she explained .	-4.1303
We fear that favoures intervention .	-2.8586
We believe it would be better to allocate male or female gender and then wait .	-8.7820
But we do not yet know how the law will affect , so we can only speculate .	-2.2204
Tamar-Mattis said that her organisation supports Australian law , because “ it enables adults to recognize as a third sex . ”	-3.0578
“ Adults should be able to make their own decisions about their legal sex , ” she explained .	-2.4980
German law is about assigning birth to the German law .	-9.4590
This is not a battle to force small children to do so at this time .	-2.5508
When they grow up , they can decide for themselves on their bodies .	-3.1351
But Dr. Arlene Baratz , a brustradiologist from Pittsburg , who has a daughter with sexual differentiation and supports hundreds of others in a self-help group , says that the German law “ authorized ” both parents and children .	-3.7716
Katie , the daughter of Baratz , was born with male chromosomes , but has a DSD called complete drug resistance .	-2.2685
The category of female characteristics developed by the recipe device of targets for testosterone .	-4.1154
She has a vagina , but no uterus and no eggs .	-1.8573
Today , Katie 29 is married ; she is working at the University of Pennsylvania as a staff in the psychiatry of children .	-10.3276
Although it is infertile , it hopes to have a child through adoption or a surrogate mother .	-2.9318
“ The law gives parents space , which means that they do not have to take decisions overwhelmingly , ” said Baratz .	-4.1658
It gives them the time to do different tests and clarify things , giving them time before writing “ male ” or “ female ” .	-4.0910
In this way everything is fine – you draw the child large and you love it .	-4.1291
You have a wonderful baby and enjoy parental happiness .	-2.6510
And you do not need to rush an operation that can no longer be undone .	-3.7141
“ This includes children in the decision and eliminates the fear that parents are afraid of doing the right thing , ” she explained .	-4.1631
Ultimately , the child decides on the sex that better fits him – and that is wonderful .	-8.5251
This will enable children to make the decision themselves .	-1.9509
Unknown Girls Injure Girls from Car Shot	-3.9757
Unknown people in shoots from a car injured a twelve years in Saxony-Anhalt .	-3.8574
The perpetrators had probably fired a group of children on Thursday night in Genthin with an air pressure weapon .	-3.0022
This was announced by the police in Burg .	-2.4573
The girl was slightly injured on the left wade . .	-12.1829
Rescue forces brought the girl to the hospital .	-2.2541
The shot came from a small car that had passed a group of six children and suddenly stopped .	-2.4321
Witnesses saw two people sitting in the car .	-1.0757
The perpetrators also shot on a bus stop .	-1.5930
A disc broke up .	-7.0147
They then took it .	-2.5050
The criminal police were identified on Friday .	-3.3630
Until now , police inspection Kempten can look back on a quiet Halloween night .	-3.1797
The officials have only been called twice to celebrate children who threw them against home facades .	-4.0658
Since homeowners recognized this in time and removed the eggs at the same time , no material damage should have been caused .	-5.2962
Furthermore , some sylvester petroleum petroleums were burned in the urban area , but no material damage was caused either .	-7.3698
A resident in the Bischof-Friendorfer-Weg reported that his car was wrapped with clopaper and his bicycle blends were removed .	-4.7822

Housing with a future perspective	-2.6602
Waltraud Ries really lives dreamlessly .	-3.1357
Located in a quiet residential area of Stuttgart with a lot of green , an old tree stand , nice neighbours and not too much traffic .	-11.3916
It is only a few minutes away from the city by public transport .	-3.1513
" Hopefully you are not afraid of spinning ? " asks Waltraud Ries and indicates a fat spider at the door frame .	-3.7024
I have been looking for a new apartment for my husband and myself for some time .	-1.9694
But you know how difficult it is in Stuttgart .	-1.5035
The reason , however , is not a spinning phobia , but the concern that the many stairs in the house and in the apartment can no longer be managed at age is explained .	-6.7433
Moreover , since a Meniskus operation , the mid-fifties have experienced their own body , which means moving from floor to floor with handicap .	-4.7609
Just recently , a book from her appeared on the subject of ' Luckily live in age - What kind of living is the best for me ? ' .	-5.5365
'Our apartment is the best example of what doesn 't go at all , ' it starts to tell .	-5.0101
When she went to the Maisonette apartment more than 20 years ago with her husband , it was simply a beautiful apartment in the middle of the green .	-4.2029
Today , by mid-fifty , Waltraud Ries thinks differently about it .	-2.3824
She also knows , however , that it is one of the few people who deal with the issue of ' living in old ' .	-4.2156
Most are displacing it as long as it goes .	-3.9430
Always only the others ' , says it smiles .	-3.6539
Only when the pressure of suffering is really great are we going to think about it .	-3.7994
'Then it may be too late ' , says Ries .	-2.9468
In their book the interior architecture introduces 17 housing models for a self-determined living at age .	-4.1191
'Which form of residence you choose is always an individual decision ' , she explains .	-3.3730
D i e solution does not exist for age .	-1.9704
Even those who can afford to rest in Tuscany or Brittany should always consider that they can become sick .	-3.5846
And : ' Without good knowledge of the local language , one can also get to grips with the Dolce Vita , ' gives the specialist bookseller willing to consider .	-6.9437
Among its models are classic care models , alternative forms of residence or the often quoted Pensioner WG .	-10.0348
At age , everyone has their ticks and paintings in this way .	-15.1945
'For me , such a housing community would be nothing ' , she says .	-5.3435
Not like a student ’ s WG with a common bathroom and a kitchen .	-4.2962
" At age you need your retreat rooms " , says Ries .	-5.0555
However , the book author does not want to rule out the fact that a senior residence community can still function .	-3.9032
But this should be different from the classic student WG .	-4.5247
And sometimes you just want his peace ' , she believes .	-3.5704
With this opinion , it is not alone , at least in the capital of the state .	-4.2095
" Most old people in Stuttgart want to stay in their own apartment " , is also the experience of Theresa Rütten , the head of civil service life at the age of the state capital .	-4.4413
Their department advises people around the theme ' become older ' .	-4.4095
That is why older people would often also take advantage of inconvenience and restrictions , only to remain in their usual environment , that is also the experience of the Warentest Foundation .	-5.4633
Today there are many ways of making the house or the apartment accessible .	-4.4386
Ries recommends that everyone who is involved in the reconstruction of their house or apartment to learn about it thoroughly and not appoint the first craftsman .	-7.5189
Today there are also specialists for age-oriented renovation .	-3.7456
Even in the rental apartment you can realize one thing or another , and if it is only the toilet seat increase , the interior architecture clarifies .	-5.9045
But it is not always possible to renovate the existing apartment according to age and thus accessible , even if it is still so beautiful .	-5.6685
This experience had to be done by Waltraud Ries .	-2.4852
Although one could install a staircase lift within the apartment , the way to the flat door also paved with stairs would be a much greater obstacle .	-6.3490
She will continue searching for the ideal object for her and her husband .	-2.7994
Before the move it greets her more than before the spider at her home door .	-4.3463
USA wants Snowden to continue to prosecute criminal law .	-3.0314
The US has not changed its position as former US intelligence official Edward Snowden .	-2.7977
He is still accused of having given secret information unauthorized .	-3.1697
So he must face a criminal proceedings in the US , said the spokesman of the US State Department , Jennifer Psaki , in Washington .	-3.6956
Recent Snowden statements would not change that either .	-2.9288
Previously , German Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele , after a meeting with Snowden in Moscow , appealed to the US not to puni.	-4.1267
Psaki emphasized that Ströbel 's statements were one of a parliamentarian , not that of a German government member .	-3.9360
The intelligence agency Edward Snowden is basically ready to talk to German authorities .	-4.7084
But he wants to know his situation first .	-7.2568
This was made clear by the former NSA staff sought by the USA in an unaddressed letter published by the Green politician Hans-Christian Ströbele on Friday after a meeting with Snowden and forwarded to the Federal Government , the Federal Government , and the Federal Prosecutor .	-5.4284
The letter has the following wording :	-3.0718
Responsible	-1.8992
I have been asked to write to you regarding your investigation into mass monitoring .	-2.4592
I am called Edward Joseph Snowden and was previously contracted or employed as a technical expert at the National Security Agency ( NSA ) , the Central Intelligence Agency ( CIA ) and the Defense Intelligence Agency ( DIA ) of the United States .	-4.0511
In the course of my work in these institutions , I witnessed systematic infringements of my government , which led me to take moral action .	-4.6301
As a result of publishing these concerns , I saw a serious and lasting heat that forced me to leave my family and my home .	-3.9120
I live in exile at the moment and enjoy temporary asylum granted to me by the Russian Federation in accordance with international law .	-2.7033
I am encouraged by the resonance to my political action , both in the United States and elsewhere .	-1.9212
Citizens around the world , and also senior officials - including the United States - have judged revelations on a system of overall supervision that is not accountable to anyone as a public service .	-4.7981
These spy revelations entailed many proposals on new laws and directives aimed at the previously hidden abuse of public confidence .	-3.9019
The benefits of society from these findings are becoming increasingly clear , while at the same time the risks associated with purchase have been clearly reduced .	-5.0670
Although the result of my efforts has been demonstrably positive , my government is still treating dissent as a loyalty and seeking to criminalise and charge political opinion .	-4.0406
However , speaking out the truth is not a crime .	-2.3876
I am confident that , with the support of the international community , the United States Government will adopt this disgraceful stance .	-3.6923
I hope that , when the difficulties of this humanitarian situation are resolved , I will be able to take appropriate and legitimate account of the facts concerning the statements made in the media , particularly with regard to the truth and authenticity of the reports .	-4.9307
I look forward to talking to you in your country once the situation is settled and thank you for your efforts to safeguard international law , which protects us all .	-4.1106

" The building is in good hands " , says Winterlingen 's mayor Michael Maier .	-1.7015
The former kindergarten in the garden road has sold the municipality to a private person .	-3.6766

The budget allocated EUR 100 000 .	-2.1068
It is not yet clear how the new owner wants to use the former kindergarten .	-2.0192
The Mayor is right that winter lings have given responsibility to someone else before the winter and therefore no longer have to pay for the entertainment of the house , how to heat , watch the garden and clean up the path .	-13.7531

Report : Obama campaign considered replacing Biden with Hillary Clinton	-1.2401
President Barack Obama ’ s closest advisers in secret considered replacing Vice-President Joe Biden with Hillary Clinton in 2012 , the New York Times .	-2.9005
The revelation is the most notable surprise of the long-awaited work of Mark Halperin and John Heilemann over the 2012 election campaign , “ Double Down : Game Change 2012 . ”	-3.1921
The Times is a copy of the forthcoming book , and on Thursday night she reported that the president ’ s top consultants had carried out “ extensive group meetings and surveys at the end of 2011 ” to find out whether Obama ’ s declining hope of re-election would be better if he dropped Biden .	-5.8356
According to Jonathan Martin , Times ’ national correspondent , the book thoroughly traces the history of the efforts of leading Campaign and the White House , notably the former White House Chief of Staff Bill Daley , to measure the impact it has on poll rates to exchange former Foreign Minister Clinton against Vice-President .	-5.6432
Potential change was a strictly kept secret within the campaign infrastructure in Chicago and the Oval Office .	-2.3522
Only half a dozen of the president ’ s closest advisers – including Daley , former campaign leader Obama , Jim Messina , and former White House senior advisers , David Axelrod and David Plouffe – knew how to change .	-3.7936
“ Double Down ” claims that Daley took the lead in exchanging Biden despite its “ narrow , personal relationship , ” before finally deciding to reject such a move after the data showed that Clinton ’ s candidacy “ would not significantly improve Obama ’ s chances . ”	-5.2498
In an interview with Martin , Daley confirmed that the government actually considered replacing Biden with Clinton .	-1.8643
“ I said a whole series of things to be considered , and that was one of them , ” Daley explained to the magazine .	-3.0106
It must be remembered that the president had terrible poll values at the time , so we thought , “ For God ’ s will , what do we do ? ”	-3.8275
While Daley described the investigations as “ due diligence , ” Martin said to Anderson Cooper of CNN that considerable effort had been made during the re-election campaign to determine whether such a train would pay off for the ballot boxes .	-5.1145
“ In campaigns , not so much money is spent on surveys and focus groups unless you think seriously about something , ” Martin explained to AC360 .	-4.0600
But it is not clear whether Obama knew that his team was thinking about exchanges .	-2.0093
Martin said to CNN that he asked Daley whether his boss at that time knew about the potential change .	-2.8465
Although Daley declared that he did not believe that the president was “ aware ” of the possible change , the former chief of staff admitted that it was “ possible ” that Obama knew it .	-11.8242
Martin added that “ Double Down ” did not provide a definitive answer to the question as to whether Obama ’ s political probations would have reached Obama ’ s desk .	-3.2188
Cooper asked Martin whether he seriously thought Obama did not know any of the investigations into whether to drop bids in the elections .	-4.1326
Martin replied “ Possibly ” .	-8.1679
What happens to me on the road ?	-2.1658
E-mail is actually called an electronic letter .	-2.1931
Was email similar to conventional post secrecy implemented in the design of the Internet service ?	-5.0808
In the design of early Internet services , the emphasis was on making communication possible .	-3.8644
Therefore , the basic technical protocols did not take care to create a stable foundation for a listen-safe exchange of letters .	-4.9277
Therefore , a conventional e-mail is more like an open postcard than a sealed letter .	-2.8070
If user " Anna " sends a mail to " Benni " , are the two computers directly connected ?	-9.5861
The e-mail program or the Anna browser will send the mail to the mail server of your service provider in the first step .	-3.9725
For example , if it has a GMail account , it would be Google .	-2.4012
This mail server sends the content to the Benni provider .	-1.9174
On the route the mail can be run via a number of other servers on the Internet .	-3.6644
Bennie can then call the content to its provider .	-2.1768
Will conventional mails be read on their way through the network ?	-3.4300
Most mails are read by software robots on the road several times .	-2.5546
The sender provider usually checks that the mail is attached to a mail program .	-4.4547
A virus check is also made on the receiver systems .	-2.4088
Furthermore , the providers check whether this is a burdensome and unwanted spam mail , which is deleted immediately or at least moved to a spam folder .	-5.6426
Do the robots have another job ?	-2.0429
For systems like GMail , the robot also determines the information Google needs to place context advertising .	-2.5921
If Anna and Benni communicate via GMail about their upcoming holiday trip , Google can display relevant links to holiday offers .	-3.8575
Do unknown people also read the e-mails with ?	-3.0045
The likelihood that unauthorized persons read a mail is extremely low .	-2.8179
In theory , however , that is possible .	-8.0915
In companies , administrators are often able to read electronic mail .	-2.9650
The law enforcement authorities and intelligence services also have legal means of intercepting or notifying e-mails .	-3.5603
There are also possible illegal suspension actions .	-3.8134
Is it possible to protect e-mails against colleagues ?	-9.3282
With an encryption according to the OpenPGP standard , an email can be effectively encrypted against colleagues .	-4.1060
With a high technical effort , it is also possible to conceal metadata from an email communication so that it is not even easy to identify who communicated with whom .	-13.4389
How important are Yahoo and Google on the e-mail market in Germany ?	-1.3680
Yahoo and Google , according to a study by Convios Consulting from August 2013 , play a minor role in the mainly privately used mailboxes .	-4.3798
While Yahoo-Mail ’ s shares had recently fallen , GMail could clearly show up from Google .	-4.2942
Mother in the forest hardens and retirement cashe.	-11.6144
When his prayer died , a man from Wolfsburg forged a plan .	-2.0325
He buried the dead in a forest - and continued to cash their pensions and care money .	-4.2684
In order to collect further pensions and care allowances , a 67-year-old Wolfsburg has buried his dead mother in the forest after police investigations .	-4.8786
First he covered the death of the 89-year-old , then he cut the money over a year and a half .	-3.5961
Now , as a speaker said on Friday , the 67-year-old must answer for fraud .	-3.0300
So the man hidden the woman in a forest near Helmstedt .	-1.9259
The man was suspected already in May : at that time it became clear that no drugs were needed for the needy mother .	-4.4155
Investigators told the pensioner that his mother had travelled to Spain .	-10.0473
Because officials were strange about this , they continued to identify it .	-4.3697
It turned out that the two had lived in a common flat for more than 15 years , and that he had maintained it last .	-4.5815
The 67-year-old finally admitted the death of his mother .	-2.8822
According to the police , there was no evidence of a capital crime .	-2.8525
Fancy ice cream that shines in the dark ?	-3.2373
A British entrepreneur has developed the first bright ice in the dark – with the help of qualles .	-3.9679
Charlie Francis exploited the fluorescent characteristics of the sea animals and created a bright leakage .	-3.8091
The idea came to him after reading a research on qualles and persuading Chinese scientists to artificially produce shining protein .	-4.3797
The ice cream reacts with the tongue when eating , raising the pH value in the protein and triggering light .	-3.8057
Chris explains that the food ice reacts to the heat in the mouth and shines – the more you lick , the brighter it becomes .	-5.1100
Charlie , founder of the “ Lick Me I ’ m Delicious ” ice cream company , says , “ The product is incredible , but still in a very early production phase , and so you get two grams of it for 200 pounds . ”	-3.8604
The protein used in the ice cream reacts with the tongue at a neutral pH value .	-1.7035
When the mouth heats the protein , the pH value and the ice shines .	-3.1218
We have tested it over the last few months and it seemed to us ideal to put it on the market in Halloween because it has this wonderful light effect .	-4.4274
It is probably the most expensive ice cream I have ever produced , because the luminaire is four times more expensive than gold .	-2.7731
Each ball costs me about 140 pounds .	-1.5905
But it tastes delicious .	-1.5912
Charlies experimental company based in Bristol is famous for its unusual flavours , including beer , cheese , beef and gold .	-2.5670
But his latest creation should become more ambitious .	-8.3482
He says : “ I would like to develop an invisible ice cream . ”	-1.8143
This is , in itself , impossible due to the illumination caused by the ice crystals , which consists of ice cream , but I suspect we find a way to create it .	-5.9302
The ice cream uses the fluorescent properties of a resource artificially produced by Chinese scientists .	-3.2472
After six days of play , the TSV Morsum is still without any point in the Handball Association League .	-3.3848
Tomorrow , Ingo Ehlers ’ team will be on the Derby against the TSV Daverden , who celebrated his first victory last weekend .	-5.3047
With this game the season starts new for us .	-2.0117
" I hope that we finally have the head free , " Ehlers behaves optimistically .	-3.7340
In doing so , he has finally available his full cader with the exception of the permanent Hendrik Blohme .	-5.8526
Like us , Daverden also relies on tempogame .	-3.6853
Therefore , we need to keep our error rate low .	-7.6998
First and foremost , however , we need to increase the cover , which has left anything but a secure impression .	-11.0991
Daverdens Coach Thomas Panitz becomes more relaxed after the first season victory against Nordhorn .	-4.1272
The game was of course a house number .	-1.5020
But that ’ s why we ’ re not the favorite , because everything can always happen in the Derby .	-3.9735
Nevertheless , Panitz now wants to launch a series in Morsum .	-2.5845
Missing will Jan-Malte Jodate .	-2.0283
For this purpose , the A-youth Joost Windsus<unk> , who is active with double playing law at the HC Bremen A-Youth Ligist , is celebrating his seasonal debut .	-6.1047
Whoever is not hot in such a game should stay at home .	-2.9562
Halloween 2013 : Numbers	-13.7250
When I was small , Halloween had something magic .	-1.8486
My sister and I were allowed to eat sweets , stay late and cloth us for the neighborhood .	-3.3967
Today I became the Halloween Muffel .	-3.0096
Over the last two years I have not agreed to distribute my apartment from sweets , and I do not think that this year .	-5.0265
But according to statistics , I am a black sheep in Halloween .	-2.3288
The majority of Americans – 158 million to be precise – celebrate Halloween this year , spending a total of $ 6.9 billion on sweets , costumes , and decorations , according to the US Retailer Association ( NRF ) .	-3.2732
One thing that I look forward to every Halloween is the trend values .	-3.2373
The costumes will account for about $ 1.2 billion of the $ 6.9 billion spent , so the NRF .	-9.4808
This year , exciting unbridled objects are the last cry .	-3.6751
Women no longer have to cover in sexy clothes , they can now embody tempting food such as pizza , hamburgers or carrots .	-3.8827
As far as men are concerned , I expect a lot of zombies thanks to The Walking Dead , and I bet that the Daft Punk space men will make it into the Instagram feeds this year .	-3.8225
According to Google , most searched costumes are zombies , batman , pirates and witches .	-2.3234
I suspect it is nothing wrong with tradition .	-2.0991
We dressed our dogs last year and I was not surprised to hear them alone .	-4.3946
Indeed , Americans spend $ 330 million this year on costumes of their pets , according to the NRF .	-2.2089
These are a lot of hot dogs .	-2.2964
As far as sweets are concerned , we are not strange .	-4.1882
Americans will spend $ 1.9 billion this year , says The Nielsen Company .	-1.4744
These are about 270 million kilograms of chocolate bars , lutches , bonbars and rubber bears .	-4.5607
So good news for the US Trade Department is that 41 million people are moving around the quarter with the saying “ sweets or saures . ”	-12.2325
In fact , we will buy more than 40 million kilograms of chocolate for Halloween and – let us not mind – eat it .	-3.1703
The only thing we do not want to consume is the sugar-sweet candy corn , yet 15 million kilograms of it are sold around Halloween , according to the National Association of sweets manufacturers .	-4.3481
These are about nine billion maize grains .	-2.4083
It is a puzzle that I have not yet been able to solve .	-2.3608
Nothing belongs to Halloween as houses where it spucks .	-9.6578
They have great names like “ Terror Behind the Walls ” ( which , incidentally , is in real prison ) , “ Howl-O-Scream ” and “ The House of Shock . ”	-8.9890
Indeed , there are 1,200 officially recognized spukhouses in the United States that earn $ 500 million , America Haunts , and this includes the wonderful photographs on which to pink into trousers and then place friends on Facebook , where they are not released , and one of the types on which one stands leaves a comment like “ nice face expression . ”	-7.0903
But let us finally get to the cumbers .	-2.6683
Charlie Brown familiarized us with the Great Kurbi when we were children , and the cutting of a pumpkin leather is like the decoration of the Christmas tree – something we made from small .	-5.5115
Fortunately , the “ baby in Kürbis ” trend began only last year thanks to Pinterest , so most of us grew up with the cumbers and not sitting in them .	-4.7178
This year , Americans will spend about $ 106 million on pumpkin , the US Census Bureau .	-2.8683
The pumpkin leather , which is slowly rotting in the front garden , is probably from Illinois , where 245 million kilograms of pumpkin have been harvested this year .	-4.4123
If you want to make the right points , call Tintin and Susan Mathisdon in Napa , California and cut some delicious cumbers out of their 921 kilo heavy Kürbis .	-5.3123
Holiday Fire in Helmbrecht : Rescue forces mountain bodies carved corpses .	-11.7398
The fire brigade had to leave in Helmrecht on Thursday evening .	-3.9264
A three-family house in the district of Hof catches up to Friday fire during the night .	-3.9130
The rescue forces mount a cold corpse from the house .	-3.1834
Rescue forces have found a carved corpse in a three-family house at a fire in Helmbrecht .	-4.6101
Whether it is a resident is still unclear , as a police spokesman said in Bayreuth .	-3.2070
It burned on the ground floor of the house late Thursday evening .	-2.5044
When the fire brigade arrived , the flames already beat from a window .	-2.5826
The staff went to the apartment and found the corpse in a room .	-3.2882
This and another room burnt out completely .	-2.8840
The whole ground floor was damaged .	-1.6077
All other inhabitants were not at home during the fire , the police spokesman continued .	-3.2691
The building is no longer available for the time . in in . in the of .	-13.8075
The exact cause of the fire was initially unclear .	-2.7451
Germany 's largest church has an offensive style to advertise the pastor 's profession .	-10.8207
Background is a potential parish shortage : the Gospel-Lutheran Church of Hannover expects the number of its current 1,800 pastors to be halved by 2030 .	-5.1845
For young people today , the profession is very attractive and offers good prospects for the future , said Pastor Mathis Burfien ( 43 ) in conversation with the Evangelical press service .	-3.8917
It is attractive to be able to determine the working and day-to-day procedure . . in . , is . , , , , ,	-9.0801
With Burfien , the Church of Landeskirche for the first time commissioned a pastor on a full spot to inspire young people to study theology .	-5.6419
At the moment , fewer and fewer young people choose to study theology after the abitur . is .	-10.5199
Burfien brings this back to the process of decirculation : " God 's voice is quiet , the world is loud " .	-4.2747
The profession is characterised by great freedom and diversity .	-2.3481
I am a member of my calendar and I can place my priorities where it is important to me .	-4.1452
Pastors could be very close to people as a seelsorger .	-3.5627
They deserved as much as teachers and could live well from it .	-2.4399
Surely more is paid in the free economy , but theologians would have a safe employer to do so .	-4.1103
This is something for the young people of today , who are not just talking about careers , but about meaningful work .	-5.2885
According to the Lower Saxony Church , about 60 pastors retire each year .	-2.9315
At the same time , about 40 graduates from a theological study begin their Vikariat .	-3.7037
In sparsely populated peripheral areas such as resin , Emsland or Wendland , it will be difficult to fill jobs in future .	-3.6243
Burfien wants to organize study days for young people , among other things , and to invite celebrities who have studied theology .	-4.2751
The theology study provides a wide range of training .	-3.5278
You can even become Federal President .	-2.7595
Land Rover Rally Series announced Land Rover Rally Series announced .	-1.8067
The interior features a six-point belt and a free speaking system .	-4.0258
The options range from strengthened brakes , a service package with support from Bowler-Works mechanics and logistical support to vehicle relocation between events .	-4.1205
Drew Bowler , Managing Director of Bowler Motorsport , explains : “ Rally customers coming to Bowler have changed . ”	-2.4656
They are not all experienced racing drivers , but people who are looking for excitement and adventure as well as an accessible way to world class events .	-4.6856
We are pleased to open this path in partnership with Land Rover and MSA , and believe that the format opens up new possibilities for experiencing the various rally disciplines in Britain and abroad and preparing newcomers for the stresses and reality of Rally Raid .	-5.3935
We really enjoyed developing the Defender Challenge car – that will be an entertaining championship .	-2.7596
In addition , the Defender Challenge offers a training and test day in February , as well as the option of participating in desert races in North Africa and the Middle East .	-3.4616
A fire brigade called to rescue a hut , which was fixed on a dangerous rock jump in a quarry 15 metres above the ground in a quarry .	-6.3695
Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was running away after a smaller road accident .	-10.7195
Three days later , she was discovered by a walker in a quarry in her predicament in her predicament location .	-4.5470
Fire officers were on rock wall and rescued the dog from safe death .	-4.4758
The fire brigade succeeded in securing a dog in a rock wall at a height of 15 meters .	-4.7312
The nine months old Cockerspaniel-Hündin Ruby was running out after a traffic accident on Sunday afternoon and survived for three days alone before she was rescued from a quarry on Wednesday . . in , was in . was in . , , was ,	-10.2226
Scott Alderson , 25 , and his girlfriend Becky Hall , 20 of whom the dog belongs , came to the quarry Flappit in Denholme , West Yorkshire , to reception Ruby and thank the fire fighters of the West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service .	-3.8709
They had desperately sought for their missing bitch and published a cry for help in social networks when they had fallen into the quarry after the small traffic accident .	-6.2483
About 14 : 15 on Wednesday , a walker who took his dog saw the stranded ruby on the 15 metre high paragraph in quarry .	-4.9759
The Cleckheaton Fire Station ’ s technical rescue team was running and was then transported to the top of a dog box .	-5.2243
Andy Clayton , the technical rescue team specialist , said : “ She was in a dangerous position .	-2.2169
It was located in the middle of the rock wall – 15 meters from above and the ground .	-3.1853
She did not move a muscle during her rescue – she was like frozen .	-2.9750
But now it is doing it well .	-2.1003
She then eaten a few dog cakes .	-2.6856
This was a fairly unusual use .	-3.0037
The fact that the dog was discovered is incredible .	-1.4832
Peter Lau , the technical rescue team specialist , said : “ Ruby had a huge happiness . ”	-2.7772
It was possible that it was very seriously injured or worse .	-1.6923
Ruby was brought to the veterinary examination , but he did not notice anything but exhaustion and dehydration .	-4.5416
Becky Hall from Halifax , West Yorkshire , said : “ Watching the bailout was frightening . ”	-2.5339
I could not believe that she was really there above .	-3.0967
It was wonderful to keep them back in the poor .	-1.7185
The vet explained that if exhaustion had become too large and had collapsed , it would probably have crashed .	-3.2977
The fire fighters have done a great deal .	-2.1967
It was really courageous what they did .	-2.0697
We are just as grateful and each of them was absolutely incredible .	-2.2812
Scott Alderson from Keighley added , “ We were afraid that it would fall , but it remained above . ”	-2.8216
The fire fighters were great .	-1.5424
I can hardly believe where it was .	-1.2119
Mick Jagger explains that he never made Kay Perry when she was 18 .	-8.5214
In an interview with an Australian radio station this week , the pop-star said she had worked as a background singer to Jagger ’ s song “ Old Habits The Hard ” from 2004 .	-4.0868
Perry explained that she had eaten with the aldryer in the evening , and that “ he moved me when I was 18 ” .	-4.8409
She added , ‘ That has been a long time ago and he was very nice to me ’ .	-3.1199
In a statement , a representative of Jaggers , 70 , said on Thursday that he “ categorically denied that he ever tried to bring about approximation at Kay Perry . ”	-4.0361
The representative added : “ Perhaps she confused him with someone else . ”	-2.1313
Perry was one of the singers who had a guest appearance at the Rolling Stones tour this year .	-2.4167

George Kerevan : European unbundling gives the Scots the choice .	-1.6434
A new day , a new horror story about independence .	-1.8351
This time we are being warned that an independent Scotland is needed to join the Schengen area as a condition for EU membership .	-2.0891
This provides the keyword for stories about passport controls in Berwick and a barbed wire secured border along the Hadrian Wall .	-3.1803
Indeed , the Strathclyde template referred to the potential economic benefits that would bring more freedom of travel in the rest of Europe , but , expectably , that played no part in the headlines .	-4.5596
Nor has anyone mentioned that EU member states often put their strict rules into practice when it is more favourable to them .	-11.4564
Since Scotland does not currently belong to the Schengen area , continued non-attention to Brussels would be just a small concession in exchange for what we really want from the Sco. , . in . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , is , , , . is ,	-17.0756
So actually no story .	-1.7987
And one that has come so long ago that it is already a fossil : the first time I heard the “ independence means passport controls ” duck at least 40 years ago .	-4.7830
An interesting point is lost in the constant repetition of this ancient history .	-2.6159
Why should an independent Scotland be expected to dance according to the European pipe ?	-9.0210
Why exchange the London yoke against that of Brussels , especially now ?	-2.2412
These are the real news of Europe : the big post-war plan for uniting Europe has stalled .	-3.0548
With the euro crisis , the European project has officially died .	-2.1850
Throughout the EU , parties are gaining ground that are anti-EU or want to throw the euro out as a common currency .	-3.1770
Even in Germany , the Eurosceptic Alternative for Germany – founded only this year – was able to gather almost five million votes in the September federal election , effectively driving the Free Democrats ( the equivalent to the British Liberal Democrats ) out of the Bundestag .	-4.6330
There has always been domestic opposition to the plan to create a federalist Europe .	-1.6549
But the current economic crisis turns out to be a turning point .	-1.5127
Because of the strict austerity policy imposed by Berlin and the European Central Bank in connection with the straitjacket in which the national economy is required by adhering to the single currency , many people believe that the European project has gone too far .	-4.4007
The euro crisis has little to do with national governments causing excessive fiscal deficits – only in Greece .	-2.3941
Instead , the euro system has fixed its members to exchange rates that are beneficial to German exporters – and that is what German politicians would like to leave .	-4.1277
Without the possibility of devaluing the local currency , southern Europe has a built-in productivity disadvantage over Germany .	-2.7977
The only way to cut wages and public spending – spurred by Berlin .	-2.2091
There is a deeper European productivity problem behind the current budgetary and monetary problems .	-2.3406
As a result of the “ green ” energy directives imposed by Brussels – a code for subsidising French and German energy companies at the expense of consumers – European industry pays twice in electricity and four times for gas compared to the United States .	-3.4187
This is a paralysing cost disadvantage , as we have seen in Grangemouth .	-2.0412
All world wage fixes do not protect European petrochemical industry from being pushed into the corner by cheap American shale gas .	-2.7288
As a result , a revolt is drawing up , especially in France , the former EU cheerleader .	-2.8121
After the war , France ’ s political elite saw the EU as a vehicle with which Germany could be kept in check and Paris lifted on an equal footing with Washington .	-3.7207
But Berlin no longer needs Paris as a gateway to political legitimacy , and has pushed Europe into its own economic policy , with which the struggling French economy is struggling .	-4.7013
The result is that Marine Le Pen ’ s right-wing anti-EU National Front has just won a crucial record , thus pointing the governing socialists to place three .	-5.0196
The National Front is now the most popular party in France , with 24 % of votes – a timely warning for the British Labour Party that it cannot assume that division in the right spectrum would automatically bring benefits to the left .	-4.1024
What does Le Pen do with its newly gained popularity among the white French working-class ?	-3.0634
It wants to use next year 's EU elections to forge an anti-EU , anti-common currency bloc in the European Parliament .	-2.3451
If the anti-EU parties do well in these elections – and this is very well possible – then for the first time such a bloc could dominate the European Parliament .	-3.5802
This is the point I want to make : in the not too distant future , the growing resentment against the EU and the single currency will meet to abolish the euro .	-3.5486
The EU will not disappear , but it will become something like the “ Europe of ( sovereign ) nations ” favored by General de Gaulle .	-2.2419
Germany and some of its satellite economies may hold on to the euro , but France and Southern Europe will return to their own currencies .	-2.7837
I expect Britain to distance itself from this project in the hope of flattering in the US .	-3.7470
But Washington ’ s growing interest in the Pacific suggests that Britain alone will be in the Atlantic rain .	-1.9883
Where does Scotland stand for ?	-1.8125
We can decide to be a region of ( ultimately ) small England .	-2.4626
Or we can defend our own economic interests – including telling Berlin and Brussels what they can hide .	-3.2425
I suspect that Scotland could go very well in a looser European association , provided we keep our own currency .	-4.3931
Cooperation with other similar countries is easier in an unfederated Europe of nations .	-2.2948

The SNP government in Scotland is , remarkably , the most successful political movement against austerity in Europe and gained a spectacular majority in 2011 because of the rejection of the proposed ( and implemented ) cuts that Labour Treasury Secretary Alistair Darling and the subsequent Tory Lib Dem coalition .	-4.2781
It would be ridiculous for Scotland to decide now for independence only to have austerity imposed by Berlin and Brussels .	-3.3328

Should a mother be worried if her daughter grows breasts and shame already at the age of seven or eight ?	-2.9935
At the annual Conference of the Children ’ s Medical Association American Academy of Pediatrics this week in Orlando , Florida , the paediatric endocrinologist Dr. Paul Kaplowitz explained that these early physical changes were relatively normal among American girls and a . in , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.2324
“ I spend a lot of time reassuring parents – normally it is no sign that puberty is now rapidly entering , ” explained Kaplowitz .	-4.5198
Obvious advertisements of development , such as growing breasts , shame and axle hairs and body smells , are shown earlier in girls .	-4.3170
Nevertheless , there was only a slight shift in the age of the menarch ( the first regular blood occurrence ) in the last 40 years .	-4.0494
In the United States , the average age is 12.5 years , slightly less than 12.75 in 1970 .	-1.7909
“ When the development of breasts begins , it takes at least two to three years to menarche , ” said Kaplowitz , also author of the book “ Early puberty in girls : the essential adviser to deal with this frequently occurring problem . ”	-4.8067
Time is the most accurate test of how puberty progresses .	-1.7045
It is controversial about what is actually the beginning of puberty , but it is “ early mature ” to accompany the increase in breast from a growth boost of eight years ago .	-5.9800
In most cases , the process slows or stagnates – something a child ’ s doctor can monitor closely .	-3.0581
When advancing more quickly , tests could be displayed by an endicronologist to prevent serious problems such as tumours or cysts .	-4.5232
There are methods of treatment to delay early menstruation and the prevention of a different consequence : premature ageing of bones , which can ultimately lead to the ultimate barrier to growth and hence the small growth of the body in adults .	-6.9600
The recommendations for medical or hormonal therapy are based on the age of the child , the speed of development , the rate of growth and emotional maturity .	-3.4675
Psychosocial aspects are also important .	-1.1491
Kaplowitz is hesitant about medicines , but he admits : “ The suppression of puberty can mitigate behavior problems and feelings of girls , unlike their age fossils . ”	-5.1977
The other major problem is understandable : parents simply do not want their very young daughters to have the period .	-1.9267

There are many comprehensively published theories about the causes of early puberty .	-1.6528
But there is no consistent evidence that hormones in milk or other food , chemicals in the environment , or sexual messages in the media would be cause .	-3.0613
Boys come into puberty in a similar way to girls earlier .	-3.4146
Kaplowitz believes that the most convincing premise is the epidemic of obesity .	-1.2945
He supported the conduct of a study in 2001 on girls aged six to nine , which establishes a link between body fat and puberty entry .	-3.5535
Other investigations support this conclusion , but there are many other factors that play a role .	-2.6162
In that country , African and Hispanic girls tend to reach puberty rather than their white colleagues .	-2.6251

Globally , early puberty seems to be influenced by all kinds of things , from economic conditions to climate to genes .	-2.4511

Jumbo manufacturers argue about seating width in the face of large orders .	-3.2401
There has been a debate between leading aircraft manufacturers about the width of tourist seats on long-haul flights , which indicates the tone for a bitter collision at Dubai Airshow this month .	-4.4097
The dispute revolves around the width of the seats offered to passengers on long flights in the tourist class – not always the ones who make the most effort by airlines , but this expelled space is the key to the efficiency assertions of the latest aircraft in Airbus SAS and Boeing Co .	-13.9551
This week , Airbus demanded an industry standard that requires a seat width of at least 46 cm ( 18 inches ) in the tourist class , but the US archrival Boeing says that airlines should decide .	-4.5593
The dispute comes at a time when aircraft manufacturers are competing to sell even larger versions of their twin-engine long-haul flyers and expect record flights at the event from 17 to 21 November .	-5.4769
As the rear part of the aircraft is designed – especially whether there are rows with nine or ten seats – it is crucial for the economic results indicated by the new mini-jumbo design .	-5.2361
Boeing claims that its modernized “ 777X ” comprises 406 people at seats in the tourist class that are more than 17 inches wide , allowing ten per row .	-11.9779
Airbus explains that the competing version of the A350 carries 350 people in 18 inches wide seats in the tourist class , with nine per row .	-3.9656
Aircraft giants often distribute hits about technical details using advertising in the specialist press .	-4.4071
Now Airbus is appealing to the public in front of the Dubai Airshow , where the 777X , with more than 100 orders , is expected to make the ra.	-10.6667
Recently , the company presented an ad that could be the beginning of a new advertising war , showing donors a picture in which three people are crossed in a restaurant , and the title : “ Would you accept that ? ”	-5.6441
“ Boeing proposes long-haul flights in seats that are tighter than regional turbo props , ” says Airbus Head of Sales John Leahy .	-3.1421
Given the changes in nutritional habits , people are getting thicker , but aircraft seats have not changed radic.	-4.0820
Between the early 1970s , when Boeing 747 defined modern long-range journey , and the end of the century , male average American weight increased by ten % between 40 and 49 years , the US Department of Health recorded .	-4.1179
According to US health statistics , the male average American in the 21st century is 100.8 cm .	-3.7206
Airbus says that its rival adheres to a 1950 ’ s seat concept , when the average body range of the freshly baptized “ Jet Set ” was narrower .	-4.5002
Airbus said that investigations were carried out that an additional customs ( 2.54 cm ) per seat increased sleep quality by 53 percent .	-3.8700
Boeing denies the figures from Airbus to the sitting dimensions and says that it is not the discretion of manufacturers to decide how airlines structure the balance between tariffs and equipment .	-5.1863
The company also explains , according to investigations , the aircraft experience depends on more than the seat width .	-3.8948
“ It really works to give airlines flexibility so that they can do what they think they need to be successful , ” explains Kent Craver von Boeing ’ s flight cabin expert . , , , and , . , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.0811

Behind the battle is a race for aircraft orders with an estimated volume of at least $ 700 billion after list prices in the coming decades , which could have a sustainable impact on US or European export balance .	-4.4234
As Reuters reported for the first time in July , the seat layout is the driving force behind the dispute over the new jets .	-9.2218
Both Airbus and Boeing claim 20 % more efficiency per seat in their latest twin-engine long-range designs than the market leader in this segment , the 365-seated Boeing 77-300ER .	-3.2350
Boeing ’ s statements on the results depend partly on the fact that the 777X is compared to the original design of nine seats in the 777 .	-3.9691
The increased cost per unit is still lower than the current machines with ten seats per series .	-3.4575
“ Boeing therefore qualifies more seats in its aircraft to make it more competitive to our products , ” says Kevin Keniston , Head of Passenger Convenience at European Airbus .	-4.0021
On the other hand , analysts , full cabins with ten seats per series on existing 77s suggested that many passengers chose closer arrangements , which could be accompanied by cheaper fares .	-4.7769
“ Eighteen customs seats would be good for passengers , but the reality is : from an economic point of view , the Airbus offer is controlled by the 777 threat , ” says Mary Kirby , expert on cabin setup , founder and publisher of Runway Girl Network .	-3.9900
Airbus and Boeing do not offer seats , but a catalogue of suppliers from which airlines can choose .	-2.9440
The global jet sellers even carry band dimensions to measure the facility at the competition .	-5.5573
Even if they offer comfort , all manufacturers also offer jets with highly compressed design for low-cost airlines and regional flights .	-4.0055
Airbus offers a ten-seated A350 , but has not sold it according to its own statement .	-3.7734
Until recently , Airbus stressed the importance of more adaptability of the cabins and offered wide seats on the corridors for some jets .	-3.9504
Without the support of the only other manufacturer of large modern jets , experts say that the call for a new industry standard could probably be plugged up , but could distract from the wave of 777X sales .	-4.2902
New anti-nicotine vaccine could give the pleasure of smoking a bargain .	-4.3616
Scientists have developed an anti-nicotine vaccine that could spoil the fun of smoking .	-1.8137
A single dose of the vaccine could protect mice from nicotine addiction for a lifetim. the is . in , , , , , , , , , ,	-9.8867
Prior to human testing , further tests are needed , which may take a few years , but Professor Ronald Crystal of Weill Cornell Medical College in New York said that the first results are good .	-4.1770
“ We are very hopeful that this kind of vaccination strategy can once help millions of smokers who have tried to stop trying out all the methods available on the market , but have experienced that their nicotine addiction is stronger than these approaches , ” Cornell said .	-4.1503
The new vaccine contains a harmless virus that has been changed to include genetic information on the production of nicotine antibodies .	-2.5590
The virus selectively infects the liver cells , which then produce a permanent current of antibodies .	-2.2288
The antibodies hunt the nicotine molecules in the blood and neutralize them before they reach the brain , leaving a smoker no nicotine high .	-3.2175
Vaccinated mice to which Nikotin was administered during trials maintained their normal level of activity .	-4.0278
Mouse without vaccination , by contrast , had taken a “ time out , ” the researchers declared that the nicotine had reached its brain .	-3.9526
The experiments are described in the Science Translational Medicine sheet .	-1.8132
Previous tobacco vaccines failed because they contained antibodies .	-1.4788
The vaccinations had to be so often given to maintain antibodies that they were expensive and impractical .	-3.6144
But the cost of the new vaccine is probably much lower , because it transforms liver cells into antibody factories .	-2.3485
As Professor Crystal said , a future vaccine for people , if it is quite certain , could be given to children before they were tempted to try a cigarette , thereby preventing nicotine addiction .	-4.0951
But it is more likely that smokers would use it to stop .	-1.5761
“ Then they know : when they start smoking again , they no longer feel enjoyed because of the nicotine vaccine , and that helps them to remove habit , ” he explains .	-5.7676
British scientists said that the results were interesting , but at the same time warned that further research was needed .	-2.4344
Tripodi denied being influenced by Obeid	-1.7461
State supervision of corruption is taking place against former ministers of the Laboratory Party , Joe Tripodi from New South Wales .	-3.8355
Former NSW minister denied having amended maritime packaging rules at the request of his political mentor , Eddie Obeid , who had covert participations in three plots in state-controlled country .	-5.2145
On Friday , the Independent Commission Against Corruption ( ICAC - Independent Commission against Corruption ) extended its investigations into whether Obeid influenced various ministers of state to extend pacht contracts at the Circular Quay , where the Obeds operated two restaurants and a café , without inviting them to tender in August 2005 .	-6.3804
Now it is determined because of the accusation that Tripodi was aware of Obeid ’ s hidden interest in the land after Tripodi ’ s former deputy chief of staff Lynne Ashpole said accordingly on Thursday .	-5.1071
In years of talks that began in 2005 , the government had pushed for public tenders for the pacht treaties .	-3.8006
They were opposed to it and also wanted longer running time .	-4.8542
In 2009 , the Circular Quay companies , which contributed $ 2.5 million annually to the obedience , were renewed without public tendering .	-5.0300
Tripodi , who was the port minister from February 2006 to November 2009 , was originally in favour of public procurement .	-3.3181
But he disputed having made the changes to Obeid ’ s request , who , as Tripodi confirmed , had pushed for a reorganisation of the government ’ s pache rules .	-5.8268
One of the ICAC ’ s telephone calls showed talks from August and September 2007 between Obeid , Tripodi , and Steve Dunn , a senior official who moved to the port ministry after working under Obeid in the fishing authority .	-4.7114
‘ Was the issue discussed in these telephone calls on the drafting of commercial packaging arrangements ? ’ , Commissioner Anthony Whealy Tripodi asked .	-4.3875
No , Tripodi replied .	-1.1244
I cannot remember what was discussed , but that was definitely not .	-2.1438
Certainly not between me and Mr Obeid .	-2.5185
Israeli combat aircraft attacks Syria ’ s target , so official sources of sources	-2.8259
Israeli hunting aircraft would have attacked Thursday night a target in Latakia 's Syrian port , confirmed a senior official to Fox News .	-3.7151
The official did not explain what the goal was , but said it was at least one .	-2.4589
According to Associated Press , the target was Russian SA-125 missiles .	-1.8661

Foreign workers with 457 visas could be “ tested in authority ”	-2.9104
The government is considering , within the framework of extended measures , a “ test of authority ” for foreign workers with 457 visas .	-3.7780
Should the test be introduced , it would be used through a criterion to prevent the 457 being used to fill unskilled jobs or as a back door for the family and friends to Australia .	-4.5699
Today , a proposal for a discussion by the government was published after former Laboratory MEPs , Maxine McKew , condemned the government ’ s comments on foreign workers , because they could be viewed as an insult by Australian neighbours . . , in , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-12.9640
“ Volute declarations such as that foreigners are supposed to backfire – and , Australians first cease – are a very unpleasant retreat at times when trade unions demanded a protected labor market , ” she said to the Australia India Institute today .	-11.6826
Historically , white labour should be protected – and if some in the region take a recipe for this historical artifact , I would not be surprised .	-5.1362
The proposal for a discussion outlines twelve measures that were once considered by former Minister of Immigration , Chris Bowen .	-3.8386
Immigration Minister Brendan O 'Connor , who was in talks yesterday about smuggling in Sri Lanka , implemented five of the recommended changes , and the others are still being considered .	-4.0690
If the “ criterion of authenticity ” is adopted , someone who applies for a visa could be verified as to whether “ the application is real in cases where the applicant is related or personally related to the owner or relevant person of the supporting company . ”	-5.1542
Companies could also be obliged to account for the number of 457 visa holders , after hundreds of companies who wanted to support only a small number of workers in the past .	-4.5375
Meanwhile , a 35-year-old Sri Lankan asylum seeker probably died at a heart attack after arriving this week with a refugee boat on the Christmas island .	-3.7375
The disturbed nine-year-old son of the man who came with him to Australia has been cared for since his father 's death on Wednesday by an adult cousin , who was also on the boat .	-4.3886
Australian authorities brought the man to the Christmas Island Hospital where he died .	-1.6134
The British Government has announced a study to increase the benefits of the HS2 railway project for Scotland .	-2.4866
HS2 Ltd 's work proposes realising high-speed connections between Scotland and the North of England as early as 2026 .	-3.4925
Transport Minister Baroness Kramer said that the project “ will bring the United Kingdom closer together . ”	-8.6251
Scottish Transport Minister Keith Brown said he was very pleased to work with the British Government on this plan .	-2.6282
Phase 1 consists of a new high-speed railway link between London and the West Midlands .	-1.8861
After Phase 2 , there will be connections to Manchester and Leeds .	-2.4732
In June , the government corrected the estimated cost of building the high-speed road between London and Northern England from <unk> 32.7 billion to <unk> 42.6 billion .	-2.6106
The British Government , which is talking to Transport Scotland , has commissioned HS2 Ltd to seek further route capacity and travel time improvements for Northern England and Scotland .	-4.3077
This includes the possibility of a trip from ultimately three hours or less from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London .	-2.9765
Baroness Kramer said : “ Our goal for HS2 is a truly national route network that brings Britain closer together and its cities . ”	-2.7745
We are proceeding with HS2 because it brings enormous benefits .	-2.4496
Without it we are facing a crisis of capacity on our rail network .	-2.7328
But it is also about the link between 18 British cities , including Glasgow and Edinburgh , which is improved thanks to HS2 .	-2.6919
The Scottish Secretary of State Alistair Carmichael said : “ Today ’ s announcement is good news for Scotland . ”	-2.1953
On behalf of the Scottish Government , Keith Brown Carmichael asked for “ unequivocal ” support for Scottish integration into the HS2 network .	-3.1298
Brown said : “ The high-speed railway link has the potential of enormous economic benefits for Scotland , but Scotland ’ s economic power also provides an argument for rapid rail connections across the United Kingdom . ”	-13.7634
We are therefore delighted to work as a partner of the British Government to examine the options for a high-speed rail link in Scotland , which will bring benefits for everyone and complement the Glasgow-Edinburgh link that the Scottish Government is already planning .	-4.9599
I look forward to looking at the investigation report with the British ministers next year and to jointly adopting the next steps .	-3.3641
Regulations on electronic equipment in aircraft are provisionally in force in Australia for the time being . in force in Auin Austr.	-13.6339
Australian aircraft passengers must continue to disable tablets and smartphones at start and landing , despite efforts in the US to relax the regulations for such devices .	-4.6510
The US Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) enables US airlines to change their targets so that passengers can read , view , or play videos on their devices during critical flight phases .	-15.2325
During most of the flight passengers are already allowed to do this , but many people find it annoying that they cannot read their e-books when starting and landing .	-4.1139
Australian companies , however , are not pursuing immediate plans to amend their regulations in order to implement them .	-4.4832
The CASA Air Control Agency also stated that it would be looked at the announcement , but stressed that the restrictions on the use of electronic equipment remain in critical flight phases in Australia .	-11.8840
“ CASA currently has no specific regulations on the use of electronic equipment in the aircraft , ” has been announced .	-3.7246
The subject is subject to provisions that airlines must maintain safety at any time and that passengers must comply with the safety instructions given by cabin crew .	-3.7552
Virgin has already held talks with the CASA on the extension of its Wi-Fi entertainment system to flights and said that it is open to change , but it should be initiated by the legislator .	-5.2470
“ We would welcome a review of the authorisation of electronic equipment by CASA , because we are convinced that this would improve customer experience after we now offer ( wireless entertainment ) during the flight , ” said a speaker .	-4.0374
Qantas explained that it will remain with current rules until further notice .	-3.6103
“ Our current guidelines stipulate that electronic equipment must not be used when starting and landing , and we do not currently have any plans to change that , ” said the company .	-12.9333
The FAA rules apply to US airlines .	-1.5811
However , we are always interested in developments in regulations that can benefit passengers and will certainly look closely at the FAA decision and the reasons behind it .	-3.6771
The decision varies from age to age in American societies .	-3.4320
They must prove that their aircraft can tolerate the radio disorders caused by mobile devices , and change manuals , training materials , hand baggage programs , and customer instruction .	-11.5895
“ After confirming the tolerance of its fleet , an airline can allow passengers to use portable , lighter electronic devices such as tablets , e-book readers and smartphones at any height , ” the FAA announced .	-4.0729
In rare cases , the crew will guide the passengers while landing the devices .	-4.8920
The group also recommended that heavier devices be stushed safely under the seat or in the subjects above the seats when starting and landing .	-4.6219
Before the Shakespeare Revierby vs. Schalke , BVB trailers had got luminous missiles for ugly scenes in the Veltins Arena .	-7.0425
Borussia Dortmund then announced harsh consequences .	-1.5820
Ultras reacted with silence before the Friday matin .	-4.2207
It was an unusual , almost spectacular acoustic that offered the viewer to the viewer until just before the launch of the Bundesliga game between the German vice champion Borussia Dortmund and the VfB Stuttgart in the Signal Iduna Park .	-5.1470
You can hear the guest fans with their songs .	-4.2320
The South Gallery opposed to where the most faithful - and loudest - BVB fans were standing at first exceptionally quiet : no songs , no battlegrounds .	-6.3503
The podium of the capo , which otherwise coordinates the joint action , remained unoccupied .	-3.3533
And at the front of the gallery a big flag inscribed " section prohibition " .	-4.7609
Only as Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller as the first BVB player to enter the place , burned up short-term cheering .	-5.0462
When his team colleagues followed , there was loud vocals and floating scarves - but not everywhere .	-4.2745
In the central blocks 12 and 13 of the South gallery , nothing emerged .	-4.0327
Also , that Stadium Speaker Norbert Dickel listed the positive experiences of the last few days - Derbysieg , Victory over Arsenal , the extension of the contract of Trainer Jürgen Klopp - did not provide for celebration .	-5.4618
Only five minutes before the crowd , the Capo clommed its podium - and the tension that until then straight with hands was discovered in a loud cry when thickness , as usual , asked the mood at the ranks in the stadium .	-9.2395
As always , the South Gallery was in the turn - and at last it was once again the loudest place in the stadium .	-5.7446
And at the latest when the South gallery hit the vocal call " Derbysiker is on " , everything was as always .	-6.5453
Previously , silence was a response to what has happened in recent days .	-2.7495
Immediately before the FC Schalke 04 , some of the BVB trailers had fired light missiles into the spectator ranks and on the square - meeting almost Torhüter Roman Weidenfeller .	-5.8745
The game was late created due to the chaotic scenes .	-10.6613
BVB-Boss Hans-Joachim Watzke had received the heads of Dortmund Ultras in his office - and one believes Watzke 's words , this was a rather unpleasant date for fan representatives .	-4.5982
" There will be massive cuts for the entire ultra movement , " the BVB Boss announced on Thursday evening at a panel discussion in Frankfurt .	-3.0614
As an immediate measure , Watzke prohibited the ultras from a choreography for the home game against VfB Stuttgart .	-3.5471
" I have banned this , " he explained .	-2.7441
We cannot abandon zero tolerance policy on pyrotechnics .	-1.8913
Furthermore , the Ultras have various possibilities of punishment - until Tuesday they now have time to decide on one .	-5.4229
Otherwise , Watzke said , the BVB will establish a sanction by the end of next week .	-2.5587
" This will be cutting " , insured Watzke .	-3.6999
It is worth seeing how the reactions in the South gallery are then .	-4.4835
Pfandhouses boom in Singapore , as the crisis has arrived in the middle class .	-2.6710
In a deposit house in the Bendemeer shopping centre in Singapore , Janani Amirthalinga exchanges a golden arm mature , a ring and a pair of earrings to pay for the school fees of its daughters .	-4.8961
“ My husband and I have just bought a house , there is all my money in it , ” says Amirthalinga .	-2.9054
Although she earns 3,000 Singapore dollars every month ( approximately EUR 1,730 ) as administrator and her husband also work , monthly family income is not enough , she explains .	-4.1403
Indeed , demand in parts of Southeast Asia – where household debt is increasing – is so great that ValueMax , where she has exchanged , became the third deposit house listed on the Singapore stock market this week .	-3.5233
Putting jewellery is not only a quick way to get money – $ 1,300 in the case of Janani Amirthalinga – but also almost as cheap as an unsecured bank loan .	-3.2283
Typically , Singapore Pfandhouses require an effective annual rate of 17 % , just above the 15.4 % that the United Overseas Bank demands , a local creditor with a branch in the same shopping center .	-4.2282
Pfandhouses , however , offer the advantage that there is no need to review creditworthiness or income evidence , which is why loans are faster than in banks .	-5.2632
That is why millions of people in the region turn to deposit houses , as families feel the pressure from rising living costs and increasing household and consumer debt .	-4.0268
After five years of robust growth since the global financial crisis , and loan credit , owing to easier fiscal policies in developed economies , families with lower and middle-income deposit houses are seeking to compensate for the difference in fatal economies .	-5.2473
This week , the rating agency Standard & Poor 's growing budget debt , mainly through rising mortgages , was a risk factor for Asian banks ’ creditworthiness .	-3.3312
Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore , according to the Agency 's assessment , have the highest budget debt in Asia relative to GDP .	-3.4987
Malaysia , at 80 % of GDP , is at the top of the list , an increase of 60 % in 2008 .	-2.7283
Economists are also worried about the high level of consumer debt in Thailand , which emerged almost from a technical recession this week .	-2.9724
On Thursday , the data showed continued export weakness and a reduction in consumer demand .	-3.1560
“ In effect , this means that , given rising costs , the middle to lower segments ( the income scale ) will try to supplement their income wherever possible , ” says Song Seng Wun , economist at CIMB , a Malaysian bank .	-4.0297
Historical maximum gold prices over the past two years have reinforced the trend to pledge personal objects , as people are taking the opportunity to turn the family 's jewelry into cash .	-5.3904
In Singapore , about 70 % of the pledged objects are gold in the 200 deposit houses of the city state .	-3.9902
People say , “ The price of gold looks good , let us pledge grandmother ’ s gold chain and return next month . ”	-3.3296
The largest Thai deposit house operator , EasyMoney , has seen a 20 % increase in customers in recent months .	-3.2521
Growth in deposit business is so strong that ValueMax , operator of the branch in Bendemeer and 15 others in Singapore want to expand not only to neighbouring Malaysia – where the company operates four houses – but also outside Asia , says Yeah Lee Ching , Managing Director of ValueMax .	-4.1959
The company finances this at 60 % of the 66 million Singapore dollars that it received this week with the Singapore stock market .	-4.5414
While some lenders have gone into the crusade due to high interest rates , Yeah explains that deposit houses not only offer cheaper interest rates than other lenders , but also do not directly increase debt .	-5.3361
“ Customers lend items they already own , and the liquefied personal valuables do not increase household debt , ” she explains .	-4.2783
The deposit business is increasingly accepted as short-term , secure financing .	-3.6361
Nor are all the people using deposit bonds in financial difficulties .	-2.6660
Rich people from Singapore also come to ValueMax branches to pledge gold bars and Rolex watches , for which they receive up to 60 % of the purchase price in cash .	-3.2906
We have customers from every social class .	-2.6064
“ These include wealthy people who borrow something for a business or investment in the short term , or small businesses that have to bridge bottlenecks in the cash flow , ” says Yeah .	-3.7531

Rescue package of 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian health care	-2.5182
The Australian government insists on the hard conditions linked to the rescue package of more than 325 million Australian dollars for Tasmanian healthcare to ensure that the federal government cannot waste the money .	-3.4312
Federal Health Minister Tanya Plibersek has announced that the Commonwealth will take “ immediate measures ” to avert a crisis caused by an ageing population of the island state , a higher rate of chronic diseases and system restrictions .	-3.2899
Four years later , financing was decided by Andrew Wilkie , an independent Tasmanian member .	-4.3322
“ The government has launched an emergency rescue package that , in our view , addresses the unique challenges facing the federal state , ” explained Plibersek today .	-3.8286
The $ 325 million package includes $ 31 million emergency aid for electoral services .	-2.8751
Further 2600 operations , including orthopedic intervention and grey star treatment , are intended to eliminate residues .	-3.8857
There is also money for daily hospitals in Hobart and Launceston , better care for stationary stays , specialist training , mental health services and the introduction of a system for electronic recording of health data in local hospitals .	-4.4008
“ These investments correspond to the ideas that affected me by clinic workers said to me that they are the best way to improve the Tasmanian health system , ” said Tanya Plibersek .	-4.3314
The Minister insisted on the Tasmanian Government 's strict reporting and accountability .	-2.2888
The federal state must retain the current level of financing in order to receive money from the Commonwealth , and report monthly on where the extra money was spent .	-4.0812
A three-headed Commission will be set up and will ensure that the federal state provides health services as effectively and efficiently as possible .	-3.1153
As Wilkie explained today , the $ 325 million would benefit little if “ they were not accompanied by real reforms that put the Tasmanian public health system on a more sustainable path . ”	-3.7716
Nevertheless , he praised the government for responding to his request for urgent help , which he first expressed to the Prime Minister in early May .	-10.7174
“ I am confident that federal aid will make a major contribution to removing the state ’ s public health system from the care list , ” said Wilkie .	-3.1581
According to the federal government , these electoral performances will largely compensate for the recent cuts .	-10.6825
But the opposition ’ s health-care spokesman , Peter Dutton , believes that today ’ s announcement is just a “ paving solution . ”	-3.3024
“ We are in today ’ s situation because the laboratory government has withdrawn $ 430 million from the healthcare system , ” he said to ABC TV .	-3.0935
It is unacceptable for a state government to withdraw almost half a billion dollars from the system and to incur the Commonwealth 300 million and then act as if the good news .	-5.4584
Dutton called on Plibersek to guarantee that not a single dollar of the rescue package would be spent on additional bureaucracy .	-2.9581

Syria has destroyed its ability to manufacture chemical weapons , such as a surveillance group .	-2.8367
Syria has destroyed important chemical weapons and gas ammunition facilities , the Global Chemical Weapons Monitoring Group declared on Thursday , while serious clashes have occurred in the north of the country near one of the sites suspected of toxic substances being stored .	-5.3641
Also on Thursday , a Syrian activist group announced that more than 120,000 people have been killed since the start of civil war three years ago .	-3.7112
The announcement of the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ( OPCW ) came on the day before the deadline .	-3.2876
November 1 , the organization Damascus , based in The Hague , had set up to destroy all the chemical weapons manufacturing facilities or to “ inoperate , ” including all the machines for mixing chemicals into toxic gas and filling ammunition .	-4.8886
The conclusion of this process , which is basically the first stage of destruction , is an important milestone in an ambitious timetable aimed at destroying all chemical weapons in Syria by mid-2014 .	-3.0798
Destroying institutions means that Syria can no longer produce new chemical weapons .	-1.8414
However , Damascus must begin to destroy the existing weapons and stocks .	-9.2126
According to assumptions , there are about 1,000 tonnes of chemicals and weapons in the country , including senfgas and Sarin ’ s nerve gas .	-3.1938
The announcement came from the experts at a time when fighting in the city of Safira took place on Thursday that there was a production facility for chemical weapons and warehouses , as the Syrian observatory for human rights , which was based in the United Kingdom .	-5.2804
On Thursday , the group of activists pursuing the number of deaths over a network of activists in Syria declared that 120,296 people died .	-11.9065
Of these , 61,067 are civilians , including 6,365 children .	-1.7870
On the part of the government , 29,954 of them belonged to the army of President Bashar Assad , 18,678 were pro-government fighters and 187 Lebanese Hezbollah militias .	-3.1356
Also among the dead were army soldiers deserted 2,202 and 5,375 opposition fighters , many of them foreigners .	-2.4822
On 25 July , the UN estimated the number of deaths in this conflict since March 2011 to 100,000 .	-1.9279
This number has not been updated .	-1.3956
The conflict has forced some two million people to escape the country .	-7.7498
Assad ’ s troops have been fighting in Safira for weeks against the rebels , many of whom have links with al-Qaeda groups .	-2.7841
The monitoring centre said that there were losses on both sides on Thursday , but there were no details .	-3.1868
The fighting underscores the danger facing the chemical weapons inspectors , because their mission to liberate Syria from its toxic arsenal is a race against the time in the midst of a raging civil war .	-4.3543
According to the OPCW , which is working closely with the United Nations , the team is “ now convinced that it has seen and experienced its destruction all important production and filling facilities mentioned by Syria . ”	-4.2145
Therefore , “ no more inspection activities are planned at the moment . ”	-2.5698
Earlier this week , the inspectors explained that they had completed the first round of checks and visited 21 out of 23 of the sites indicated by Damascus .	-3.1519
Due to security concerns , the visit of two institutions was not possible , the inspectors said .	-3.1160
On Thursday , OPWC explained that , according to Syria , the two sites had been abandoned and that the Chemical Weapons Programme objects there were moved to other facilities mentioned that were inspected . ”	-5.1976
It was not immediately clear whether the site in Safira was one of the two institutions that could not visit the OPCW inspectors .	-2.9704
Syria has presented a plan to completely destroy its chemical weapons , which will have to be approved by the OPWC executive committee next month .	-11.7313
“ I salute the hat of bravery and the courage that you have shown all in meeting the most challenging mission ever carried out by this organization , ” said Ahmed Uzumcu , the Director-General of the Supervisory Organization in a comment published by OPCW .	-10.5385

Wrath over verdict on Bali ’ s Bomb LBBBBB. BBBBBB	-9.7269
Survivors and relatives of the 202 people who died in the Bali bombing in 2002 reacted angry at the judgment of the last of the offenders brought to justice , as Umar Patek , in her opinion , should be shot by standard law . the . was in . , , , , , , , , ,	-12.1230
Patek , who was fleeing almost ten years as one of the most sought persons in Southeast Asia , was condemned yesterday for his role in building explosives for the bomb attack to a sentence of 20 years .	-4.6247
With punishment , he could be dismissed after 15 years .	-3.5522
The 45-year-old was guilty of mass murder due to the attack on two night clubs in the popular tourist area of Kuta , where 202 people died , including 88 Australians , and many others were injured .	-3.4803
A debt was also made in a series of terrorism-related charges , including a wave of explosive attacks on churches in Indonesia on Holy Eve in 2000 .	-3.8920
The Public Prosecutor had demanded a lifelong imprisonment , even if she could have applied for the man who , because of his reputation as a master bomb builder , was also called a “ demolition man . ”	-5.7642
The decision has raised painful memories at June Corteen , a mother from Perth who lost her 39-year-old twin daughters Jane and Jenny in the devastation caused by Patek and his co-spoilers almost ten years ago .	-4.0025
Fighting with tears , she said that Patek should have been sentenced to death .	-2.2179
I really think he should follow in the footsteps of the other guy .	-1.9195
“ You should put him before a shooting command , ” Corteen said to AAP .	-2.6457
I have to live every day that I will not get another grandson and I will never see my daughters any more .	-3.7792
The Sari Club was equated to the ground when , on October 12 , 2002 , a huge bomb exploded in a small load that was parked in front of the night club .	-12.9668
Peter Hughes was in Paddy 's Bar , where only 20 seconds earlier a suicide bomber had an explosive backpack filled with explosive .	-3.0420
After the attack , he fell into coma for one month and “ died ” three times as he went to a life-maintenance system .	-4.0575
Hughes said that Patek deserved the same fate as the three other members of the terrorist cell Jemah Islamiah – Amrozi , Mukhlas , and Imam Samudra – who were responsible for the bloodbath and executed four years ago .	-2.4813
Indeed , this type should have the death penalty above all else .	-2.8957
Leaving him alive – no , there is no reason to keep him alive .	-2.5783
Getting 20 years after killing 202 people and injuring many hundreds is not much .	-2.6045
Patek is the last of the Bali bomber to be tried .	-1.9185
He escaped nearly a decade of arrest , but was eventually taken up in the Pakistani city of Abbottabad in January 2011 , where US forces killed former Osama bin Laden al-Qaeda chief .	-3.9489
During the negotiation , an FBI agent said that intelligence reports had pointed out that Patek was in Pakistan to meet bin Laden with the aim of rebuilding the link between Southeast Asian terrorist groups and al-Qaeda .	-3.4672
“ He did not stand up , ” said Corteen .	-3.0196
Until recently , he showed no repentance for how much suffering he dealt with other people .	-3.1038
The judgment passed before the ten-year anniversary of the attack this year , which is being celebrated in Bali and Australia .	-3.4150
“ There will be many tears this year , ” said Corteen .	-1.5450
Patek may appeal against his verdict .	-1.9032
FAA : Passengers can now use electronic devices in aircraft ( but do not conduct mobile phone calls )	-3.2035
Air travellers can now listen to their electronic devices for reading , working , playing , music and using the reputation of movies , but not by phone , so the new guidelines published on Thursday by the Federal Aviation Administration ( FAA ) in the USA .	-5.5935
But passengers should not expect these changes to be implemented immediately .	-1.7670
How quickly they would be implemented depending on the airline concerned , FAA employee Michael Huerta explained at a press conference .	-3.3866
Airlines must demonstrate to the FAA that aircraft comply with the new directives and that they have updated the training manuals of aircraft staff and the regulations for installation in accordance with the new regulations .	-5.3500
The FAA has stated that it has already received plans from some airlines to expand the use of portable electronic equipment in aircraft .	-3.2659
Delta and JetBlue were also among these airlines .	-1.8439
“ Depending on the state of the plan , we could approve the expanded use of electronic equipment very soon , ” the FAA announced a notice .	-11.5731
Currently passengers need to turn off smartphones , tablets and other equipment when the aircraft doors are closed .	-3.0039
They are only allowed to restart when the plane reaches a height of three kilometres and the captain gives the green light .	-4.3787
When entering the country , passengers must shut them off and must not restart them before the aircraft has reached the .	-6.0175
According to the new guidelines , airlines whose aircraft are secured against electronic disruptions could allow their passengers to use the devices even when starting , landing and rolling field , the FAA explained .	-4.9398
Most new traffic aircraft and other aircraft that have been converted to larger heights for the use of Wi-Fi should meet the criteria .	-4.7967
Laura Glading , president of professional flight companion , welcomed the changes .	-2.4931
“ If the new regulation is certainly implemented – and we work closely with the airline in this respect – both sides will benefit , ” said Glading .	-4.0581
To be honest , we are sorry to feel like care about this issue .	-4.5011
However , Internet connections to surfing , exchanging e-mails , text messages or downloading data under three kilometres remained banned , the Authority explained .	-3.3742
Passengers are invited to put smartphones , tablets and other devices into flight mode .	-2.8619
So no “ Words With Friends ” , the scrabble similar online game that the actor Alec Baldwin played on his smartphone in 2011 , when he had to leave a jet of American Airlines in public effect because he refused to switch off the device while the aircraft was parked on the flight .	-4.9747
And heavier devices such as laptops must continue to be staggered , because there is a risk of injury if they fly through the cabin .	-3.9268
Mobile calls during the flight remain banned as well .	-1.9275
The regulatory competence for telephone calls lies with the Federal Communications Commission ( FCC ) , not with the FAA .	-2.8592
FAA may lift prohibitions on certain electronic equipment when starting and landing .	-3.4799
Last month , Mark Rosenker said by the National Transport Safety Board , Security Expert for National Transport on CBS News , that mobile phones would still be considered a risk .	-4.0617
“ Mobile phones are really a problem , not only because they could potentially cause problems with navigation devices , but because we know from the FCC that transmission from the air can also disrupt transmitters ” , Rosenker said .	-5.0563
A consultative committee of the industry , launched by the FAA to investigate this issue , recommended last month that the government allow more widespread use of personal electronic equipment .	-4.4364
In recent years , pressure on the FAA has increased to relax restrictions on use .	-1.9162
Critics like the Democratic Senator Claire McCaskill from Missouri take the view that there are no valid safety reasons for the ban .	-3.1148
The restrictions are also increasingly difficult to enforce , because the use of the equipment has become omnipresent .	-3.6474
In some studies there is talk of forgetting or ignoring the disabling of the device up to a third of the pass. the is . in , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-13.1899
In 1966 , the FAA began to restrict the use of electronic equipment by passengers after reports of disruptions of navigation and communication equipment had become known by passenger-led UKW radios , which were then the latest technical trend .	-5.3409
New aircraft are much more dependent on electrical systems than previous generations of aircraft , but they are also constructed in such a way that the FAA authorises them not to make up for electronic interferences .	-3.9059
Airlines have been providing passengers with wi-fi for some years when the flight is reached .	-5.0086
The aircraft adapted to Wi-Fi systems are also more unsensitive to interferences .	-3.0055
The vast majority of passenger aircraft should be suitable for the greater use of electronic equipment according to the new directives , said Huerta .	-10.5705
Today ’ s electronic equipment generally produces much less radiation than previous generations .	-2.8340
E-readers , for example , only give off minimal radiation when sheets .	-4.1147
But when downloading or sending data , transmission values are stronger .	-2.1766
Amazon.com is one of the advocates of easing the restrictions on the use of devices by passengers .	-3.8415
In 2011 , corporate employees invited a passenger aircraft full of Kindle e-reader and made a test flight to identify problems but could not find any .	-4.3820
Members of the FAA consultancy committee expressed mixed feelings about the risk of using equipment .	-2.4844
Douglas Kidd of the Passenger Association National Association of Airline Passengers said that he believes that the disruption of the devices is real , even if the risk is minimal .	-3.7232
Other committee members have said that there are only separate reports of pilots who speak for disruption of aircraft systems through the equipment , and most of them are very old .	-4.5115
However , the Committee recommended that the FAA allow pilots to arrange the disabling of the devices by passengers in the event of instrument landing under poor visibility .	-6.0368
A travel group welcomed the changes and described them as a reasonable adjustment for travellers , who would today be extensively equipped with technology . the of in the . , in the , in , , in , , , , was in . in	-17.2804
“ We are pleased that the FAA recognizes that a pleasant passenger experience is not at odds with security , ” said Roger Dow , CEO of the U.S. Travel Association .	-10.0948

Is Europe ’ s elite ready to do business with Great Britain ?	-8.5231
Business for Britain was launched in April with the intention of bringing the economy together and defining what those in the UK seek to change our relations with the EU .	-3.2255
To this end , we commissioned the largest and most comprehensive survey among British economic leaders and asked them what they think about Britain , the economy and the EU .	-2.9158
YouGov interviewed more than 1,000 business leaders who represent about Britain ’ s sizes , sectors , and regions .	-4.6031
The results of the survey will surprise many .	-1.7850
We have found that the vast majority of businesses are now exporting outside Europe and focusing on countries that modernise and grow while states in the EU are stagnating .	-3.3947
They want new trade ties with countries such as China , India , and Brazil to be favoured from the government side , rather than stopping the long and hard process of reforming the obscure EU institutions .	-4.3958
In their view , the majority of business leaders believe that control over these key competences should be returned to Westminster , in accordance with the legislation governing certain issues – from ticket law to product legislation .	-8.1922
There was general dissatisfaction with the internal market , because , according to companies , the costs of Brussels ’ rules would now outweigh the benefits of being part of Europe ’ s trade area – even 40 % of large companies agreed to that that that traditionally most pro-European .	-5.3990
Finally , and presumably the most , our survey by economic leaders showed that a clear majority of Britain wants a course of change in the agreement and a relationship with the EU based on trade is not political .	-6.1391
This realization , which is found by companies of all sizes and leaders , shows that the economy is pushing for a “ meaningful change ” that will bring the boost of action back to the United Kingdom .	-6.0204
Much is at stake – a change to the agreement and better conditions for Britain would lead to a referendum change of opinion in favour of remaining in the EU .	-4.4066
The Prime Minister should have no doubt : this survey shows that the British economy is behind his plan to renegotiate British conditions for EU membership .	-2.7362
It also shows that companies expect to see a significant shift in power relations back to the UK from renegotiation .	-3.1693
A better deal for the British economy is possible , and increasingly necessary , as the eurozone moves toward a closer economic and fiscal union .	-13.1542
The priority must be jobs and growth in the United Kingdom , as the result of our survey shows , which means greater attention for businesses to trade and a fundamental change in the Brussels approach to regulation .	-3.9421
Alexei Miller of Gazprom , the pipeline in Bulgaria , is the beginning of a new gasea .	-3.6414
The start of the South Stream pipeline in Bulgaria represents the launch of one of the largest European energy projects , explained by the Gazprom Board .	-3.7148
“ Today ’ s event is a milestone : building work on the Bulgarian section of the South Stream gas pipeline , the largest and most important project in Europe , has begun , ” said the Chairman of the Executive Board of Gazprom , Alexei Miller , in a statement on Thursday .	-3.2743
The project is a key element in the energy security of the entire European continent .	-2.2268
South Stream is supposed to increase the diversity of Russia ’ s export routes across Europe .	-2.9218
A treaty dispute between Gazprom and its counterparts in Ukraine , where the majority of Russian gas is stored for Europe , increases the risk of conventional routes , as is official .	-3.8828
Miller said that the direct link to Bulgaria , a member of the European Union , means that the geopolitical risks associated with transit countries are “ forever . ”	-3.2408
Bulgarian consumers receive gas from South Stream at lower rates when the entire project starts in 2015 .	-3.0612
According to Gazprom , construction work in other subordinate countries will start on the planned route at the end of the year .	-2.7915
The pipeline is designed for an annual capacity of 62.3 billion cubic metres of natural gas .	-1.9219

Hearing before the Royal Commission : Two YMCA staff charged with accusations against Jonathan Lord for sex offences	-3.2342
Two YMCA employees from New South Wales ( NSW ) were indicted for sex offences in relation to children before 2011 allegations were made against the child carer Jonathan Lord from Caringbah , as the Royal Commission for the sexual abuse of children learnt .	-13.3336
However , in the opening statement before the Commission , the YMCA stated that “ the organisation never had to deal with an incident of sexual child abuse ” .	-4.3313
Managing Director Phillip Hare was consulted about a case in which a YMCA staff had been accused of infringement of child pornography , and another in which a sports teacher of the YMCA Caringbah Hall in 1991 was sentenced for the abuse of familiar children .	-5.4615
Hare said Gail Furness , one of the Commission ’ s assisting lawyers , that he knew of the first case but did not know the second .	-2.9605
He acknowledged that the YMCA ’ s opening statement to the Commission was also inaccurate in the claim that ‘ there have been external reviews of the YMCA , which recognised the YMCA as the front front line in child safety ’ . in the of . , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.4756
Evidence before the Commission shows that the YMCA was informed that it received the second-lowest assessment of four possible in a quality audit of the Department of Education and Communities ( Ministry of Education ) in August of this year .	-3.6591
Hare , who started with 21 at the YMCA , admitted that the management had failed “ from me to downward ” in recruitment of Lord and did not ensure that employees were aware of their obligations to report breaches of child safety guidelines . in , , , , , , was , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-15.7759
Lord was sentenced at the beginning of the year for sexual offences to twelve boys during his two-year activity for the YMCA . in . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-11.1306
He has been sentenced to at least six years in prison .	-1.3319
But Hare disputed that the YMCA would have a cultural problem that prevented employees from reporting Lord ’ s infringements of children ’ s safety .	-4.1885
The staff said that they had watched infringements , including that Lord was with children alone , that she was caring for her as a babysitter , she was sitting on his lap , saying that he loved it , and that children were playing with his mobile phone .	-6.8835
Danielle Ockwell , whose chief Lord had asked for a training for child protection because she was concerned about his behaviour , said that the Child Service Manager Jacqui Barnat , who was Lords ’ superior in the YMCA Caringbah , was “ very intimidating and , most of all , very unnervous . ”	-6.0356
The Managing Director explained that he would not accept statements from employees that they would not have been incapable of reporting to their superior . .	-12.6338
Instead , he said , her friendship with Lord has affected her judgment , which is why they would not have reported him .	-4.0004
Hare stated that he told the Board of the YMCA NSW that the lesson that the organization has to learn from the “ Jonathan Lord incident ” concerns “ not the reporting ” by employees , and the Board agreed to it .	-5.4254
Hare said that the decision to urge employees to sign secrecy obligations was made shortly after the accusations occurred , by the managing director of the YMCA , Liam Whitley .	-4.3073
He said that the evidence should be prevented from being contaminated , but that was “ over-hasty ” and poorly implemented .	-4.1994
The YMCA NSW , when Jonathan Lord was working there between 2009 and 2011 , was not a safe organisation for children , said Professor Stephen Smallbone of Griffith University , expert on sexual child abuse , the Commission .	-3.7715

Tony Blair said he would seize the opportunity to return as British Prime Minister – but admits that comeback is unlikely .	-2.6146
In an interview this evening on the occasion of the fifth anniversary of his departure from office , the 59-year-old announced his views on various domestic issues .	-3.2651
Since his resignation in June 2007 after a decade as Head of State , Blair has largely avoided speaking on British politics , and his comments have mostly been limited to foreign policy and its role as a messenger of the Quartet of Middle East peacemakers .	-9.5411
When asked whether he would like to return to the Prime Minister ’ s office , Blair was quoted in the words of the Evening Standard from London : “ Yes , sure , but it is unlikely that this will happen , so ... ”	-4.0469
When the horse show experts found themselves in Cardiff to fuel the horse of the year , they realised that a hard competitive battle was in front of them .	-5.9208
No one was prepared for the three years old Fenton Kirkland .	-2.6752
The Knirps , who is not even in the kindergarten and did his first steps only a few months ago , and his Shetland Pony Toffee went easier through the three rounds and won the first prize – 30 adult opponents left behind .	-5.6350
The indivisible couple , both equally large , were praised for their performance , behavior and style in the annual competition organized by the Sunnybank Equestrian Centre in Rudry near Cardiff .	-3.9694
During his appearance in competition with men and women with elegant melons , he had set his plate cap in a cheeky corner and led the two years old toffee through the ring .	-5.8854
Fenton was praised by the jurors for his natural skills in dealing with the pony , which lay far above his age .	-3.0005
And Toffee received best notes for his performance and personality .	-2.5000
Fenton had been given Toffee as a gift to his third birthday last March and since then had been practising with the Shetland pony every day .	-12.9686
His mother , Donna , 30 , said , “ Fenton and Toffee are a great strain . ”	-2.5053
They had to enter the entire field and went out with gold pokal and rosette .	-5.6067
It was only the second time that he took part in a competition with Toffee , and we were all enthusiastic when he won .	-2.9680
Fully strangers in the arena thought it was so phenomenal that they wanted to be photographed with it .	-2.7561
The little boy from the village of Nantyglo near Ebbv Vale , South Wales , follows in the footsteps of his Tante Sharon Howell , who has been showing horses for over ten years .	-4.3136
Howells told , “ The whole audience was like electrified , and everyone bought him and applauded him . ”	-5.8355
He ran on the sand the entire length of the arena and although he looked so tiny , he did fantastic work .	-10.9056
Fenton is crazy for animals – he loves horses , tractors and farms and has two chickens he cares about .	-3.0549
As he has launched , it will not take long before he is on the “ horse of the year ” show – and I am sure he will perform well .	-4.2870
A spokesman of the annual horse show said : “ Fenton is only three , but he knows how to deal with his pony . ”	-2.6431
Together they are a great team .	-1.2275
The jurors rated Fenton and Toffee after how well they beat and presented themselves in the demonstration ring .	-4.0078
They pay attention to good cooperation between pony and guide – and Fenton and Toffee were the best in the ring .	-3.7326
I am sure that Fenton ’ s sweet clothing has contributed to this , which fits perfectly to the occasion .	-4.1487
The Chinese newspaper is to be “ reformed ” after the call for “ reform ”	-3.8834
A Chinese newspaper calling for the release of a report accused of defamation on the front page should be reformed , a press regulator explained .	-3.6062
The New Express , based in Guangzhou , had printed a rare public call to release the journalist Chen Yongzhou .	-2.5633
But Chen later admitted on television that he had accepted bribes to falsify reports of a partial firm .	-15.5178
Now , the New Express is subjected to “ comprehensive rectification , ” the regulatory authority explained .	-3.6292
The “ Rectification Order ” came from the Authority for Press and Publications , Radio , Film and Television in Guangdong .	-3.1480
Preliminary investigations showed that between September 2012 and August 2013 , the New Express , which is part of the Yangcheng Evening News Group , had published several inappropriate reports on the listed company Zoomlion .	-3.0334
“ The New Express editorial management was disordered , ” the regulatory authority announced in a statement .	-2.8951
She said it was decided to “ impose an administrative penalty for Chen Yongzhou and withdraw his reporting license . ”	-3.7056
Moreover , “ the Yangcheng Evening News Group has been instructed to carry out a complete rectification of the New Express and recommended that the relevant responsible at the New Express be identified and immediately reviewed the New Express management team . ”	-5.3622
Chen had written several articles for the New Express in which he reported about alleged financial irregularities with a manufacturer of construction machines called Zoomlion .	-3.2307
Having been arrested , the newspaper published two calls for his release on the front page and behind his journalistic work .	-2.9212
But then Chen came up on state television and admitted that he published false reports against payment .	-3.1590
“ In this case , I have damaged Zoomlion as well as the entire news industry and its ability to gain public confidence , ” he said to the state news agent CCTV .	-4.2993
I did so primarily because I was looking for money and fame .	-2.6327
It has become clear to me that I have acted wrongly .	-2.5091
Following Chen ’ s apology , the Neue Express published an apology on the front page and declared that it failed to properly check the reports .	-3.9977
Various well-known suspects have recently made confessions on television .	-2.6612
Experts say that confessions are still routinely forced , despite a legislative amendment at the beginning of the year , which prohibited the authorities from forcing someone to accuse themselves .	-3.5871
Drug tunnels with their own railways between the USA and Mexico are discovered .	-3.2504
One of the most sophisticated tunnels for drug smuggling between the USA and Mexico , fully equipped with lighting , ventilation , and electrical railway operation , has now been discovered .	-3.3989
The US authorities described the 120 times 90 centimetres tunnel as one of the most sophisticated passages they would ever have found .	-2.4479
The tunnel , which runs in the Zickzack pattern over a length of just under six football fields , connects warehouses near Tijuana , Mexico , and San Diego , USA .	-3.6890
There are countless inconspicuous warehouses in the area , which makes it easier to hide trucks charged with drugs .	-11.7126
The tunnel was closed before drugs could be transported unrecognized , the authorities explained .	-2.9758
In the discovery of the tunnel , eighteen and a half tonnes of Marijuana and 148 kilograms of cocaine were guaranteed , according to the records of the court .	-3.7301
Three men who worked as drivers according to the authorities were accused of owning and selling Marijuana and cocaine intended .	-3.9490
They are threatened with a debt sentence between ten years and lifetime .	-3.3421
In Nogales , Arizona , smugglers rely on an extensive underground network of dewatering channels .	-2.1962
The tunnel is the eighth big passage discovered in San Diego since 2006 .	-1.9542
Some of the biggest tunnels were discovered in Central Mexico following the Marijuana harvest in October , which poses the challenge of the drug cartels as they can quickly bring their product to consumers .	-4.6950
In 2010 , the authorities found a nearly 640 metre long passage with rails , which ran from a kitchen in a residential house in Tijuana to two warehouses in San Diego .	-4.0544
Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr still love Orlando Bloom and Miranda Kerr .	-1.4487
Actors Orlando Bloom and Model Miranda Kerr want to go separate ways in the future .	-2.5008
In an interview , however , Bloom said that he and Kerr still love .	-1.4658
Miranda Kerr and Orlando Bloom are parents of the two-year Flynn .	-1.6626
Actors Orlando Bloom spoke about the separation of his wife , Topmodel Miranda Kerr .	-2.7258
In an interview with US journalist Katie Couric , who was to be broadcast on Friday ( local time ) , Bloom said , " life sometimes is not exactly the way we plan or hope " .	-3.7056
Kerr and he loved himself still , stressed the 36-year-old .	-2.4950
" We will support each other and love Flynn parents .	-2.2231
Kerr and Bloom have been married since 2010 , their son Flynn was born in 2011 .	-2.3524
Veganism , according to Lexica , is subordinated to vegetarianism , but differs considerably from it .	-3.7242
Because while vegetarians permit the consumption of cream tortes , ice or a powerful edamer , these muddles are not on the menu of a vegan .	-5.6876
Milk , cheese , eggs , besides the abandonment of meat and fish , the vegan leaves off all consumption of animal products - also honey is denied .	-4.4904
Whatever remains , one might wonder , the vegan food world is characterized by a remarkable ingenuity .	-5.0372
" Brotation spreads are very popular " , explains Ute Henkelmann , the owner of the local reform house , providing a variety of special products for vegans .	-4.5030
Also Reuben Proctor is happy to visit the store in the Domgasse .	-3.2664
For 13 years , the native New Zealander vegan has lived , in Lampertheim he ( almost ) finds everything he needs to live . " In 1997 , my diet and became vegetarian .	-5.4309
At the turn of the century , the next step was taken and I became Veganer .	-2.2729
" The conviction came not only because of the diet but because of the choice of shoe " , says Proctor , who prefers leather normal leather .	-4.2026
He recognized that there is no animal products in other day-to-day matters . in , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-10.0119
First and foremost , vegan is an ethics .	-2.1636
" I do not want animals to die for me , " says Proctor the maxim of vegans that covers all consumption behavior .	-3.1152
Instead of mourning burgers , stirrers or rubber bears , the vegan quickly discovered completely new products , and enthusiasm grew .	-4.7145
" It is a double bonus " , says Proctor today , " In fact , " vegan is not a waiver , not an askee , but an enrichment " .	-6.0602
It is precisely these conditions that have led to a failure of some of the well-intentioned attempts .	-5.0764
" The addiction factor is a very crucial factor that leaves many to abandon quickly , similar to that of smoking , " sets a comparison .	-12.3520
And adds : ' Certain tastes are not to be fixed on the animal ' .	-4.4443
Often it is the spices or the type of preparation that make up the taste .	-3.1298
" You can also create the same effect in other ways , " illustrates the vegan .	-3.6010
For example , Proctor brings aubergines , champignons and also some vegan sausages to a barbecue .	-4.6065
It pays attention to a balanced , varied diet , and it should taste a lot of taste .	-6.4436
Of course you want to have something between the teeth , that is legitimate .	-2.5892
" It should taste , but it is not just to reduce it to animal food " , says Proctor .	-3.4304
Health damage to eating disorders , another widespread assumption , has not suffered .	-2.5703
For me , the change has had a positive aspect .	-2.4420
I do not take up a foreign cholester and have an increase in vitamin .	-4.3521
There are high-performance athletes who only feed vegan .	-1.9320
" My blood values are excellent , I often check me " , gives Proctor .	-3.9872
Many vegansimus critics warn of the lack of vitamin B12 in particular .	-2.1628
" As animals are nutritioned with feed instead of grazing on pasture , it is questionable whether the meat you buy in the refrigeration is high , the vitamin B12 proportion is high , " ProProc.	-6.5637
Vegans also have the opportunity to take the coenzyme in the form of tablets .	-3.3113
" My B12 values are in order " , he explains .	-2.3510
Far paths need not be taken by Proctor for food procurement .	-4.4988
Basic foodstuffs are available everywhere , and every supermarket now has soya milk and other products .	-3.5721
I find everything I need on site .	-2.3064
Only from time to time I buy something special .	-2.5827
" Many people overlook that only the finished products are expensive , but this is what is known as " ordinary " finished products " .	-11.9490
In any case , the preparation of vegan dishes is far less expensive and less time-consuming than commonly thought .	-4.1188
" In the house kitchen there is much to discover , with a few small tricks you can achieve good , if not partially better , " says Proctor .	-3.9188
Margarine instead of butter , a little more backpowder and carbon acid instead of egg , with his vegan cheese cakes , Proctor could also bring his parents to stand .	-4.7849
Family celebrations give the vegan a new spirit .	-3.4480
This has a new importance when cooking together .	-3.9812
" The situations that can arise are as different as the people themselves , " says Proctor .	-2.8124
Of course , he was skeptical .	-2.7680
Do you not taste my food anymore ?	-1.7194
" Should I feel bad now because I drink milk ? " - in the case of such questions one must act as a vegan with sensitivity to fingers .	-5.3211
" I do not reject the people , I am part of this society , " Proctor does not want to grant an enclavenda .	-9.8033
And , more precisely , everyday life does not seem to be as vegan as suspected - and the vegan does not restrict everyday life as usual .	-6.0332
Also Fast Food is allowed .	-1.3873
Pommes are available everywhere !	-1.6851
" Many donor shops offer falafel , or even a vegetarian yuffka , " says Proctor .	-2.9977
In a pizzeria it slides on pasta reports , or orders a pizza without cheese , all a question of habit .	-4.5303
The restaurants are starting to adapt to this .	-3.8515
" When I started to feed myself vegan 13 years ago , everything was even more difficult , " the New Zealander can find a development : " You have to talk to people , draw attention to it " .	-4.7658
" When enough inquiries come , they may be inclined to supplement the menu " , he hopes .	-2.9768
Vegane restaurants develop , such as the Mannheim combination or the Café Vogelfrei .	-3.9474
Proctor wants other restaurants to have a vegan dish on the menu .	-3.5272
Vegane dishes are basically there for everyone .	-2.7118
Everyone can eat them , so they are exactly the opposite of exclusive .	-2.3560
" Meat dishes are exclusive , in the truest sense of the word , because they exclude others , " says Proctor .	-3.3812
" If we want to avoid food scandals , then veganism is a safe way to make the vast majority of them impossible , " says Proctor .	-3.3697
The purchase of vegan products could be a bit difficult at the beginning .	-3.4041
Especially if you learn to understand that animal additives can also be included in earth nuts as colourers , you seem to be quick to leave the courage with respect to ethics in so many hurdles and traps .	-6.6555
Not only for this reason , Reuben Proctor and Lars Thomsen have written a book : " Veganissimo - animal ingredients and their alternatives " explains the many ingredients that are supplied with food and also cleaning products .	-4.0109
" By time you develop a scanner view and know which characters and logos you have to watch " It 's sometimes better to do small steps than stop or stumble " , Proctor knows .	-5.1463
Veganism is an important moral fingerpoint that beats awareness .	-2.9261
Perhaps he is not completely successful in carrying out his habits , but at least he can teach consumers to question their habits critically .	-4.8477
The Nasdaq OMX stock exchange operator keeps its customers in breath .	-2.9692
Trade at the Nasdaq Options Market was interrupted on Friday afternoon of German time .	-2.2303
In a communication the operator blamed for technical problems .	-2.5045
The other eleven US option markets , including two of the Nasdaq OMX , continued their business unhindered .	-2.1115
The recent incident continues a whole series of smaller and larger missions at the stock exchange operator .	-3.6930
Only on Tuesday were the Nasdaq indices not calculated for an hour due to errors in data transport .	-3.2082
In August of this year alone there had been two panels in one week .	-4.6243
First , the US Investment Bank Goldman Sachs had sent mass bugs to option markets due to technical problems .	-3.0052
As a result , stock exchange operators nearly required a whole day to look through and delete orders .	-3.9363
Two days later , half of total stock trading in the US stood at the Nasdaq Stock Exchange for several hours .	-3.6240
Furthermore , recordings had taken place last year in Facebook 's stock exchange .	-4.7466

Constance : Cycling is about 63 years old .	-12.1006
The accident occurred according to the police , when a 26-year-old man was on Thursday evening , at 9 p.m. , with a ladies ’ bicycle on the left walk from the railway station to the market place .	-6.2076
When a 63-year-old man suddenly walked from a restaurant , the cyclist , according to the police , could no longer put a brake on time .	-5.7134
During the following collision , the pedestrian was pressed against the house wall , went to the ground and a roughly 15 centimetre long wound of space went to the head .	-6.3515
A rescue car team brought injuries to the clinic for medical treatment .	-3.4749
British police issued Assange a delivery certificate to Assange	-3.4320
Today , the British police handed over an extradition note to WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange , who sought refuge and asylum in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London .	-3.7929
Scotland Yard declared that Australian , 40-year-old Australian , had been sent a “ invitation to face up ” calling for him to appear in a police guard , and added that if he did not do so , he threatened to arrest him .	-6.4746
Assange threatens extradition to Sweden because of the charge in a sexual offence after exhausting its possibilities under British law since the Supreme Court rejected its opposition to extradition early this month .	-4.5877
He feared that Stockholm would extradite him to the US on 19 June he had sought refuge in the Ecuadorian Embassy in London and asked the South American country for political asylum .	-3.2991
Scotland Yard has “ invited a 40-year-old man to stand at a police guard elected by us , ” a speaker explained .	-4.9313
He continues to violate the terms of his release on bail .	-1.8512
The message did not comment on the delivery of the police request .	-2.9634
Assange fears that he will be delivered to the United States by Sweden , accused of alleging spy accusations , after having published more than 250,000 diplomatic messages on WikiLeaks 's revelation website .	-5.4547

After stopping the police , they discovered the beverage cup between his legs .	-2.6106
Prior to the Colchester Court , Hower was guilty without having taken the necessary care and attention .	-5.1407
He received seven points and a six-month ban .	-1.7800
Howard was also sentenced to pay 90 <unk> and a victim surcharge of 100 <unk> .	-3.5035
Tax on foreign property owners against London ’ s speculation bubble	-2.3715
The Treasury has calculated the CGT measure provisionally , but is still waiting for the final decision by Chancellor George Osborne , who imposed a 7 % stamp tax in the 2012 budget on housing costing more than two million pounds , and annual fees for buyers who hold housing as a company and not as individuals .	-5.3182
Already , revenues from the stamp tax on residential property in the Westminster and Kensington & Chelsea districts , which were <unk> 708 million in tax year 2012 / 13 , combined revenues for Northern Ireland , Wales , Scotland , North-East , Northwest , Yorkshire , and the Humber region .	-4.7643
Cook said : “ Following the stamp tax increase on high-priced housing and the introduction of the related legislation against circumvention , it is difficult to claim that high quality property is taxed too low , regardless of the impact of the obsolete Community tax system . ”	-5.5305
“ But this move could make some foreign investors more restrained in terms of purchasing real estate in London , or discouraging owners from selling , ” he added .	-3.8414
First class real estate – the top five to ten percent of the housing market at price – in the prosperous London Southwest Belt , which stretches from Fulham to Wimbledon , expensive at the record value of 11.8 % last year .	-5.0454
Central London ’ s prices had an even annual growth of 5.6 % , but were overshadowed by an emerging “ domestic market , ” where the south-western part of the city , the north ( 7.4 % ) , and the east ( 6.5 % ) experienced an upward trend , such as an investigation by Savills .	-4.6291
Scientists could give more light to the relationship between the tail cutting of a dog and his mood .	-4.6100
Previous research showed that happy dogs with the tail went more to the right ( from the point of view of the dog ) , while it was the left for nervous dogs .	-4.1207
But now scientists say that other dogs can perceive and respond to these subtle differences .	-2.3575
Professor Georgio Vallortigara , a neuroscientist at the University of Trento , said : “ For humans , it is well known that the left and right brain half react differently to stimuli that produce positive or negative emotions . ”	-4.1619
Here we tried to look at this in other species .	-9.7674
He also noticed that for dogs , as with humans , the right brain half is responsible for the movement of the left , and vice versa , and that the two hemispheres played different roles in feelings .	-4.6488
In order to learn more about dogs reacting to the lateral tail weather of their specialists , researchers monitored animals while viewing other dogs .	-5.6283
They measure the heart rate of the legs and analyzed the behavior .	-2.5895
We will probably soon understand why the tail is moving in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-3.8172
Professor Vallortigara said : “ We have shown films with dogs – either a natural version or a silhouette to eliminate distracting other aspects , and we have managed the tail movement more to the left or right . ”	-4.2005
When the animals saw how an otherwise unexpressed dog moved the tail to the right ( seen from the perspective of the wedding dog ) , it remained completely relaxed .	-4.4478
However , the tail tendency was mainly left ( again from the perspective of the dog who wedelt ) , so their heart rate rose and they looked troubled .	-6.3014
According to Professor Vallortigara , dogs do not intentionally communicate with each other through these movements .	-1.9580
Rather , he is convinced that the dogs would have learned from experience in what movements they should worry about and when not .	-4.3203
He said : “ If you have different encounters with other dogs and the tail is linked in one direction to friendly behavior and the right side produces less friendly behavior , then you react on the basis of these experiences . ”	-5.3831
Researchers say that the knowledge of dog owners , veterinarians and trainers could help to better understand the emotions of their animal .	-3.8246
John Bradshaw , an expert on dog behavior and guest grant at the Faculty of Animal Healing at the University of Bristol , said that this was not the first study to examine whether it was important for dogs on the left and right .	-5.2066
Last year , a team of the University of Lincoln found out that dogs turn their head to the left when they look at an aggressive dog , and to the right when it is a satisfied dog .	-3.5486
In another research at the University of Victoria in Canada , “ dogs are more likely to go to a robot dog when being tail on the left and not right , rather than becoming troubled – exactly the other way around than in the Italian study . ”	-11.8499
According to his statement , the differences could be that dogs in the various studies did not interpret animals in films or robot dogs as dogs .	-4.1388
A study of how dogs respond to real dogs could help , he explained .	-1.7258
“ While there is considerable evidence for many different mammals that the two brain halves are used for different purposes , many of the details still need to be determined – and dogs are no exception , ” says Bradshaw .	-3.4842
Since their behavior is simply recorded , it will probably not be long before we understand why the tail sometimes moves in one direction , sometimes in the other direction .	-4.5845
Arctic Monkeys postpone appearance in Glasgow due to the disease Alex Turners	-3.6078
The rock band Arctic Monkeys has moved a performance to Glasgow after their lead singer is ill-infected .	-4.8345
The band from Sheffield should play in the Hydro on Friday .	-2.2983

In February , Pope Francis appoints First Cardinals	-2.6222
Pope Francis will first appeal to the Catholic Church on 22 February , as the Vatican announced on Thursday .	-2.2975
Cardinals are the highest clerics in the Catholic church after the Pope , and they are also the ones who elect a Pope , so that Francis will appoint the first group of men who will ultimately participate in the election of his successor .	-11.3289
Currently there are 201 cardinals .	-1.9287
However , a cardinal that reached an age of 80 can no longer participate in the Pope ’ s election – a group of 120 “ electoral cardinals . ”	-11.5044
In a statement in which the message was announced , Father Federico Lombardi , a Vatican spokesman , said that there will be a meeting of all cardinals before the ceremony is held to appoint the new cardinals , also known as consistency .	-4.4921
“ Pope Francis has decided to announce in advance his decision to convene the consistency in February so that other meetings that require the participation of Cardinals from around the world can be planned , ” said Lombardi .	-3.9690
Jack Valero of Catholic Voices said that the number of cardinal voters eligible is likely to decline until February .	-3.1543
He explained that a Pope normally appoints as many cardinals as necessary to ensure that the number of cardinals eligible for election is again 120 , and as many cardinals over 80 as he wants .	-4.9903
The consistency next year is important because it is the first since the election of Francis in March of this year , Valero said .	-2.9961
There is currently a certain overhang on the part of Europe , and in particular Italy .	-2.8449
“ It will be interesting to see whether the new Pope will appoint cardinal from the rest of the world to restore balance , ” he said .	-1.9177
Forty per cent of Catholics live in South America , but they have only a tiny number of cardinals .	-2.2985
The Cardinals will also be the first to be appointed since the creation of the Cardinal Council of Francis , a group of eight cardinals from all over the world who have the task of finding ways to reform the Church .	-4.8516
In the past , the Pope decided everything alone .	-2.4338
“ Now , Francis has selected these eight cardinals to help him , ” said Valero .	-7.8703
He stated that it was “ good possible ” that Francis asked for advice on the cardinal .	-4.2391
But we have not been in this situation until now – that is all new .	-10.2527
Valero said that bishops would typically be called to cardinal from large places , but Francis is “ full of surprises – so we do not know who he appoints . ”	-3.4862
GM calls new pickup trucks in the USA to repair the seat rest for the repair of the seat rest .	-3.9104
General Motors calls his brand new Chevrolet Silverado and GMC Sierra Pickup trucks back in 2014 to resolve a problem with the manually adjustable seat rest , a communication from the US Regulatory Authority on Friday .	-5.0538

For this reason , they do not comply with the federal vehicle safety guidelines for headrests .	-3.3542
“ When driven from behind the vehicle , it is possible that the head restraint does not properly protect the occupants , so there is an increased risk of injury , ” was to be read in the message on the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration ( NHTSA ) website .	-14.8347
The recalled models were produced between 1 August and 10 September .	-1.7446
The delivery of GM trucks began in June and represents the most important model start of the leading American car manufacturer since the insolvency restructuring in 2009 .	-3.9457
GM informed vehicle owners of the defect in the first half of October .	-2.3638
The NHTSA was unable to check the notification letter due to the 16-day Government Shutdown , which had a negative impact on car sales in October .	-4.3524
The sale of the Silverado and Sierra trucks that have been developed for the 2014 model year grew by 20 % in the first ten months of the year , GM declared on Friday .	-3.8412

A Obama voter ’ s Desperation Cry	-3.0632
I have elected President Obama twice in the hope that change is possible .	-1.9490
He says that Obama has made laudable efforts that the Republicans ’ blockade tactics have thwarted .	-3.2557
The blockade policy does not apologise for Obamacare ’ s website problems , drone attacks , or drone attacks . .	-9.3660
Obama ’ s memoirs about the 2008 campaign were a sad reminder of what could have been possible .	-2.0017
Nathaniel P. Morris is a student at the Harvard Medical School in the second year .	-2.3135
I am reading a terribly sad book .	-1.6936
It is a book that I believed would enhance my medical studies during the gloomy second year and give me hope again .	-5.0693
It is called “ The Audacity to Win ” and describes the memoirs Barack Obama ’ s presidential election in 2008 .	-3.1349
When I finished my patient records in the evening and go to bed , the book brings me back to a time when politics could inspire millions and rob the breath of a speech .	-4.8656
The election became a landslide victory and news spokesmen held to bear in mind the historical importance of this hour .	-3.4982
My classmates wept with joy and my parents gathered all the newspapers they could find .	-2.8500
A young team of visionaries was on the road to the White House and the nation was ready for change .	-2.4306
When Obama changed in office in 2008 , he had 82 % approval .	-2.5654
And then I finish the book .	-1.3106
Switching back to the present is a bad awakening as if you are torn out of a dream .	-3.4878
It is hard to remember these optimistic times – they seem to be a vague memory , a sad reminder of missed opportunities .	-2.1928
In the years since I first cast my vote , something has actually changed .	-2.8514
But it is simply not what I could have imagined .	-1.9046
I recognise the great and versatile things that Obama has achieved , from the adoption of the Affordable Care Act for Health Insurance to the military withdrawal from Iraq , the end of forced concealment of homosexuality in the army , and the killing of Osama bin Laden .	-9.3133
I agree that the party-political blockade tactics have overturned too many efforts to move our nation forward : immigration reform , a public option for health insurance and the closure of Guantanamo Bay , to name but a few .	-4.4075
But once I have defended the Obama administration countless times to colleagues and acquaintances , I have come to the end with my attempts to make a statement .	-4.0815
I have reached a point of political despair .	-1.6802
Republican blockade politics cannot explain why foreign leaders are allowed to intercept or the killing of innocent children by drones overseas .	-2.9315
It cannot explain why the National Security Agency collects data on American private life , and why Whistleblower is punished to disclose state misbehavior .	-3.7526
It cannot explain why Anwar al-Awlaki , a US citizen , was murdered without trial , and why public financing and spending limits will be avoided during the presidential elections .	-3.5456
It does not justify the results of a report stating that the White House ’ s efforts to rest the media are “ the most aggressive ... since the Nixon Government . ”	-2.8919
And recently , it cannot excuse the inability to create a simple website in the more than three years since the adoption of the Affordable Care Act .	-3.3472
I do not know whether it is what I should have expected .	-1.5333
Whether I should have understood with 18 that government work could contradict preceding political campaigns .	-3.1404
Obviously , the MEP is not a predictable course , as an opposition party and random events such as the Newtown massacre shape public debate .	-4.3454
But when I look at the above examples , they seem largely elected by the government itself .	-2.9147
And that bothers me most .	-1.3053
I voted Obama again in 2012 , not because I was enthusiastic about his candidacy .	-1.5981
Mitt Romney was a confusing and unbalanced alternative , but he did not seem to be able to define his direction and positions .	-8.8778
I had the impression that a second term for Obama , free from pressure from future elections , would fulfil the hope we had heard of for so long .	-3.4331
But , with Obama ’ s approval ratings down to less than 45 % this week , the return to 2008 has become all the harder with this book .	-3.8776
It awakens me the yearning for the many promises that have dissolved into air .	-3.3030
This week , I read a section in the book describing how Obama had to incur a serious loss against Clinton in Pennsylvania ’ s primary elections .	-3.6794
In a meeting with the electoral workers after the decision , he told his staff that they would have to come back and follow the purpose of their cause .	-3.7898
“ I want us to find our spell , ” he said .	-2.5797

Clive Palmer claims that Prime Minister Tony Abbott had conflict of interest in parental leave	-2.0209
The billionaire and Clive Palmer says that Prime Minister Tony Abbott is in a conflict of interest in his parental leave plans , because his daughters are pregnant and could therefore benefit from it .	-3.5413
The mining magnate , which is in a judicial debate on the payment of $ 6 million of carbon tax , raised the claim that he wanted to wipe out questions about whether he was in a conflict .	-4.8873
The Palmer United Party could control up to four votes in the Senate , which are important for deciding whether or not CO2 and mining taxes are deleted .	-3.5044
But Palmer claimed that only ministers could have conflicts of interest and the daughters of Abbott would benefit personally from the laws .	-2.6749
“ He is in great conflict of interests when it comes to paid parental leave , because when one of his daughters is pregnant , he has a direct interest in whether or not she gets a holiday , ” said Palmer .	-4.5114
Two months after the election , the Palmer Election Commission , with 53 votes leading the recount , officially declared the winner of the Fairfax Sunshine Coast seat .	-3.8023
Palmer called for a revision of the voting counting process to be carried out more quickly .	-3.3107

Should these elections be decided two months after the end of the vote ?	-1.3082
“ We need a better system , ” he said .	-0.9909
Why do we not have a system in which we invade , enter the data into a computer , choose immediately and then have the result at 6 : 30 in the evening ?	-4.5597
Palmer also criticized the use of pencils when marking voting papers .	-2.5077
Do you use them because you can wipe out the results if you do not like them ?	-11.1476
To vote with pencils nowadays is incredible .	-3.0442
The election commission has examined the options for an electronic election and recently published a joint legislative proposal with New Zealand .	-2.9098

RBS suspends two foreign-exchange dealers	-1.6558
The Royal Bank of Scotland has suspended two traders from its foreign exchange department , so two people who are familiar with the situation ; this is another indication that the global authority investigation into alleged currency manipulation is on track rapidly .	-5.8373
Some of the world ’ s largest banks , including UBS , Barclays , Deutsche Bank , and RBS , confirmed that they cooperate with the authorities in investigations into the world ’ s largest financial market , with $ 5.3 trillion changing owners every day .	-3.7729
The two retailers would be the first RBS employees who were suspended in the expanding investigation that caused the Libor interbanking scandal .	-4.6805
The Bank , which did not comment on the suspension , confirmed this month that it had received information requests from authorities .	-2.6650
“ Our investigations on this issue continue and we cooperate fully with the FCA and other regulatory authorities , ” said the Bank two weeks ago .	-2.8632
Last month , the situation suggested that RBS had forwarded the records of e-mails and instant messages sent by and to an earlier merchant to the British Supervisory Authority , the Financial Conduct Authority .	-4.3363
This trader , Richard Usher , had left the RBS 2010 and is now supposed to have been told by his current position as European Head of Forex Spot Trade at JPMorgan .	-4.0335
Rohan Ramchandani , head of the European Spot Trading at Citi , was told this week and Matt Gardiner , former senior currency dealer at Barclays and UBS , was suspended this week at Standard Chartered .	-3.9736
None of these traders was accused of any misconduct .	-2.8865
Bankers at Barclays and the Citigroup belonged to the Instant Message Group of Usher , said the situation close to people .	-3.4500
UBS announced this week that it took steps against some of its employees after the Swiss regulatory authority , Finma , declared that it investigated a suspected manipulation of the foreign-exchange market in a number of Swiss banks .	-4.6485
At least six authorities worldwide – the European Commission , Finma , the Swiss Competition Authority Weko , the FCA , the US Ministry of Justice , and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority – are currently dealing with accusations that bankers will have to deal with transactions in the currency market .	-4.4611
HSBC , Citigroup , JPMorgan and Credit Suisse have also launched internal investigations or received information requests from authorities , said persons familiar with the situation .	-3.1402
Banks confuse instant messages and emails from several years in search of cases of misconduct .	-3.4009
The news about these investigations has turned traders into an area that in recent years has been one of the most profitable trading units of investment banks , but this year was under pressure , because low currency volatility limits speculators ’ chances .	-5.4377
Some bankers have tried to play down the affair and said that it is almost impossible to manipulate the extended and highly liquid foreign-exchange market , but leading traders believe that this is not necessarily true .	-3.9213
One leading trader noted that despite the enormous daily volume of foreign-exchange trading , fragmentation of liquidity between the various trading platforms and the increasing use of own internal platforms by banks leads to “ influence the market with very low ticket prices . ”	-5.1600
The news came out on the same day when Credit Suisse announced that she had announced this week to a trader of her London Exchange Traded Funds office after causing a loss of almost $ 6 million at the end of last year .	-4.5481
The Bank promptly informed the competent authorities and cooperates with them .	-1.8799
“ We are sure that the dealer has acted on his own and that the matter is contained , ” Credit Suisse explained .	-3.5679
The fence painted on the Bechtele plot	-3.1386
A group of the citizens ' initiative " Swiss meadow " has beautified the Bechtele fence on the Bechtele plot on the spa promenade in Bad Herrenalb .	-5.1190
Moreover , she cleaned and broadened the foot , it is called in a press release .	-3.6837
The planned cover of the disappearing house in the back part of the property was not permitted for security reasons , because the terrain is in danger of slipping down .	-5.8175
Alfred Abel , who currently manages the plot , had agreed to beauty with his colleague Reinhard Domke of the BI .	-4.5133
Before the BI came up , a transparent message was sent with the message ' We are in favour ' .	-4.7631
This did not bother the approximately 20 members of the citizens ' initiative in their action .	-3.9580
Her motto on the big poster was called " We are against Bauruins " .	-2.4635
In doing so , she wanted to draw attention to the danger of even larger ruins in the Swiss meadow - the huge project should one day fail .	-4.6615
In consultation with many passers-by in front of the " building site " , it became clear that some citizens believe that the implementation of the city project will be better for many , although not few have the same questions about the dimension of the presented project as the BI .	-6.4483
But they are beginning to resign because the city further delays these answers , it is called by the BI .	-3.6022
As has been said , the public statements of the Mayor also have an impact .	-3.6044
In May , at the meeting of the Council of Ministers , he was afraid of the thermal baths if the public voted against the plans for a bathing and wellness complex in the Swiss meadow .	-6.4374
Some seem to be almost frightened , others feel that they are a " plumbing blackmail attempt " to the population , as the BI press release continues .	-6.4388
The BI thanked the donors for the color and all helpers .	-2.1399
Rangnick Celt for Shiris : Mane no King of Wrap	-5.0757
As satisfied Ralf Rangnick is also with the current high form of the German Federal Liga table guide Red Bull Salzburg , the sports director of the " bullets " was disappointed by the referees .	-4.8724
" There is a dangerous tendency for Mane and Alan to be pushed into the category of Schwalbenkönige , " he took the two offensive wirblers on Thursday at a press conference in Salzburg in protection .	-4.2850
Recent Rangnick ’ s critique was Yellow for Mane at the 3 : 0 Val Gardena last Sunday , when Senegalese became an alleged actress - who was not , however , as the TV pictures showed .	-6.1172
" A stark mistake , " said Rangnick , the referee of Harkam referred to as " completely overstretched " .	-5.7808
Harkam also contributed " his part " to the escalation between Salzburg-Coach Roger Schmidt and Val Garden-Trainer Adi Hütter after the match .	-3.0107
He decided to defend his German countryman : " I would have behaved like Roger Schmidt in every single situation .	-3.8191
Schmidt himself wants to have no contact with his colleague after the skirmish with hutter .	-4.1673
I don 't know why .	-1.6005
" Because I am the one who was insulted , " emphasized the 46-year-old .	-3.1799
In view of the success race , however , Rangnick agreed with a hymn of praise .	-5.3363

Supreme Court confirms Obama ’ s health law	-9.2744
It is a great victory for the Obama administration : the US Supreme Court today decided that the closely linked health law is constitutional .	-3.3419
With five to four votes , the judges judged that the individual mandate of the patient protection and affordable care act – it forces US citizens to complete health insurance or pay a punishment by 2014 – is constitutional within the framework of the state ’ s tax authority .	-11.1229
The chief judge John Roberts beat the side of the four more liberal members of the Chamber , while the judges Scalia , Thomas , Alito and Kennedy decided against it .	-3.3829
The Court also confirmed the remaining sections of the 2700 page comprehensive law and also took the view that states would either have to expand access requirements for Medicaid or otherwise remove all state medical assistance would not be unconstitutional .	-6.3245
The proceedings against the law had been tried by 26 states and the National Federation of Independent Business .	-3.3048
The law was firmly rejected by all the leading Republican presidential candidates , including the ultimate challenger Mitt Romney , in the pre-election campaign in 2012 .	-2.5796

" Many citizens will not have noticed it , the red points for Sunday cleaning are still at various letter boxes of the core city and the districts , but read the small print on the yellow containers of the Post AG , it is quickly discovered that the empire is no longer held on Sunday and public holidays " , announces the FDP . .	-12.3549

Whether in Hofheim and Rosengarten is emptied Sunday will not be answered in the answer to the FDP request .	-3.8522
The FDP ’ s social and youth spokesperson , Fritz Röhrenbeck , wants to follow up here .	-4.0529
Sunday cleaning is an important postal service .	-3.1878
" This undertaking is radically and unreasonable , despite the price increase for letters on January 2013 . "	-3.4471
Thomas Bittner , Liberal Group Chairman and City Association Chairman , supports his group colleagues : ' What annoys me is the fact that the empty hours are gradually changed or even deleted ' .	-6.0257
The post office is miles away from proximity to the citizens .	-3.1837
" At least the letter boxes must be emptied again on Sundays in the neighbourhood of Neuschloss and Rosengarten " , says Bittner and the tube beck unisono .	-5.2109
Even the core city is valid , especially non-mobile fellow citizens should be able to reach a letter box with a sunday empty .	-18.6552
Röhrenbeck asked in the city parliament whether the city administration plans to talk to the post office about this matter .	-4.4076
Mayor Erich Maier replied that the post did not communicate with Lampertheim .	-1.6737

He thanked the attendees for their willingness to cooperate and stressed that the day of care was a suitable instrument for strengthening the connection between man and nature .	-4.6537
It gives every citizen the opportunity to focus on nature itself .	-3.1367
At the same time , the tourist aspect can also be considered ecologically .	-3.7502
This ecological aspect was described by Friederike Tribukait of the Nature Department of the President of Freiburg following the welcome by Landrat Tilman Bollacher , who took over the patronage and wanted the action a good success .	-5.6674
According to Tribukait , the tourist objective is to preserve the old Allmendweidfeld with its specially protected habitat types by opening and connecting to the pastures that still exist .	-6.7883
Certain species , such as rare butterflies and grass huts , cannot overcome barriers in the form of forest surfaces .	-3.2055
You need these free connections for conservation .	-3.0861
Tribukait said she would not miss here to break a lance for the planned biosphere area .	-3.0785
The current measure does not just fit in seamlessly with this planning .	-3.4801
A biosphere area also offers an opportunity for sustainable economic and ecological development based on the internationally recognised Unesco status and thus a continuous addition to what has been achieved with the Life project and the previous days of care for the future .	-4.9622

Google , Samsung , Huawei sued for Nortel patents	-1.2313
The group , which owns thousands of former Nortel patents , strengthened an avalanche of complaints on Thursday for patent infringement against mobile phone manufacturers , including Google , the company that was overburdened by Nortel during the Nortel insolvency auction .	-5.6544
Rockstar , the consortium that the Nortel patents bought for $ 4.5 billion , sued Samsung Electronics Co Ltd , HTC Corp , Huawei , and four other companies for patent infringements before the US District Court in Texas .	-3.2906
Rockstar is a community owned by Apple , Microsoft , BlackBerry , Ericsson and Sony .	-2.3569
Google is accused of patent injury in seven cases .	-1.6295
The patents concern technology that matches search terms on the Internet with relevant advertising , so the complaint that thus affects the core of Google 's search engine business .	-4.7206
Representatives of Samsung , Huawei , HTC and Rockstar were not directly accessible .	-1.7867
Samsung , Huawei and HTC manufacture mobile phones that work with Google ’ s Android operating system , which is in sharp competition with Apple and Microsoft ’ s mobile products .	-3.9217
In 2011 , Google issued an initial imperative of over $ 900 million for Nortel patents .	-2.7792
Google increased his offer several times and offered USD 4.4 billion last .	-2.8972
After being overborn with the Nortel patents of Rockstar , Google Motorola Mobility acquired $ 12.5 billion , a deal motivated partly by Motorola ’ s patent library .	-4.5120
“ Although Google failed to purchase the claim patents during the auction , Google has violated and continues to do the patents , ” says Google .	-5.7610
Rockstar calls for high compensation from Google , because it claims that Google ’ s patent infringement is intentional , according to the accusation .	-3.9722
Egypt ’ s First Free Elected Presidency	-1.9887
Mohammed Morsi is swearing , but his day of triumph is not likely to mark the end of political disputes in Egypt .	-4.3830
Islamist Mohammed Morsi promised a “ new Egypt , ” when he was the first freely elected president of the country to succeed Husni Mubarak , who was expelled from office for 16 months earlier .	-3.5525
With his inauguration before the Supreme Constitutional Court , Morsi became the first freely elected Islamist president of the Arab world and Egypt ’ s fifth Head of State since the fall of the monarchy about 60 years ago .	-11.0621
He took the oath in front of the 18 black robes judges of the court , who has his seat at the Nile and has found an ancient Egyptian temple .	-5.4326
“ We strive for a better future , a new Egypt , and a second republic , ” said Morsi at the solemn ceremony broadcast live on state television .	-2.7160
“ Today , the Egyptian people have laid the foundations for a new life – absolute freedom , genuine democracy and stability , ” said Morsi , a US-trained engineer and member of the Muslim Brotherhood , a fundamentalist group , who , since its foundation 84 years ago , had been strongly targeted by the government .	-4.9944
Hundreds of soldiers and policemen guarded the building when Morsi entered a small car convoy shortly after eleven o 'clock .	-3.0589
Only a few hundred supporters had gathered in front of the court to acclaim the new president , and , unlike the presidential brunch of the Mubarak era , traffic was stopped for a short time , so that the autoconvoi could cross the typically lively street that connects the city centre with the southern suburbs .	-6.4553
As an uncharismatic “ replacement wheel ” of the Brotherhood , his personal prestige has increased since his victory and Friday speech , presenting not only as a candidate for the Islamists , but all those who wanted to target the 2011 uprising efforts against authoritarian Mubarak .	-4.4063
“ Egypt is now a civilian , national , constitutional , and modern state , ” Morsi , dressed in a blue suit with red cow , explained to the judges in the wood-panelled chamber in which he took office .	-5.3174
Later , Morsi went to Cairo University , where he was supposed to deliver his inaugural speech .	-3.6725

You thought travel agencies belong thanks to the Internet of the past ?	-2.1449
Flight Centre appears to be opposed to the trend .	-8.0708
The company has increased its profit prospects for the whole year and expects record revenues from holidaymakers in Australia and the United Kingdom .	-3.9593
The travel company now assumes an adjusted annual gain before taxes of between $ 325 and $ 340 million , compared to $ 305 to $ 315 million in its previous forecast .	-4.4174
If the current targets are achieved , that means growth of 12 to 17 % compared to the record profit of $ 290.4 million in 2011 / 12 .	-3.6418
As Managing Director Graham Turner announced , Flight Centre earned eight percent profit in the first half of the year and had a strong start to the second half , especially in Australian and British private operations .	-4.3919
“ Since the beginning of the year , our ten countries have been profitable , and some of them are on the right track towards record revenue before interest and taxes , ” he explained .	-12.4609
These include Australia and the United Kingdom , which typically belong to our strongest earnings agents .	-3.4901
In Australia , the leisure industry has recovered in the second half of the year , offsetting a slightly weaker market for business travel .	-10.2139

Salem : Johanna Rahner at the Ecumenical Dialogue Forum	-2.1070
At the next Ecumenical Forum on Monday 21 October , the New Museum of the Castle deals with the theme of " Hell with Hell - Theological thoughts on today 's handling of the last things " .	-5.1056
Referentin is Professor Johanna Rahner .	-1.3770
The Ecumenical Forum for Dialogue is an initiative of the Catholic and evangelical parishes Salem , Salem Castle and the Cultural Office of the Lake Constance .	-4.1690
Johanna Rahner wants to examine in the forum how today people classify the " last things " after death .	-3.7710
Had people been too aware of this over the past centuries , focusing on the images of heaven and hell , " which still shape our ideas " , the contemporary prophetic teaching of the hopes of completion is more characterized by a certain embarrassment or even language lack .	-6.7622
" The greater hope has been exorcised by religious criticism by Christians , " says the speaker .	-3.1798
They ' provided us with so many question marks that the exclamation marks seem to have been lost ' .	-4.2250
Johanna Rahner continues to say , ' But the crucial challenge remains the anger of death ' .	-2.8998
This is the question of ' yearning ' that dreams of everything being good in the end .	-11.5663
Johanna Rahner , born in Baden-Baden in 1962 , studied Catholic Theology and Biology at the Albert-Ludwigs University of Freiburg from 1982 to 1989 .	-2.2871

Ilmensee : Second Mountainbike race enthusiasts attending participants .	-3.5587
In splendid weather , 214 cyclists came to Illmensee to complete the round course across the hill chains around the lake .	-4.6149
This tells Ulrich Knobel of the organizing sports club Ilmensee .	-3.0678
Participants , especially at the short distance of more than 15 kilometres and 300 metres of altitude , were also numerous cyclists who wanted to exercise their hobby in a competitive atmosphere .	-4.9089
Two junior drivers from the German top class were also at the start in this competition : Felix Bader from Bad Waldsee and Pascal Treubel from Aach-Linz came with the recommendation for good places at the German Championships .	-5.0976
These two could expect to be departed from the field .	-4.0034
As in the previous year , Felix Bader was able to save a small amount of time up to its destination and defended his title as a total winner of the short-distance .	-5.0963
Pascal Treubel was able to place himself again on in the . in .	-11.7777
At the ladies it was Theresa Duelli of the team nightmare who managed it to the top of the winner stairs .	-3.9948
Anne Adel came from Illmensee and Leonie drivers from Owingen .	-2.9487
An enjoyable development is the growing number of drivers living or working in the community .	-10.6765
Not only in terms of capacity , the whole range of sportsmen was represented .	-3.3578
The age structure also ran among the oldest starters from ten years in the youngest and .	-5.8207
More topathletes started this year in the main race .	-4.0045
Four drivers were able to resign themselves from top regional drivers .	-3.0549
Among them Philipp Pangerl , a mountain bike semi-professional from the Black Tusk Racing team .	-2.7604
Pangerl , along with a team college , has already been the world champion for twelve hours driving .	-5.4736
This year he became European Champions in this special discipline .	-1.8845
Roland Ballerstedt , who already names two German master titles in the Duathlon , is one of his own .	-4.9597
After 45 kilometres and 900 metres of altitude , there was a summer slope final in front of the Three Lakes Hall .	-12.0152
Pangerl grabbed the first over the finish line .	-3.6976

On the way through mud , river and jungle for free medical care .	-2.4763
Dr. Georges Bwell provides free medical assistance to remote villages in Cameroon .	-2.4080
Bwelle and his team spend almost every weekend treating hundreds of patients with treatment for hundreds of patients .	-3.1391
There are not many doctors in the West African country , but one for 5,000 people .	-2.1922

You can vote for him or any of the other heroes in the top 10 to choose him as “ CNN Hero of the Year ” .	-2.6226
The winner receives $ 250,000 to continue his exceptional work .	-2.0663
For 21 years , Georges Bwelle saw his sick father lost consciousness and traveled to hospitals that did not have the means to help him .	-3.5636
Jamef Bwell was injured in 1981 in a car accident near Yaoundé , the capital of Cameroon .	-2.8032
First he had only a broken arm , but then an inflammation that expanded to his brain and caused a hamatom that would affect him for the rest of his life .	-4.4901
“ There were no neurosurgeons in Cameroon , ” says Georges Bwell .	-2.0421
We would have brought him out of Cameroon if we had the money .	-1.9260
Instead , Bwelle spent years accompanying his father in overcrowded clinics and hospitals to get the treatment they had to offer .	-3.2081
“ It ’ s not easy , ” Bwelle comments .	-2.4377
You can leave the house at five o 'clock in the morning and run to the hospital to be the first , and it is not first .	-4.2378
There are many patients .	-1.5874
Some people even die because they have to wait .	-1.2786
The situation has hardly changed since Bwelle ’ s father died in 2002 .	-1.7652
In Cameroon , there is only one doctor for each 5,000 people , such as the World Health Organisation .	-2.9241
On the other hand , the relationship in the United States is with a doctor for 413 people .	-3.1152
But even if there was a doctor for them , most cameruns could not afford to visit .	-3.0816
Two out of five people in the country live below the poverty line , and nearly three quarters of health-care spending in the country are private .	-2.8325
“ The only problem they have is poverty , ” says Bwelle .	-1.4281
And poverty makes it impossible to enjoy life .	-0.8440
His father , and so many of his compatriots , suffered in Bwelle the decision to do something about it .	-3.7233
Dr. Georges Bwell and his volunteer carried out 700 free operations last year .	-1.9654
He himself became a doctor and worked as a vessel surgeon at Central Hospital in Yaoundé .	-3.1052
He also established a non-profit organization called ASCOVIME , which travels in rural areas at weekends and offers free medical care .	-3.8311
Since 2008 , he and his voluntary group have helped almost 32,000 people .	-1.8172
Almost every Friday he compelled and up to 30 people in small buses and drive with the tightened medical equipment on the roof over unfortified terrain into the villages that need help .	-5.2443
Not always runs smoothly .	-1.8999
Even more than once they had to push the vehicles through rivers and mud .	-2.7740
But when they arrive , they will receive like heroes : a feast , singing and dance , and the best accommodation that the place has to offer .	-3.7776
In these villages , free medical care really is a reason for celebration and threshold – with its broad smile and borderless energy – is happy to be part of the happy celebration .	-4.6325
Next morning the team will start examining hundreds of patients .	-2.9830
“ We treat 500 people per journey , ” says Bwelle .	-2.6355
They come from an area of 60 km around the village – and on foot .	-2.7192
Each weekend clinic offers medical care in a number of areas .	-2.4584
Many people are treated for malaria , tuberculosis , malnutrition , diabetes , parasites and sexually communicable diseases .	-1.6416
Others receive crutches , glasses , or free birth certificates – a document needed for school but many poor families simply cannot afford .	-3.3324
In the evening , the team performs simple local stunning operations .	-1.9852
The operations usually take place in a school , town hall or apartment ; after the intervention the patients are up and go into the recreational area to make room for the next .	-5.7498
The lighting for the OP and disinfectant equipment is fed by the group 's generator and thus work Bwelle and its volunteers until the early hours of the Sunday .	-4.4780
It is an exhausting pension , but village musicians usually help keep the team motivated .	-3.4851
“ They drum all night to keep wake and continue our work , ” says Bwelle .	-4.2818
The team then returns to the city on Sunday , tired but proud of the work done .	-3.4320
The group – a mixture of Cameroon doctors and foreign medical students – has carried out 700 free operations last year and knows that its work makes a huge difference to the people that it helps .	-4.8318
A man explained that the free operation of a breakthrough that he received now allows him to work again .	-3.9206
“ This changes the future of my family , ” the man said .	-2.5656
In addition to weekend clinics and his work as a surgeon in hospital , Bwelle also works in private clinics in Yaoundé at night .	-3.6759
With this second job , he finances 60 % of his non-profit activity , according to Bwelle ; the rest come from private donations .	-3.5967
“ I really do not know when he sleeps , ” says Katie O 'Malley , who studied at Drexel University in Philadelphia Medicine in the second year and is voluntarily involved in Bwell ’ s group .	-4.2368
It is always in the hospital or trying to raise money for the organisation so that it can go to these campaigns .	-4.3068
This is an opportunity for medical and health care students such as O 'Malley , who come from the USA and Europe and support Bwell , to gain practical experience that they would never get at home .	-4.3272
“ We can be involved in operations where we help to pour blood or hold the instruments for Dr. Bwell ” , says O 'Malley .	-5.6009
This would never be possible in America as a medical student in the second year .	-1.7059
Students normally pay their trip to Cameroon and bring frequently donated sanitary material .	-3.1260
Once in Yaoundé , Bwelle takes over accommodation , transport and guidance .	-3.6963
" He is certainly a hero " , says O 'Malley .	-2.8149
He dedicates his life to this organisation and his desire to help the Cameroon people know no boundaries .	-2.6019
For Bwelle , the almost constant work is not a burden .	-3.0254
Helping others to live a happier life , thereby fulfilling a promise that he gave to his father , gives him great pleasure .	-4.1434
“ I am so happy to do this work , ” says Bwelle .	-2.6068
And I am thinking of my father .	-1.6103
I hope he sees what I do .	-1.3029
I do it to bring people back to laugh and relieve the pain .	-2.6787

Excellent Mastered the War	-9.4765
The role of Santiago , the old man in Hemingway 's novel " The Old Man and the Sea " , is Horst Janson cut to the body .	-4.0662
Janson is himself an old hare in his meter , the art of acting .	-3.5231
The old man , Santiago , cannot do anything about fishing .	-2.9360
Thus , the two are just great complements .	-11.0071
It almost seems to be possible to see the wrinkles in the neck of the old man , of whom the fishing young Manolo speaks .	-4.4577
If Santiago is tired of life bowed down on the chair , that is real at Janson .	-4.2010
In addition , the role of the old fisherman is through and through a character role that Janson plays an excellent role .	-4.5423
Hemingway told the story of a fighter , a courageous man who does not give up and eventually wins the fight against fish through his knowledge and also his will .	-4.2780
Janson is on stage in many distances as a sole player .	-4.5705
He manages to focus the attention of the audience so that his monologues are not boring at any moment .	-3.4517
His efforts to finally draw the fish to the surface of the water are so real that the spectators forget that the sea consists of only blue-lit water bottles .	-4.6157
Director Jens Hasselmann allows the old man to act in front of the fishing village .	-2.3489
In the course of the performance , he sets the respectively active scene into light : the hut of Santiago , the bar of the singer Marie-Luise Gunst , who sings Cuba 's sense of life with her songs and their wonderful voice .	-5.7261
The four musicians play Cuba ’ s rhythm and are also guests of the bar .	-3.0183
Tourism : Decline to the Romans	-1.5727
About 120 metres long , a sewage channel from the Roman era is preserved below Cologne .	-4.6913
Those who visit Cologne do not pass by the Cathedral .	-3.7631
Around 157 metres the two towers flourish into the sky and make it the second highest church building in Europe .	-4.0954
But only a few visitors who admire the two filigrant church towers suggest that there is a lot to discover under the cathedral .	-4.8018
Rainer Schulze is an expert in Cologne 's underworld .	-1.9139
Meeting point for its guided tours is the service centre of Cologne-Tourism directly on the Duomo .	-3.6648
The tour begins inspectacularly : " We start in the underground car park " , says Schulze .	-3.5883
In the 1970s , the city fathers wanted an autogeneous city , so the remains of the old city wall stayed only what was not too big .	-6.3129
Most of the users of the parking garage are therefore passing by the Roman remains and only park their car .	-6.0187
But if you look closer , the Parkdeck D2 discovers an archaeological site separated from metal bars .	-5.5396
You can see about five metres high ruins of hand-sized stones .	-4.0123
" They are remains of the Roman walls built in the second half of the first century after Christ " , tells Schulze .	-3.9019
Before returning to daylight , Schulze leaves the participants at the upper park level with a glimpse of a dark , 15 metres deep shaft .	-5.6903
This is the fountain of the old cathedral , which unfortunately is hardly noticed .	-3.7070
Next station of the tour is the pretorium , and here the participants go down to the depth .	-4.5745
We are witnessing here the office of the once most powerful man north of the Alps , the pretor of the CCAA .	-4.0102
What CCAA means is a visitor wants to know .	-2.5022
" The abbreviation stands for " Colonia Claudia Ara Agrippinensium " , which means in good German as " City of Roman Law and City of Agrippines , founded under Emperor Claudius at the place of the Altar for the Emperor " .	-4.6890
And the pretorium is the former palace , the centre of power of the Roman empire on the Rhine .	-3.7736
From the front of the exhibition , a tunnel access leads to the Roman wastewater channel , which is preserved for about 120 meters .	-12.6258
" You can walk a piece along the so-called Cloaca Maxima if you want " , muntert Schulze the guests up .	-4.2107
A surprise still has school .	-2.1151
After taking the key at the cashier , it leads the group to a 16-meter deep , hidden shaft .	-4.9517
" We are now in the mikwe , a ritual Jewish bath , " he explains .	-1.8280
The Jewish community built their bath deep into the ground to get to the groundwater that was essential for ritual washing .	-3.7271
In the lower end of the mikwe , whose origins date back to the eighth century , different waterstates can be read through changing levels of the Rhine .	-5.6221
The mikwe will be part of an archaeological zone on the Town Hall Square for which construction works are to begin soon .	-3.9148
However , some years will pass until completion .	-3.3106
Almost hacked : Reruption of rocker process	-4.4297
A bloody attack in the rocker milieu is reopened after more than four years .	-3.7537
A trial for attempted slaughter , dangerous body injury and property damage against two thirty years has begun before the Frankfurt Court ( Oder ) .	-6.3499
It is accompanied by strict safety measures .	-2.1098
The accused keep silent for the start .	-3.0165
They should have been active in the rocker scene and belonged to the bandidos at the time .	-3.6192
In June 2009 , the Public Prosecutor accuses them of stopping and hitting on three men in a car with unknown accomplices in Finowfurt .	-5.2889
All the victims were seriously injured , a man almost lost his leg .	-2.4013
The victims should have heard about the competing faction of Hells Angels .	-3.0536
One should have been a high-level member from Berlin .	-2.1921
The preceding was apparently a persecution hunt with several cars .	-3.8135
According to the charge , it was about fighting victims and a demonstration of power .	-3.9602
The two accused had been released in a first trial at the beginning of 2012 .	-3.1162
A court spokesman said then that it was not possible to prove that the men were actually involved in the bloody fear .	-4.1995
The perpetrators had worn masks and had not been recognized .	-2.2551
The Federal Court of Justice repealed the judgment after the Public Prosecutor 's revision and referred it back to the local court for renewed trial .	-4.8498
One of the accused is currently in the open enforcement because of another offence .	-3.2771
The first concern was the reconstruction of the processes in the eight .	-5.6842
The Commissioner identified at that time was invited to witness .	-2.9931
The center was cellular phone calls by the accused and others who had heard the police .	-4.5687
It is difficult that rockers almost always abide by - and do not say - legislation before the courts .	-5.1676
This also applies to the victims .	-1.6227
In the first trial , only one of the victims had been unpacked .	-8.7306
Stefan Golfier of the Public Prosecutor Frankfurt ( Oder ) said on demand that new traces have emerged since the last procedure .	-4.0586
11 more days of negotiation are due for the process .	-3.7262
The disposable society does not think it thinks	-2.5093
The night was long , music loud and the mood good , but eventually it goes home .	-2.9207
Only : Hunger is noticeable in people ’ s trees on the front-passenger and back seat .	-9.6628
Clearly , one or other cocktail or sect may be responsible for this !	-3.4824
What is closer than to drive to the next drive in order to treat a small thing ?	-5.0544
I admit that I am happy to be with you when it comes to fast food holes late at night or early in the morning .	-5.1500
A few Pommes , a Cola , a Burger - and then nix as from home and in bed !	-2.6221
But the obvious differences between myself and other hungry disco angers occur at home .	-4.5212
Because what has to be missing is that you throw your fast-food bags out of the car window with constant regularity ? ! !	-12.4503
Especially on weekends , paper bags are thrown away on the streets and on parking places .	-5.0638
'Why ? ' I wonder .	-1.5314
Are people too doof to take the bags at home respective to the next rubbish ?	-11.4053
It is not just the case that the paper produce makes the landscape a disguise .	-5.1248
Transport facilities such as guiding planks have already hidden bags and caused accidents .	-5.4560
Through what was said ' disposable society ' , she probably does not even know what that word actually means .	-16.3622
In the evening , when you 're on the road , you 'll know what a backbank can look like after nights of celebration : clothes , bottles , and other rubbish .	-9.3321
Some of the bags would be nixed , unlike the road , where nobody wants to trample on the food remains of others .	-15.1945
I can see the day when cities and municipalities will be blocked by the way - and the fast-food chains will have to demand deposits for their bags .	-6.8847
Obama ’ s Retreat in Health Policy	-2.1063
According to heavy criticism , President Obama yesterday withdrawn his often repeated , clear promise : “ If you like your health insurance , you can keep it . ”	-4.1701
After hundreds of thousands of insurers received a letter of notice , the Republicans have in recent days accused the president of deceiving the American public .	-3.0995
Yesterday , Obama relativised his original promise .	-1.7080
“ The vast majority of citizens with functioning health insurance can keep them , ” he said in a speech in Boston .	-3.0640
In response to the numerous media reports on redundancies , Obama called on those Americans who received such communications to look around the free market for new insurance .	-4.2194
Most citizens could thus receive better , more comprehensive health insurance at the same price , or cheaper than predicted .	-3.6867
“ You come a better offer , ” he said .	-1.7451
The government described it as little surprise that the five per cent of the population , which themselves have completed an insurance rate , would have to look at a different rate , because their treaty does not meet the new standards under the Affordable Care Act .	-6.3849
“ I would like to say to these Americans very directly : they deserve better , ” said Sebelius at a hearing before the House of Representatives ’ Energy and Trade Committee .	-4.0768
Sebelius , who is responsible for implementing the Affordable Care Act , declared that the launch of the online platform has been “ miserable ” since October .	-2.5631
“ I am as frustrated and angry as anyone else , ” she said .	-2.1593
I am determined to regain your confidence .	-1.0291
This phrase of an elevated Sebelius to a seated adviser at yesterday 's hearing in the House of Representatives was included after a dispute with Republican MEP Billy Long from Missouri , concerning whether she should be obliged to participate in Obamacare .	-5.9174
After more than three hours of hearing , Long Sebelius repeatedly asked why the “ architectural ” of the Affordable Care Act did not voluntarily refrain from providing state-sponsored insurance to complete a fare at HealthCare.gov , which it is now trying to sell to millions of Americans .	-5.0203
Government in Jerusalem does not confirm attack on Syria ’ s Air Base	-2.7708
An American government official who wanted to remain anonymous claimed on Thursday that Israeli warplanes had attacked an air base in Syria ’ s Latakia one day earlier .	-4.4010
The aim was ' missiles and associated equipment ' , which the Israeli Government feared were intended for Lebanese Hezbollah , as the CNN said .	-4.0165
Syrian and Lebanese media , as well as the Arab channel Al-Arabiya , had previously reported that the base in the port town of Latakia was shot from Thursday night , and that the Israelis blamed for it .	-4.5252
The Israeli TV channel 2 showed satellite images of the base in Latakia , where Russian defensive missiles of type S-125 Newa and a battery of SA-3 missiles were seen , according to Channel 2 , have a range of 35 kilometres and explosive heads can carry up to 70 kilograms .	-5.0731
Uncertain The Jerusalem Government has not officially confirmed the attack .	-2.7690
However , the Reuters news agency quotes an also anonymous Israeli government official in the words that he believes that Israel has carried out the attack , but is not sure .	-4.2750
A speaker from the Israeli Ministry of Defence said : ' We are not commenting on these reports ' .	-3.1415
In the daily Yedioth Ahronoth newspaper , the journalist Ron Ben-Yishai emphasized that the Syrian regime had tried to deliver soil air missiles to Hezbollah earlier , in some cases successfully .	-9.7457
The Israeli government repeatedly warned that any attempt to supply Hezbollah with chemical or other dangerous weapons would mean crossing a ' red line ' that would follow a military response .	-3.3720
John Kerry says in an unprecedented admission that US spying has “ gone inappropriately too far . ”	-3.9794
John Kerry , with an unexpected admission , suggested a weakening of the US ’ s defensive attitude towards its surveillance programs by saying that spying has gone “ inappropriately too far in certain cases . ”	-5.0800
The Foreign Minister also admitted that , together with Barack Obama , he shared responsibility for being “ autopilot , ” when the explosive revelations of the Whistleblower Edward Snowden became public about the NSA ’ s spy activities .	-4.8543
Leaked information has left the US government into a diplomatic storm of indignation from its allies .	-3.1443
At the Open Government Conference in London , a speech transmitted by video connection , Kerry said : “ There was no doubt that the President and I , as well as others in the government , have heard of some of the things that almost happened by car pilot , simply because the capacity for what was going on in the Second World War and the difficult years of the Cold War , and of course 11 September . ”	-8.4383
He then admitted , as the first senior member of the US administration , that the US spying had crossed a border , but also stressed that no rights have been abused .	-4.3344
He said : ‘ In some cases , this has gone inappropriately too far . ’	-2.8960
The President is determined to provide clarity , and is therefore carrying out a thorough investigation so that no one has to feel that abuse is taking place .	-11.6690
I assure you that the rights of innocent people are not affected in this process .	-2.1350
Kerry insisted , however , that the NSA was a force of good and that many lives had been saved through their surveillance operations .	-3.9942
He added , “ We are dealing with a new world in which people are willing to blow themselves into the air . ”	-2.8334
There is a radical extremism in the world that is forgetting to kill people , blow up and attack governments .	-3.1731
So what if we were able to intercept and stop this before it happens ?	-3.0329
We have indeed prevented aircraft crashes , attacks on buildings and the murder of people because we learnt of such plans in advance .	-4.0645
Meanwhile , US legislators will travel to Europe to dispel concerns about alleged American espionage and convince Europeans of the need to continue working with the US on anti-terrorism efforts , as the Chairman of the Senate Subcommittee said on Thursday .	-4.4273
Senator Chris Murphy from Connecticut said he spoke to representatives of the European Parliament and other people this week , worried about their threats to stop participating in anti-terrorist organisations due to the frustration of National Security Agency surveillance .	-3.7955
“ It is very important for US national security interests to keep Europeans on board with regard to our joint efforts against terrorism , ” said Murphy , who is in the Senate for the first time and chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Foreign Affairs and European Affairs , in an interview in Washington .	-4.3788
I also go to Europe to make it clear that we must continue to work together in the fight against terrorism , regardless of their anger over the NSA programmes .	-3.1973
Media reports that the NSA has recorded millions of telephone data in Europe have burdened relations with some US allies , although the head of the secret service this week explained that the reports were inappropriate and based on a misunderstanding of metadata collected by NATO allies and exchanged with the United States .	-4.4660
Other revelations quoted from Snowden ’ s documents that NSA monitored the mobile phone of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and up to 34 other heads of state worldwide .	-3.3245
The head of the national intelligence services , James Clapper , defended the spying of allies as necessary and declared that this was customary on both sides .	-3.5511
In all the tumult , Murphy said that his authority is preparing the trip of the Congress to be held this year , and hoped that the delegation would include members of both parties and chambers .	-3.8764
The names of the other Members involved will be published in the coming days .	-2.5583
He said that the exact route is still being worked out .	-2.8203
While Murphy emphasized that the purpose of the journey was to improve relations , he also said that there would be some “ serious words . . , , , , , , , , , , , , , , ,	-8.5405
He said that European governments should be honest with their people about the kind of spy programmes they have been using for years .	-3.5839
“ While we can change our monitoring programs , thereby better protecting Europeans ’ rights , they must also accept the fact that we are not the only ones to spy , ” said Murphy .	-3.8047
Meanwhile , John Kerry is on the weekend a trip to the Middle East and Poland to deal with the grief about American strategy in Syria , Egypt , and Iran , as well as US surveillance activities .	-4.4880
A stubborn injury to the jumping joint threatens to prevent the use of Nicolai Müller in the Federal Foreign League of the FSV Mainz 05 at the FC Augsburg .	-4.3795
Mainz bnails for an operation of Nicolai Müller .	-2.6785
Tomorrow he will try to train with the team .	-1.4657
So far , he could only do this individually .	-2.8132
" We will decide on its use in the short term , " said Trainer Thomas Tuchel .	-2.7211

Australian appeals against prison sentences in Thailand	-1.7421
A 21-year-old Sydney woman who was sentenced in Phuket to 15 days in prison for being wrongly claimed to have been raped by a taxi driver has appealed against the judgment and was released on b.	-4.0550
Stevie Rochelle Bamford was initially found guilty of a provincial court in Phuket on June 15 to have made a false statement after having indicated to the Thai police , a local taxi driver raped them in the morning hours of Sunday 10 June , while two other men held them .	-4.6341
Later , however , a video camera showed that she had reached her hotel safely after she was separated from her Australian friend .	-4.2417
The police in Phuket interrogated Bamford for two days until they realized that history was thought out .	-4.5385
Until the trial , she was in police custody on the ground .	-3.2561
Bamford was sentenced to a 15-day prison sentence in a low-safety detention centre on the margins of Phuket , rather than a prison for adult women .	-3.7053
She is the daughter of Peter Tunks , a former player of the Australian Rubgy-League who turned to the Foreign Ministry of Canberra with the request for help for his daughter .	-3.8324
Tunks explained to the Sunday Telegraph in Sydney that the whole family was “ extremely worried ” about the well-being of his daughter and wanted to have them back in Australia .	-3.3435
“ Of course , we are very concerned about it , but we hope it will be back home as soon as possible , ” said Tunks .	-3.5977
Bamford has appealed against the judgment and is opposed to a deposit of 50,000 Baht on a free foot .	-9.5802
Australian reports she has read that she makes a holiday in Krabi in South Thailand in the meantime .	-4.9000
The Court had heard that Bamford was represented by a local lawyer in Phuket , and it was warned that the appeal could also lead to a higher sentence of up to two years in a prison for adults .	-4.3567
It is also possible , however , that after the recent murder of the travel shoppers Michelle Smith in Phuket , Thailand could strive to improve its tourist image , and that is why there is a freedom .	-6.2728
